            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Over the weekend, I've dug into a few more automated trading development
platforms. There are certainly <a href="http://www.elitetrader.com/so/">many out there</a>. This condensed
comparison is based on my own experience, online research, or reading
through their documentation. I only included the ones which I find to be
the best for each different level of <strong>independent</strong> developers. We'll
start with the most basic and work our way up the food chain.</p>
<h4>TradeStation</h4>
<p>Pros: Easy to learn and implement. Large Community.
Cons: Legacy system. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/departed-tradestation-and-going-down-the-ninja-trader-path/">Require work-arounds for complex functions</a>.</p>
<p>Who I think it's for: Algorithmic, technical analysis (traditional
indicators) trader. Light to no programming background.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tradestation.com">www.tradestation.com</a></p>
<h4>Ninja Trader</h4>
<p>Pros: Free for development use. Modern GUI. Use of major programming
language, C#. Good documentation and support.</p>
<p>Cons: Performance on the slow side. Proprietary API. <a href="http://codecrafter.wordpress.com/2008/06/08/ninjatrader-hangs-and-crashes/">Possible stability
problem</a>.</p>
<p>Who I think it's for: Medium to high programming background. Low cost
(free to develop or \$50/month for trading), good for independent
developer that has a long development time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ninjatrader.com">www.ninjatrader.com</a></p>
<h4>OpenQuant</h4>
<p>Pros: Good framework. Well built piece of software. Capable of advanced
techniques. "Lite" version of professional quant software by
<a href="http://www.quanthouse.com">QuantHouse</a>.</p>
<p>Cons: Only 1 month of trial period. Documentation and support seems
lacking.</p>
<p>Who I think it's for: Good to Advanced programming skills.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openquant.com">www.openquant.com</a></p>
<h4>Alphacet</h4>
<p>Pros: Latest and greatest. Codeless development capability. Faster
concept to deployment time.</p>
<p>Cons: Cost a fortune. Not tailored for independent developer.</p>
<p>Who I think it's for: Really experienced ATS trader with deep pockets.</p>

<p>Another week has gone by and still no sign of the bull yet. Perhaps the
smart money have begun hoarding shares? Perhaps the market makers are
scheming for another run down? Who knows. It doesn't matter anymore. The
fact is, I don't think we'll know for certain if a rally has occurred
until it's staring us in the face. But that's fine. Don't try to pick
the bottom. With the VIX at a new high of 96.4 last week, we could face
another free-fall of prices on just a hiccup in the market.</p>

<p>On the intermediate term, I am still bullish on the overall market. I
see the market will be more likely to be much higher than lower by the
end of the year. I came to this conclusion from the observation of
prices and volume this past 2 weeks. I made a post about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-sign-this-financial-bloodbath-is-ending-soon/">monitoring the
3 banks before the CDS settlement</a> for signs of trouble. Since then,
we continue to test the support on low volumes on the S&amp;P (see top
chart).</p>
<p>However, we're on to a fast down trend last week with increasing volume.
Next week would be interesting (which week isn't these days?) and Monday
should offer a sign of things to come. The indices have closed on a new
low this Friday. At this point, the bear is likely to make another dash.</p>
<p>Actually, I'd be more happy if we just get over with it and make a big
time plunge next week. It's certainly better in the long run than this
recent, prolonged, corpse-dragging process. That way, we can shake out
the recent, short-term bulls and clear an upward path with little
resistance.</p>
<p>As I've said, watch the action next week.</p>

<p>A great close today. Notice that we're testing the 910/920 (S&amp;P/SPY)
resistance with significant volume in the last hour of the day. The
volume is more than the level established at the resistance.</p>
<p>The same can be said of BAC and JPM. C's end-of-day volume didn't break
through. Recall that these are the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-sign-this-financial-bloodbath-is-ending-soon/">3 banks I said to watch for in last
week's CDS crisis</a>. In fact, Lehman's CDS settled without much
fanfare. See Lehman CDS settlement of \$5.2 billion.</p>
<p>I expect tomorow morning (was going to say 'day', but who knows these
days) to follow through with today's action. We'll see if we can close
the week higher for a triple-bottom, with 3 long tails, on the daily
chart. In particular, I'd like to see if we can break <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-down-of-this-weeks-trading-range/">above 940 for the
close as I have opined previously</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have worked with <a href="http://www.tradestation.com">TradeStation</a> for a few months earlier this year.
During that time, I worked for a few hours every single day on
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/easylanguage/">developing automated strategies</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/day-trading/">day trading</a> on it. I thought
TS was very good for use as a day trading platform. Particularly now
that I'm using ThinkOrSwim, I feel the TOS system is grossly inadequate
when compared to TS. However, I personally didn't like using TS as an
automated strategy development platform. EasyLanguage (TS's development
language) is definitely easy to learn and use. I would imagine EL would
meet the needs of many people and they'd be satisfied with it. On the
other hand, if you want to develop more complex strategies, the coding
can get complicated to the point of confusing, if it's even possible at
all. Like I never figured out how to build a simple neural net on it.
Besides the language, another limitation of TS is its inadequate API.
For example, and if I remember correctly, I had a hard time in the
programming trying to tie my portfolio value to the strategy. To
accomplish something simple like automatic portfolio balancing. Often
times, I wanted to do something but then found that I needed some
'work-arounds' instead. In essence, EasyLanguage is easy to get started,
but it certainly doesn't provide the depth which I wanted. Granted, it
was a great starting point for me in automated strategies development. I
learned a lot from it. Don't get me wrong though, a good strategy does
not mean a complicated strategy. One could have a profitable strategy
with just a few lines of code (moving averages, anyone?). What I want is
something that can serve as my creative sandbox. I wanted something that
can satisfy my wildest ideas. Actually, I just don't have sufficient
risk capital to let loose a strategy, so I have the luxury of not tasked
to yield results and is free to play with what I want. Including my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/stanford-machine-learning-lectures-pomdp/">POMDP discussion in my previous post</a>, and my other idea of using
modern control theory (my study focus back in the days) to identify
market inefficiencies. I couldn't have done those with EL without
over-complicating matters (DLL's, add-ons, etc.). The biggest factor
though, was the monthly subscription cost. I stopped my TS subscription
eventually because I just can't afford it. So what next? After some
digging, I came across <a href="http://www.ninjatrader.com">Ninja Trader</a>. They support C# programming in
their strategies. What's more, <strong>it's free</strong> for development use! I will
be using it with opentick for a free datafeed. Free platform, free data!
What more could I ask for? <strong>Update:</strong> It seems that opentick is
overloaded and haven't been taking on new users for a few months now.
I'll just use the simulated data within NT for now. <strong>Update 2009:</strong>
Opentick is now closed until further notice according to them. I have
began going through the NT tutorials and trying to refresh my distant
memories on some technical topics. After a few months of vacation, I am
back to the drawing board again. We'll see how it goes. I will document
my progress here under the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading category</a>.</p> </div>
