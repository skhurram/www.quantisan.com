<p>With VIX at a multi-year high and the current market turmoil, it seems
to be a good time to write about market volatility.</p>
<p>Market volatility is a two-edged sword. Day traders dream of catching
the 800 point swing in the YM contracts. Yet, most would lose more being
stopped out before giving up and then missing the swing. For long term
traders, these 800 point swing could cause panic (if you're on the wrong
side) or doubts (should you or should you not take the profit?).</p>
<p>Based on my brief experience in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/day-trading/">day trading</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures markets</a>,
I am not one to play with fire. For my longer term plays, I am <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/didnt-cut-losses-as-planned-and-now-paying-dearly/">feeling
the pain as we speak</a>. Thus, it is important to realize that although
market <em>volatility is very tempting for quick profits, greed never pays
in trading</em>. Another characteristic in a highly volatile market is that
there're a lot of emotions going on. As you know, emotions can cloud our
judgement. It's more difficult to trade when you're filled with panic,
fear, greed, excitement, etc.</p>
<p>In other words, market volatility is bad because 1) large swings both
ways at any time and 2) lots of emotions in the market and yourself.</p>
<p>To minimize your risk, it's better to minimize your exposure to the
market at times of high volatility. Thus, I use the rule that...</p>
<p><strong>If 50 dma of VIX > 20, then reduce position size to some % (i.e. 50%)
of usual amount.</strong></p>
<p>As a corollary, here's another interesting idea. It's widely known that
markets tend to creep up and plunge down, i.e. rising slow and steadily,
and fall quick and hard. Looking at the 50 dma VIX, it's actually a
quicker indicator for the 2007 top than my previous <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/back-to-basics-market-sentiment-via-2-line-ema-on-sp500/">2-line EMA
indicator for market sentiment</a>. Conceptually, if we accept that bull
market is slow and bear market is fast, then this idea of using VIX to
signal bull/bear sentiment do seem viable. However, there's already too
many IF's and assumptions for me to take this seriously. Therefore,
let's just stick with using volatility for managing position sizing
only.</p>

<p>One of the most, if not THE most, important theme in trading is
identifying if we're in a bull or bear market. It's easier to "ride with
the wave" than to fight against it. While there are an abundance of
work, studies, theories, or whatever, on calling out market sentiments,
I feel that the most useful way of doing it would be ones that stick to
the facts. And the only fact we can be certain of in the market is the
price.</p>
<p>So here's the idea (definitely not original) for <strong>guessing</strong> market
sentiment.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bull market = 50 dma > 200 dma for S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>Bear market = 50 dma \&lt; 200 dma for S&amp;P 500.</li>
</ol>
<p>As with any indicator, this is not a law. It's just a signal to give you
a piece of information for you to <strong>intrepret</strong> based on the
fundamentals and maybe other technical analysis tools.</p>

<p>I placed some limit sell on ESLR last Friday at \$6, and then lowered to
\$5.7. I lowered it again to \$5.6 in the morning and actually thought
of executing a market sell when it was around \$5.55. In that hour or
so, I pondered should I exit my ESLR to limit my exposure to market
volatility. At the time, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/slw-and-eslr-broke-support-and-stop/">ESLR was my weakest position</a>, and my 2nd
most money losing holding.</p>
<p>My intraday signals were showing weakness, but my daily was undecided.
Just before lunch, I decided to keep my shares (and cancelled my exit
working order) because I want to hold this for the long term (at least
weeks).</p>
<p>In retrospect, I really should trust my signals. I knew the market could
dive in the short term as we haven't reached capitulation and widespread
fear yet. I have let my emotion got the better of me by not wanting to
miss the bottom. In hindsight, the phrase "it's better to be safe than
sorry" couldn't have been more appropriate.</p>
<p>ESLR closed at \$3.47 yesterday, way below my initial <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-eslr-599848/">stop loss target
of \$5.6</a>. The time to cut losses short is long gone. It's either
surrender now or wait for the calming of the market.</p>
<p>I decided to wait through the storm in this round. I still think we are
very near the bottom. Hmm... haven't I said that before already when
ESLR was at \$6.0+ ... ?</p>

<p>Seriously, I will wait a few days until making an order. There's too
much emotion in the market at the moment. (i.e. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122346445779914857.html">WSJ: Central Banks Cut

<p>Dow Plunges 350 on Unemployment, Factory Reports. Lots of panic
headlines today. A definite 180 degree turn from yesterday's, and
another 180 from the day before. The flip-flopping sentiments of the
media are just too funny. This is definitely a time of high volatility
and uncertainty. Even at today's "plunge", the fact is, the markets are
still up from last week. We could very well be seeing the bottom being
set in this bear market. I think the worst of this downturn has unfolded
in the past year already.</p>
<p>In any case, I am definitely a bit early in my long term entries. Both
SLW (-15.6%) and ESLR (-14.1%) have broke support, but still far from
52-week lows. I am reluctant to sell at this time because the market is
in panic mode. Yet, both prices are below the stops I've set for myself.</p>
<p>I would go long on SLW at this price if I had the fund. The indicators
are on buy alert too.</p>

<p>ESLR is more risky at the moment because although the price is off a
lot, it's still dancing around the 20 dma. It could very well break the
52-week low from here.</p>
