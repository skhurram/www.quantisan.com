            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I ported <a href="http://engineering-returns.com/tsi/">Engineering Return's Trend Strength Index</a> to JForex as my
first practice to writing custom indicators in JForex. Frank's code in
TradeSignal consists of 9 lines. My JForex code? 191. This is my first
custom indicator in JForex. It will also be the last. A compiled
programming language such as Java is not the most convenient to use for
data analysis. The lack of interactivity because of the step of
compilation is one obstacle to fluent data explorations. Secondly, the
language itself is more cumbersome because of its generality. Java is
used to build all sorts of applications. Contrary to something like
MatLab, in which it is purposely built to work with numbers. I miss <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/starting-to-use-matlab-for-quantitative-finance/">the
days when I have my license for MatLab</a>. However, being forced away
from MatLab might not be a bad thing. As much as I've become accustomed
to it, MatLab isn't without its flaws. But I won't bash it in this post.
What I actually want to talk about is R. The rage these days in
statistical data analysis is in R (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29">Wiki entry on R</a>). I've done
some research and testing, R is really as good as they say it is (see
past publications in <a href="http://www.rinfinance.com/">R/Finance conference</a><a href="http://probability.ca/cran/doc/contrib/Farnsworth-EconometricsInR.pdf"></a>). You will get to see
some real examples in financial time series data analysis in R later in
this blog once I have some publishable results. This will no doubt take
some time as I am learning yet another new programming language (thus
the lack of posts this week). The plan from now on is to use R to play
with the data. Then once the algorithm is finalized, I will either port
it to Java (JForex) for deployment or <a href="http://www.rforge.net/rJava/">embed the R environment in
Java</a> for live trading.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Markets hitched a one-way train in the third quarter. TSX opened in July
at 11200. It closed September at 12368. A whopping 10% jump in three
months! S&amp;P500 made a similarly impressive 9.7% jump. We simply don't
get 10% moves even in most <em>years</em>. I made fewer trades this quarter but
held each one for longer to ride the trend. However, I am not as
successful as I'd hope. In particular, my worst trade this quarter was
in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/ven.to/">Ventana Gold</a> (VEN.TO). The position <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-350-ven-to-10-50-profit-0-8-re-bought-250-ven-to-10-67/">was profitable</a>, but the
money made was only a quarter as what I should have made. I was too
aggressive to go long when <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-400-ven-to-10-70-breakeven/">VEN.TO was heading into a brick wall</a>.
Ironically, my best trade this quarter was one that didn't make money.
In hindsight, I was wrong in the direction of a position but managed to
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-4-mfc-11jan-puts-14-00-1-74-mark-12-96-loss-0-1/">escape with just a scratch</a>. If I had been stubborn in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-jan-2010-puts-14-00-1-70-mark-13-25/">this failed
Manulife short</a>, my profit this quarter would have been wiped out. It
was a close call (technically, it was a put contract). It looks as
though I did <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-whole-year-two-hundred-and-six-posts-later/">learn something in the past year</a>. My main focus this
quarter has been the backend of my trading work. Namely in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative
finance study and development</a>. My automated strategy performed well
in the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> JForex contest. I won sixth place in July and first
place in August. My win streak (I also won in April) garnered the
attention from the people at Dukascopy and they kindly invited me to the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">Geneva Forex Event for a TV interview</a>. By far the most impressive
thing that happened to me this quarter was <a href="../pictures-from-geneva/">this trip to Geneva</a>.
<strong>Quarterly Metric Q3 Q2</strong> Sarting Fund \$9,404.87 \$8,000.00 End of
Quarter Fund \$9,630.75 \$9,404.87 Total Net Profit \$225.88 \$1,404.87
Gross Profit \$381 \$1,800 Gross Loss -\$155 -\$395 Profit Factor 2.45

this in the last quarter, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/june-and-second-quarter-2010-trading-review/">commissions are the bane of my trading</a>.
Last quarter it took away 11% of my total return. This time it's 54%!
The structure of my equities commission requires that I trade less but
punch hard. This isn't my style. My intention is to trade less by being
more picky in my RRSP trading account. The 0.85% max. drawdown this
quarter is impressive though. I sometimes lose more than that in a
single position. Sterling Ratio 0.22 1.44 Excess Return 2.29% 17.46%
SDev Return per Trade 1.01% 2.21% Kurtosis 1.89 -0.93 Skewness 1.65 0.72
Despite my modest 2.4% return this quarter, it's not a good number in
light of the market liftoff. My low <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/">modified Sterling Ratio</a> says so.
On the other hand, the statistics from my trades improved. I achieved
consistency by lowering the standard deviation of my trades and skewed
my trade returns more to the positive. Yet another thing to caution is
my high kurtosis value. Which means my total returns are due to big
profits from a couple of trades. Other than these, there is not much to
add about the rest of the data. 95th Percentile P&amp;L \$193.49 \$421.15

<h2>Goal for the Fourth Quarter</h2>
<p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/june-and-second-quarter-2010-trading-review/">goal from the previous quarter</a> is to learn and build my first indicator in JForex. I achieved
that just this week. However, I plan to change direction in my work by
using less JForex and using more custom tools. My goal for the next
quarter is to learn R programming and
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">implement a JForex to R
data exchange system</span> (done, good old CSV files).</p>

steam despite gold prices hitting record high seemingly on a daily
basis. VEN.TO made another attempt to break \$11.00 resistance level at
the open but it quickly reversed (Figure 1). I upped my stop order at
the open on this third attempt because I don't want to be holding it if
it fails for the third time. I'll just sit and wait for a while to see
how this one goes. Recent low at \$10.40 is the support to watch.
Coincidentally, the 50 daily MA just crossed over the 200 MA today for a
classic bullish signal (Fig. 2). A contrarian correction (downward) to
bleed off overbought condition is in play, perhaps?</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My Ventana Gold Corp (VEN.TO) stop got filled yesterday afternoon as
gold price took a dive (Figure 1) before the Bank of England minute
today. However, the support at 10.50 look very promising as VEN.TO made
a couple of successful long tail test of that level in the last 24 hours
(Fig. 2). Seeing that the BoE has blatantly admitted to support the
bandwagon on <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-28/posen-says-bank-of-england-should-buy-more-assets-to-support-economy.html">more quantitative easing</a> (along with the FED), the
bullishness in gold is written on the wall. As such, I am re-entering my
VEN.TO position this morning with a smaller amount of shares. New stop
is a close of VEN.TO below 10.50. Volatility is expected to be high. So
I am giving it some intraday leeway to move. A hard stop is set at
10.20. Risk is thus (\$10.67 - \$10.20) * 250 = \$117.50 + \$9.90
commission = \$127.40 = 1.3% of account. For the record, previous
entries were at <a href="../bought-200-ven-to-9-74-stop-8-90/">9.74</a> and <a href="../bought-150-ven-to-10-85/">10.85</a>. My stop at 10.50 was too tight.
I am admittedly being quite aggressive here. Let's wait and see if it
pays off.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I despise sellers of trading robots making misleading promises like
"doubling your money every month". They are nothing more than snake oil
salesmen exploiting on the greed and ignorance of others. Yet I am
finding myself in a similar situation lately. Ever since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">my interview
at Dukascopy</a> about my JForex automated trading contest win, I seem to
have established a persona for being able to generate 45%+ return per
month using my strategy. Despite my constant reiteration that this is
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/number-one-with-40-percent-return-in-a-month-so-am-i-rich-yet-not-really/">merely a lucky result in a risk-free game</a>, I am still getting
inquiries from people interested in following my trading signals. In
another attempt to rein in expectations, consider this chart of my
contest demo account balance for this month.</p>
<p><img alt="September 2010 JForex contest balance" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-09-27-contestbalance.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, my strategy doubled the account within days. However, it
also lost half of its paper value plus some more soon afterward. As it
stands now, my September strategy will not be in the top 10 for this
month.</p>
<p>If I haven't mentioned this embarassing negative return, you wouldn't
have noticed it, would you? That's the thing with trading contest and
those snake oil trading robots, we hear a lot about them when somebody
win. But what happens to those same people when they aren't winning or
the countless other unfortunate followers lost money?</p>
<p>This reminds me of the lottery system. Our perception of the probability
of winning the lottery is drastically distorted because we hear about
the winnings so much while neglecting the fact that there are millions
of losers out there.</p>
<p>The fact is, most of the seemingly impressive trading robots out there
will not last for the long term. The only reason that I have won three
times out of the five months is that I change my strategy's parameters
in expectation of the future month's market condition. That expection is
based on my own market analysis from my real trading. It isn't something
that can be readily quantified yet.</p>
<p>The way I see it, the only way in which others can exploit my success is
to buy my real secret trading system, which is, perhaps unfortunately,
my brain.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>S&amp;P500 managed to bounce back from below 1130 support. It is confirmed
by EUR/USD's rise and treasury's gap down (TLT) today. I'm not going to
argue with the market. So I am ditching my short for Manulife Financial
(MFC.TO) while it is still testing its 13.00 resistance at the open.
12.60 is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level for MFC. It made a textbook
perfect bounce on it (Fig. 1). Also, it's Friday today, so I'd rather
not have the time decay eat more out of my premium by holding over the
weekend. Loss for this trade is (\$1.74 - <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-jan-2010-puts-14-00-1-70-mark-13-25/">\$1.70</a>) * 100 * 4 = \$16
- \$27.90 = -\$11.90 = -0.10%. Now that I am out of my short position,
watch the market tank without me on board. Update: MFC and the market
managed an impressive rally today. MFC closed at 13.15. I am glad that I
followed my own strategy. I guess I do make <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">good timing once in a blue
moon</a>. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"
