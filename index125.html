            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>One of my favourite financial blogs, <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com">The Big Picture</a>, led us to this
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/10102008/watch.html">intellectual discussion of the current market crisis</a>. Highly
recommended for anyone seeking to make some sense of the current
turmoil.</p>
<p>
Here's an exerpt:

> **GEORGE SOROS:**And it's a false ideology. Both Marxism and market
> fundamentalism are false ideologies.
>
> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>Is there an ideology that...</p>
<p><strong>GEORGE SOROS:</strong>Is not false?</p>
<p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>GEORGE SOROS:</strong>I think the only one is the one that I'm proposing;
namely, the recognition that all our ideas, all our human constructs
have a flaw in it. And perfection is not attainable. And we must
engage in critical thinking and correct our mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>And that's one...</p>
<p><p>
<strong>GEORGE SOROS:</strong>That's my ideology. As a child, I experienced
Fascism, the Nazi occupation and then Communism, two false ideologies.
And I learned that both of those ideologies are false. And now I was
shocked when I found that even in a democracy people can be misled to
the extent that we've been misled in the last few years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a bit about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_soros">George Soros from Wikipedia</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soros' 2008 book, <em>The New Paradigm for Financial Markets</em>, describes
a "superbubble" that has built up over the past 25 years and is now
ready to collapse. This is the third in a series of books he's written
that have predicted disaster. As he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><div>
</p>
<p>
I have a record of crying wolfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. I did it first in
<em>The Alchemy of Finance</em> (in 1987), then in <em>The Crisis of Global
Capitalism</em> (in 1998) and now in this book. So it's three books
predicting disaster. (After) the boy cried wolf three times . . .
the wolf really came.
</div></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his
predictions are wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><div>
</p>
<p>
<strong>I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong</strong>*ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ I
basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often
used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you
are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight. When [I] make the
decision, the backache goes away.
</div></p>

<p>I mentioned previously <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/">about avoiding volatility</a>. But with VIX about
75 now, I couldn't help but to take the opportunity to day trade. I
know, I know, I said I wouldn't do it again. So I'm only trading an
account with<strong>paper money</strong>.</p>
<p>To illustrate the abundance of day trading opportunities these days, I
just launched my trading screen and within minutes I can see a viable
setup.</p>
<p>On the 1 minute chart on the left, notice the small doji at \$844 with a
high volume. Also off the chart is a low of \$837 for the day in the
morning. So \$840 is an effective support for the moment. Since the doji
at \$844 is above \$840, this is a good sign for the time being.</p>
<p>So I placed buy orders around \$845 for the next few minutes and exiting
below \$850 (obvious resistance), with intent to get back later in if it
breaks \$850 strongly. This went on for a few minutes, and I traded in
the range taking small profits twice, until the price broke to \$841.50,
which I stopped at a loss at around \$842.50.</p>
<p>However, noticing it's in a steady climb from then on, I entered a long
at \$845 again, with stop at \$841, for a longer trade. The price rose
to \$853.75, bounced back to \$850, and started dropping. I exited my
long at a small profit at \$849.50 on a retracement.</p>
<p>ES keeps dropping for those seconds until \$845.75 and bounced right
back to \$851. That was a good sign. I believe the initial \$850 break
and retracement was just a technical bounce. So I went in again at \$851
a bit later intending to ride it up to \$860.</p>
<p>That trade went as planned and I exited at \$858. I reversed and went
short at \$861 with a tight stop at \$863. The stop got hit and the
price went up to \$866.</p>
<p>I decided to stop there since the trading screen didn't lean much to
on-the-spot analysis. I'm not asking for a full charting screen though,
that would be overkill for day trading. Simplicity is key. I'd be happy
if they had 1-min and 15 min candlestick charts with 2-line EMA, MACD,
Stochastic, and volume information. In the end, I'm \$162.50 richer in
paper money after 12 trades.</p>
<p>Although it's a profitable session, I think I took way too many trades
to reach that.</p>
<p>Since my trading platform is very basic and isn't meant for day trading,
I didn't even have a chart on the trading matrix. I just looked at the
price movements and occasionally flip back to the chart. However, I do
have one good indicator for use... which is the price of Goldman Sachs
(GS). Long story short, we're in a financial driven crisis and GS (along
with MS and others) is one of the two surviving investment banks (of
original 5) in this mess. GS were off the lows of the day and moving up
very slowly throughout the few minutes which I day traded. That was a
good enough bullish sign for me to go long.</p>

<p>In light of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-capitulation-under-way/">market crash this week</a>, my ESLR is the holding that
worries me the most. It is the only one of my holdings without any
profit at the moment. At times like we're in now, ideally I would only
go long on the strongest companies, in the strongest sectors.</p>
<p>ESLR closed at 3.44 today. It's long term low is at 3.3. Here's a quick
reassessment of the situation.</p>
<p>Upside: Still above support level while markets are hitting new lows.
Lots of volume at the previous \$5 level. MACD and Stochastic showing
divergence, assuming it doesn't break support... definitely too early to
tell. Volume is uptrending on recent fall.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$4.</p>
<p>Downside: Low volume on recent small rally. Little volume today when
it's testing the low. Trend is still negative.</p>
<p>Support: \$3.3 and then ... \$2.50? Ouch!</p>
<p>Bottom line: Lots of panic and fear at the moment. Contrarian buy signal
perhaps? I'm not buying or selling at this level in any case. I'm going
to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/didnt-cut-losses-as-planned-and-now-paying-dearly/">stick to my plan and brace through this week</a>. Then I'll either
surrender my shares at a huge loss or keep holding for the longer term.</p>
<p>Here's my take on a purely speculative feel... the recent action on ESLR
seems like it's being accumulated by some big players. Two-stage
accumulation: 1) Huge reverse on new low to lure in chasers. 2) Price
drifts back down on increasing volume, but not too much to attract
attention. I don't know, this could be my emotion talking. That's why
I'm waiting for things to calm down first before making a move.</p>

The DJIA is too manipulated. <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/gm-falls-1950-levels-european/story.aspx?guid={C503DCF6-2571-42CD-AFA4-682958304034}">GM was downgraded today by S&amp;P</a>,
conveniently when GM is testing it's long term low. Just where the heck
were these guys a few weeks back? Do they think we're idiots? This is
blatant market manipulation! Anyway, enough with the vent. I was just
going to point out this week's market plunge with respect to the longer
term picture. S&amp;P 500 at 903 today is just shy of its 900 support. Next
support would be 750. The million dollar question is, will we see 750 or
1000 first?</p>
