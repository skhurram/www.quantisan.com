            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After watching the videos below, and from months of observation of this
latest global financial debacle, I am suddenly awashed with a feeling of
hopelessly powerless to this gross unfairness. In which the average,
hard working citizens are pouring money into the pockets of the filthy
and uber rich. If you don't know what I'm talking about here, watch the
video attached below for the tip of the ice berg in this on-going
problem. While Goldman is arguably the best at "legalized stealing" from
the moms and pops, they aren't the only crook on the block. Governments
around the world (not just the U.S.) were handing out money publicly
left and right in the past few months. And many still are. The whole
system is rigged as <a href="http://www.caracommunity.com">Bill Cara</a> has opined countless times in the last
few years. Bill's ingenious move to relocate his operation to the
Bahamas is only starting to shine in these months (to me). In addition
to voting with your ballot (which is useless if the whole system is
rigged), we can vote with our tax money by relocating our financial
operation. However, for those of us that still rely on a day job, this
is not an option. The best I can do right now is to become adequate with
managing our own money instead of depending on the financial salesmen.
This doesn't seem enough for me as the balance of power appears to be
getting worse by the day. Our government grossly tax us on one hand and
hand them out to the rich and well connected in the other. What have
others done/plan to do with regard to this unfair trap us working bees
are stuck in? The first video is Ratigan explaining how Goldman Sachs
made \$3 billions in 3 months (tipped by Stop Investing blog). The
second video is an interview with Michael Moore and Ratigan about where
all these loots are going now.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my successful EUR/JPY long just before the weekend with a tight
stop. Notice from Figure 1 that EUR/JPY is now in overbought territory.
In addition, a negative divergence is developing on the RSI from the
recent 2 peaks also at 135.00. The best thing about this trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-eurjpy-long-100-129-99-stop-128-80/">my
entry</a>. However, I certainly didn't chop this setup the best I could.
Even though I rode this up for +500 pips, I only had a 50% position
size. There were two easily identifiable adding points which I could
have taken advantage of. When EUR/JPY broke above 132.00, which was a
clear short-term resistance, a day after my entry I should have added to
my position then because of short-term momentum. Another chance came at
132.50 or so. As shown in Figure 2, when the price retested the low end
of the channel at 132.50. Both of these opportunities would have
survived with my usual stop of 100 pips. Another disappointment was that
my second half of the position was stopped out shortly because I moved
my stop up too soon. I was confident enough when I placed the order to
enter a full position size. But my over-zealous need to reduce risk got
the better of me. I observed on a daily time frame but traded in the
3-hour. To be more accurate in pointing the finger, it was my lack of
patience that stopped out my other half of the position. Anyway, I did
rode the wave with a sufficient position size. One thing I just noticed
is the T formation in Figure 2. EUR/JPY is back to where it started a
month ago. Where it heads now is uncertain. I will keep an eye on this
pair and aim to re-enter another long in a few days. The trend is your
friend.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>This log is written about 18 hours after the entry. I entered long
USD/CAD at the market last night for a 1/4 position size. USD/CAD took a
brief run up of about 100 pips. Naturally, I moved the stop to just
above breakeven to make this a risk-free trade for over the weekend. I
entered this position for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strong support at 1.0300, Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Positive divergence of lower low, higher RSI since August.</li>
<li>Break of short-term resistance, see Fig. 2</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that both Figures were taken at the time of entry 18 hours ago.
Position size: 25% Entry: 1.02988 Stop: 1.02080 Target: 1.0550, although
1.0400 might be hard to break. Reward / Risk = 251.2 / 90.8 = 2.7 \&lt; 3.
That's why I'm only entering a 1/4 position to test the water.</p>

                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-draft-your-own-3-rules-of-trading/" rel='bookmark'>How to Draft Your Own 3 Rules of Trading</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If you decide to write your own trading rules. Here's an explanation of
how I came about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">my 3 trading rules</a> and the reasoning behind them.
So why only 3 trading rules? There are several reasons for it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy to remember.</li>
<li>Easy to follow.</li>
<li>Easy to learn.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I've said in my 3 rules page, this list is not intended to be written
in stone. You are expected to progress from being restrained by it, to
being familiar with it, and then to being habitual with it. Thus, a
short list makes it easy to remember, to follow, and to learn. Once any
rule become an unconscious competency, you will not need it anymore and
it can be adapted or changed to address your new needs. Besides the
benefit of keeping it short, there's another reason why I'm using 3
rules. The three rules actually address my biggest trading <strong>weaknesses
in the past, present, and future</strong>. This is also the answer to this
post's title, how to draft your own 3 rules of trading. Let's get right
to it. The first rule is to tackle my archilles' heel, the bane of my
trading, based on my trading history. It is the single most important
thing that when I looked back and analysed my trades in the past few
months, or even years, which would have made my trading better. It could
be a trading strategy tweak, a trading psychology note-to-self, or a
risk management rule. Anything goes. And if that didn't really help,
consider using a popular hypothetical scenario, if you can go back in
time, what would you have told yourself back then to improve your
trading? The second rule is derived from asking the question, what is
the most important thing that I can do
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">now</span> with all of my
trades to increase my odds in this game? Let's use a hypothetical again.
Imagine that there is a trading guru here trading with you now and
watching you trade, what would s/he tell you? The last rule is to
address the future. What can you do in the times to come that can make
the most difference in your trading? What is this next step you can take
that will start the wheel going on your journey to becoming the trader
that you want to be? Whatever your trading rules are, the <strong>most
important rule</strong> about drafting your own trading rules is to be as
specific as you can. Vague or unclear rules are worse than useless
because they can give a false sense of security. Consider these three
#3 rules about the same idea. I want to ...</p>
<ol>
<li>Improve on my trades.</li>
<li>Improve on my trades by studying my trading history.</li>
<li>Improve on my trades by studying any trade with performance
    statistics beyond the middle 50% quartile.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll let you be the judge on which style you prefer. If you didn't read
any of the above, remember this, the most important rule (yes, I lied
above) for drafting your trading rules is to just write them down and
follow them. No matter what you wrote, you will eventually find ways to
improve on it if you are diligent about them. So just start somewhere
and go with it.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>It looks as though my analysis for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-gbpjpy-in-142-861-stop-141-16/">GBP/JPY making a reversal</a> was
correct. However, my short term entry needed to be improved for me to
profit on my intermediate term analysis. In particular, I should have
looked at a major short term resistance line instead of an arbitrary
weak resisitance line as I did when I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-gbpjpy-in-142-861-stop-141-16/">entered the long
previously</a>. That didn't go so well as I was
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-out-gbpjpy-141-70-116-10-pips/">stopped out soon afterward</a> when GBP/JPY was consolidating. In
hindsight, if I'm to try for a reversal, at least wait for the price to
break a strong short term resistance and then use the recent low as the
stop. The preferred resistance line for GBP/JPY in this missed trade can
be seen in Fig. 1, which I drew many days ago and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-gbpjpy-in-142-861-stop-141-16/">also can be
seen</a> in my previous entry (Figure 2 on that
page, the higher of the 2 lines). New Figure 2 attached below shows the
bigger picture of GBP/JPY in a daily chart to see what could have
perspired. My target of 148 was spot on too!</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>EUR/USD looked as though it was going to break through 1.50 when it
broke 1.49 (Fig. 1). I waited til it marked a short term top at 1.4920
(Fig. 2) and then placed a stop entry just above it at 1.4921. EUR/USD
traded above it for a few hours but failed to break 1.4970. It has now
retraced to a short term support. If it continues to decline, the double
divergent top will be all written over the wall (Fig. 1) and it'll be a
good short for the next few weeks. Until it moves out of this trading
range though, this is still an uncertain trade. On another note, I have
now had a string of 7 consecutive losses. Good thing these are merely
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trades</a> for experimentation. Looking over the history and
statistics, it's apparent that many of these trades were taken to <strong>try
for the top/bottom</strong> just after signs of reversal in the short term
(except for this EUR/USD trade, which is with the trend). Thus, from now
on, if I'm to go against the intermediate trend (daily), limit my
position size by reducing a 50% position size entry to a 33% entry, at
most. Furthermore, only enter when the instrument has marked a short
term lower top and has broken the immediate support. After paper trading
for a month, my forex trending strategy is finally starting to take
shape...</p>
