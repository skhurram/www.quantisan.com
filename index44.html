            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Warning: Top/bottom picking is a dangerous art. I don't intend to trade
on this information myself. I did this out of pure curiosity. The
Canadian banks are an interesting phenomenon. Are they just hiding dirt
under the rug or are they really as good as our government say? Mish
Global Economic Trend Analysis posted a bearish view on <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2010/03/california-usa-vs-ontario-canada-which_29.html">California v.
Ontario</a>. Furthermore, The Baseline Scenario discussed [why the
strength of our banks is an illusion created by our government][]. As
such, on both a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/td-bank-making-headlines-with-a-new-all-time-high/">technical</a> and fundamental viewpoint, share prices of
our financial sector is way overbought. Of which, CIBC (CM.TO) seem
particularly screwed as its stock price hasn't been able to join in the
unreal rally of late. That sentiment seem to be confirmed with an
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/using-option-pain-max-pain-to-estimate-stock-price/">option pain valuation</a> as I described before. Max pain for CM.TO for
April expiration is pegged at \$72. Not surprisingly, \$72 marks a long
term support as shown in Figure 2 (blue line). A break below \$72 could
summon \$65. The data also show that there is a large open interest for
put options at the \$72 strike. Are they sold as covered puts or
something else? That I cannot tell. However, \$72 will definitely be an
important level for CM.TO in the near future. Nevertheless, as the
options market is small in Canada, I wouldn't put much weight on options
valuation for Canadian stocks. The value of open interest options on
April CM.TO is merely about the size of a single day's of equity traded.
P.S. March's max pain was \$68 one week prior to expiration. But CM.TO
closed above \$75 on March expiration. That wasn't even close.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Earnings season is approaching as the first quarter of 2010 comes to a
close this week. In April, companies will try to woo us with their
numbers and outlooks. With the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-first-analysis-of-the-sptsx-60-index/">market looking so toppy</a> already, how
will the market react? Consider Figure 1. Past 3 earnings season since
the epic rally from March of 2009 have consistently been followed by
market corrections (blue lines). Will we see the same selloff in a
couple of weeks? As the Shocked Investor points out, "... positive
surprises will be harder and harder to come by. Given that the markets
are even more overvalued now, there is <a href="http://shockedinvestor.blogspot.com/2010/03/markets-drop-during-earnings-season.html">reason to expect similar
behavior</a>." On the other hand, this quarter's earnings report will be
the first time in which the year-over-year value will be compared to <em>a
period in the worst of the fallout</em> (see Q1 of 2009 in Figure 1). As
such, it will no doubt be easier to paint a pretty picture as anything
compared to an apocalypse will look good. With the market squeezed
between the bulls and the bears entering earnings releases, the next few
weeks should be interesting.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>A bank making an all-time high! Another reason not to short this market
<em>just yet</em>. However, the fact this made the news is a tempting short
prospect. I just saw TD Bank making <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/blogs/streetwise/td-bank-stock-hits-new-record/article1516929/">the headline today on Globe and
Mail</a>. TD.TO is running away from the pack. See Figure 1 on TD.TO
versus TSX Financial Index. TD is trending bullishly away from the rest
of the banks gradually since end of 2007. Why? I have no idea as I don't
follow it. Moreover, TD is making a bullish dead cross (50 over 200
moving averages) on the weekly chart of Figure 2 (marked with circle).
That is very bullish indeed. Nevertheless, there is an obvious long-term
negative divergence as TD is making a new high as shown in Figure 2.
Secondly, if you observe Figure 1 again, you will see that TD/SPTFS is
testing a strong resistance. There is evidently a conflict between the
bulls and bears. Price is telling one story and the indicators are
telling another. Either way, this stock will be a good one to watch.
Patience on the short for now... I am hunting to short something in the
energy sector. No shorting Canadian financials for me. I am not crazy.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If the idea of handing your RRSP contributions over to a sales person
(a.k.a. financial advisor) at a bank isn't appealing to you, then it is
time to consider your investment choices. I am about to contribute for
the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/considering-investment-options-for-my-first-rrsp/">first time ever into my RRSP</a> this year. So I performed my due
diligence by researching and evaluating my choices. This post is a
ranking of my findings. I evaluate each investment strategy according to
three criterias, in descending order of importance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk</strong>. Will I lose sleep at night if I put all my money in it?</li>
<li><strong>Reward</strong>. How much can I potentially gain?</li>
<li><strong>Effort</strong>. How much time and energy do I need to spend on it?</li>
</ul>
<p>My overall portfolio is exposed to enough risk already from my other
trading activities. So my risk appetite is leaning towards a
conservative approach. Also note that I factor in costs as a part of my
risk assessment. I place a 40% emphasis on this criteria. Next, I
consider the return of each investment vehicle using a 40% weight. For
obvious reasons. Lastly, I prefer something that requires as little time
and effort as possible. I weight this criteria at 20%. As I've said
numerous times, I don't like the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/">limitations in a registered
account</a>. It is like trying to invest with one hand tied behind my
back. I do not want to put much effort to manage this account because I
can do better in my regular trading. The resulting ranking of the six
types of markets <em>that I am considering</em> for my RRSP (and TFSA) is as
follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Guaranteed savings</li>
<li>Indices or sectors (through passive mutual funds or ETF's)</li>
<li>Fixed income (using a mutual fund or ETF bond index)</li>
<li>Gold</li>
<li>Stocks</li>
<li>Actively managed mutual funds</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing of note about investing in physical gold within a registered
account is that it can only be done at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> as far as I know.
Although I doubt they are the only one. Here is the table I used to
estimate this ranking. I give each category a score from 1 (bad) to 5
(good) based on my own experience and my sentiment of future market
condition. So yes, it is a very crude guess at best. Nevertheless, the
table shows that my best choice is to either put my RRSP money in a
savings account or invest in indices using passive mutual funds (like
the TD e-Series) or ETF's. However, I plan to do both. I will trade
indices in my RRSP and put my TFSA money in a high yield savings
account. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="493" caption="RRSP
