            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>In the unfortunate case that you are holding a massive losing position
in your portfolio and don't know what to do, the first step to fight
back is to reassess the situation with a rational, unbiased mind. Easier
said than done. But that is what I learned the hard way a few years back
when I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/emfp-the-trade-that-broke-me/">bankrupted my trading account in a single stock</a>. I waited for
weeks and then months. While checking online forums for discussions on
the stock, eager for others to fuel my hope. Hopes for the stock to come
back to some better price so that I can unload. 3 years later, the
company's stock price is still screeching along the zero mark. While I'd
like to think that I have come a long way since then, there is no
guarantee that I won't find myself in that situation again. As such, I
developed a self-assessment questionnaire with questions that needed to
be asked in a crisis. But often not because people are always too
emotionally caught up. It is like an emergency checklist for the
emergency. Here are my 10 questions to ask yourself when nothing is left
but false hope in a dire trading position:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is your current account drawdown compared to your previous
    performance?</li>
<li>How proven is your trading system?</li>
<li>Are your reasons for entering this position still valid?</li>
<li>Is the reason for letting the trade breakaway from you within your
    trading strategy?</li>
<li>What are the emotional reasons to hold this trade?</li>
<li>What are the logical reasons to hold this trade?</li>
<li>What are the emotional reasons to exit this trade?</li>
<li>What are the logical reasons to exit this trade?</li>
<li>What can you do to reduce your overall risk?</li>
<li>And last but not least, WHAT IF the price breaks against your trade
    even further?</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, once the crisis is over, it is time to reflect and review
what went wrong to prevent this from happening again. After all, at
least make something out of this by learning and improving. And if you
can, please share with us your learning experience in the comments below

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been stopped out of all my Aussie shorts on the breakout today. But
my setups for AUDUSD and AUDJPY are still intact as the resistances are
still safe. Having failed so many times in shorting AUDJPY (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">first
try</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-retrying-audjpy-short-84-52-stop-85/">second try</a>), I am taking a conservative approach on that
particular play. Although those setups are ripe for entries, I'll wait
til the test of resistances hold first before entering short again in
AUDJPY and AUDUSD. Which begs the question of, why AUDCAD, and why now?
First of all, I still have conviction about my Aussie short because of
the setups as <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">discussed previously</a> and the fact that gold
price is holding the 40 day ema at 1135 at the moment. That 40 day ema
has worked well on the uptrend in the past few months. So it should be
respected if gold is indeed in a downtrend now as I surmise. So why
short AUDCAD instead of the popular AUDUSD? Simply because AUDUSD broke
out of a short term range whereas AUDCAD is still holding as seen in the
AUDCAD 3-hour chart of Figure 1. This shows AUDCAD is weaker even when
gold is making new short term high.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUD/CAD,
3-hour"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_3h.PNG" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>For the big picture, see Figure 2 for the weekly chart of AUD/CAD. We
see that 0.98-0.99 has always been the turning point for a massive 1000+
pips selloff. We've hit 0.99 back in November and the slide is already
in progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see from Figure 2 that AUDCAD bounced off the 40 week ema
in late December and ran up to 0.95 from 0.92. 0.95 is a decidedly
important round number resistance as it was also a peak in April of
2007. You know, the time before the economy started to crack as shown
with the topping in the markets.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUDCAD,
weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD.png">1</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Now that I've established that the trend is pointing down. I still need
to time my short entry.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the daily chart of AUDCAD. In view of the above
discussion, we have a good chunk of resistance above 9550 as marked by
the purple box in Figure 3. This is the all important safety net for
this short entry. As long as AUDCAD stays below 9600, this long term
setup remains intact. And don't forget the broken uptrend line.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUDCAD,
daily"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_day.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_day.png">2</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Lastly, notice the RSI trends in both the 3-hour (Fig. 1) and daily
charts (Fig 3.), they are both showing negative divergences. Figure 1 is
my timing for this entry, see the current negative RSI divergence marked
by the downward trend in RSI versus the toppy price.</p>
<p>In summary, here are my signals for this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC setup</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Weekly chart shows downward trend.</li>
<li>Big resistance above current price on daily.</li>
<li>Broken uptrend line on daily on retracement from weekly chart.</li>
<li>Intermarket relation with gold testing 40 day ema at 1135.</li>
<li>Negative RSI divergence on 3-hour chart.</li>
</ol>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">previous AUDJPY short entry</a> was early as I surmised (entered
without short-term confirmation). I made a number of ins and outs with
that trade as depicted in Figure 1. Some were winners, some were losers.
In all, it's around breakeven in that trade. However, I have re-entered
this short in AUDJPY just now at 84.52 using <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">the same long term
setup</a> (see weekly chart in that post) as
it hasn't been broken yet. Moreover, AUDJPY is in the process of making
a negative divergence on the 3-hour chart as shown in Figure 1. The key
word is "in the process". There is still a possibility of a breakout
upward from here. I am being aggressive to establish a position here
because of intermarket divergence in Aussie crosses versus gold price
overnight. See Figure 2. As you can see, gold made a marginally higher
high above 1130 on the 4-hour chart of Figure 2. Yet, neither AUDUSD nor
AUDJPY followed suit. Those two currency pairs are holding their
respective double top. The exception is EURAUD, it keeps diving
downward, but that can be accounted for by Euro weakness. It would have
been a perfect picture of EURAUD can hold its bottom though. I wouldn't
count this trade to work out just yet. That's why I'm only risking 0.2%
of my account with a small <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">position size</a> for now. As you can see
from my trade orders shown in Figure 2. I have a couple limit orders
just below the near-term supports to add to this short. My pawns have
been placed. Let's wait and see what the market does.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The rise in popularity of social sites for trading has paved the way for
ever more unscrupulous trading system sellers to spread their high yield
scams. Just to be clear, I am not against websites such as <a href="http://www.myfxbook.com">Myfxbook</a>
and <a href="http://www.covestor.com">Covestor</a>, nor against trading system sellers in general.
However, there are always bad apples in a basket. And there are many bad
apples out there. Trading social sites typically nurture a community of
traders by enforcing <strong>transparent</strong> and <strong>audited</strong> trading history.
Unfortunately, it is because of this claim, people are enticed by
trading systems showing unbelievable high yields of 200%, 400%, 800%, or
even more in mere weeks on sites such as Myfxbook or Covestor. But if
the history of every trade taken is published and the account is
verified, doesn't that mean that they are just really that good? First
of all, if these people can double or triple their accounts in a few
weeks or months as they claim, why the heck are they selling their
system to you for a few hundred bucks and lose their monopoly?! If you
have a Lamborghini in your garage, do you rent it out for a few hundred
bucks to total strangers? Common sense should be on red alert. For sake
of argument, let's say that you give them the benefit of the doubt. All
is not as simple as it seems though. Here is one old trick in the book
scammers may use to game a transparent and audited trade history. I will
use <a href="http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Pheniox/sir-lancelot/1806">one of the top performers currently on Myfxbook</a> to illustrate
how their scam work. And surprise, surprise, this particular system is
on sale for a limited time (will see why later) for only US\$365. Figure
1 is the account percentage growth graph of this particular system. 488%
gain in 4 months!</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Account growth
chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_balancecurve.png" />][][/caption] Let's take a look at the trading performance
statistics. Remember, these are <strong>real, audited numbers</strong>.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Trade
performance statistics"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradestats.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradestats.png">1</a>[/caption] Aside from the impressive
90% success rate (something <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-goldman-sachs-robbed-you-and-me-of-3-billions-in-3-months/">only Goldman Sachs can achieve</a>
consistently), the rest of the numbers actually look quite normal.
Notice that their average pips won and lost are both around 13 pips. So
this is supposedly a short-term scalping strategy to catch small but
high probability moves. Which does exist in real life, as you know. Then
as if you're not convinced of their awesomeness yet, here's a snapshot
of some recent trade history.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Trade
history"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradehist.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradehist.png">2</a>[/caption] This is where you might start to raise
some eyebrows. Observe that 5 out of 8 trades shown are minuscule gains
but they have <strong>no stop loss</strong> in place! That's not a problem, per se.
Some systems don't use an open stop order. However, notice the open and
closing time. These suspicious trades were held for almost a day! That's
like an eternity for a scalping system. Who knows how much drawdown have
occurred in the account during those hours! Actually, we do, take a look
at the figure below for an open order of this system.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Open
trade"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_opentrades.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_opentrades.png">3</a>[/caption] Caught red-handed! The open order shows a
gigantic loss running. See the -\$9290 loss being held? That's about a
third of their current balance of \$29k! But here's the trick. What the
system does is wait for market noise to swing the price back to
breakeven and then close the trade for a +1 pip. As the trade isn't
closed at the moment, this humongous drawdown doesn't count as a loss
and is nowhere to be seen in the trading history. That is what happens
with many of those unusually small pips but long-held trades as
discussed above. In effect, they are risking their entire account
balance on just a few pips of profit on every trade. The reason why many
of these unbelieveable systems typically have a trade history of only a
few months at most? That isn't just for show. Sooner or later, their
luck runs out with this no-stop rule and the market will have them choke
down those monstrous losses. Eventually, their account just blows up.
But at that point, they can make a switch-aroo and pull up another
trading history that hasn't blown up yet to replace this one that just
failed. Then it's business as usual. What's more amusing is thatsomeone
asked this question of why there is a huge drawdown in another huge
drawdown open trade months ago. The response from the author is that it
was just a careless programming mistake. Imagine, here they are selling
a massively "profitable" system on one hand and then claiming a glitch
on another. In summary, <strong>the key to a statistically 100% winning
system</strong> is simple. Follow the trend with no stop and only close a trade
with a positive gain. But as I've explained the fallacies with this
approach above, <strong>never try that with your money</strong> as you are risking
all for so little! For general advice on avoiding forex scams, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex_scam">Wikipedia entry</a> offers an overview and ForexCrunch has a good
article on <a href="http://www.forexcrunch.com/forex-scams-7-ways-to-avoid-them/">7 Ways to Avoid Forex Scams</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I haven't done one of these <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/entry/">trade analysis post</a> for weeks. So I
thought I'll start the year on this promising long term (more than a
week) trade on one of my favourite currency pairs, AUD/JPY. This entry
on shorting AUD/JPY is executed according to my Forex Trend Reversal
(FTR) setup. Figure 1 shows the weekly chart. Please excuse the mess.
There are only 3 relevant lines in addition to the price. Referring to
Figure 1, first line of note is the top of that 4-line descending
channel. Notice that 84.50 correspond with the resistance this week.
Secondly, there are 3 ascending trendlines drawn. We have a triple
X-cross on the 2 ascending and 1 descending lines at around 85.00 last
week. AUD/JPY failed to touch it. If this trade goes well, AUD/JPY
shouldn't test 85.00 again because it has missed its chance. That's
where I placed my stop. Anyway, these are just doodles on a chart, we
need confirmations. For that, let's take a look at the major Aussie
crosses and gold prices in Figure 2. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"
width="580" caption="AUD/JPY, weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-04-AUDJPY.png" />][][/caption] [caption id=""

the 4-hour charts of Figure 2. From top to bottom, Figure 2 shows
AUD/USD, EUR/AUD, AUD/JPY, and GC (gold futures). We also see that gold
prices is staying at a depressed level below 1120. This rising Aussie
but toppy gold price is a sign of divergence. Furthermore, we have a
shooting star candlestick pattern in the previous gold price bar. Gold
spiked above 1130 briefly but couldn't hold above 1120 so far. Another
plus for the short. Now that the entry signals have been met. I needed
to time my entry. This the the part that I should have done better. I
basically just shorted it at the '50 resistance without giving it much
thought. The short-term bullishness is still strong and I really should
have waited for a lower high on the 3-hour chart. Figures 3 and 4 are

smallish position in this trade at an obvious resistance level. My
intention is to add to it as long as AUD/JPY stay below 85. Also, a
safer stop should be 85.50 as seen from Figure 3 (daily). 84.40 was a
recent top in October. Lastly, I chose to short AUD/JPY instead of
AUD/USD because I have some other U.S. dollar longs already.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/november-2009-trading-performance-review/">set 2 goals back in November</a> for December. 1) Think more,
trade less; and 2) Be more aggressive on winners. With 276 trades in
December, I have failed miserably for goal #1. I couldn't meet my
second goal either as I've missed most of the big moves from failing to
recognize the bigger picture. Nonetheless, I ended up the month +2.71%
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">in my demo account</a> by picking pennies here and there and with the
help of some<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">decent risk management</a> to limit my risks. Overall, it
was a bad month for me because of too much time spent trading with
little reward to show. I noticed my over-trading tendency early in the
month. My solution was to [limit myself to the longer timeframe to
reduce moving in and out of trades][] too frequently. Reviewing that
particular post, I was spot on with identifying my problem. However, my
over-trading problem lingered on for the rest of the month (i.e.
"staring at the trading screen too much once I am in a position and
tried to micro-manage my trades to minimize my risk"). While this can be
attributed to the more volatile market in December (discussed later),
the real downside of my over-trading can be seen in Figure 1 showing my
demo account balance graph for December.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="December 2009
Account Balance"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/december_2009_account_balance.png" />][][/caption] Notice the following
characteristics in Figure 1.</p>
<ol>
<li>two up-spikes in the month (around the 8th and 17th)</li>
<li>a slow, barely-upward grind in the middle of the month (from 9th to
    16th)</li>
<li>a marching drawdown at the start and end</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 was mostly luck. I was in the right position at the right time. #2
was the grind as it should be. I intend to delegate this type of trading
to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading system</a> once it's developed (haven't even
started yet though). But for the moment, it's all manual. What's most
concerning is #3. Sometimes it's just better to not trade at all. That
is something which I still need to learn to do. Evidently, I still need
to work on narrowing my trading setup to filter out these erroneous
trades. I outlined the new steps for that [in my previous post][limit
myself to the longer timeframe to reduce moving in and out of trades]
already. I just need discipline to follow my own advice.</p>
<h2>Performance Statistics</h2>
<p><strong>Monthly Metric December (November)</strong> Sarting Fund \$5,469.11 End of
Month Fund \$5,617.44 Total Net Profit \$148.33 (\$166.90) Gross Profit
\$591 (\$598) Gross Loss -\$443 (-\$431) Profit Factor 1.34 (1.39) Net
Profit % 2.71% (3.15%) Max. Drawdown % 1.91% (3.44%) The above stats
look consistent with the previous month's data in brackets. My maximum
drawdown actually improved significantly down to 1.91% from 3.44%. That
is due to the fact that I took a lot more small trades to rake in
pennies rather than bet big on big moves. Frankly, I would prefer the
latter strategy as I don't typically have so much time. Sterling Ratio
0.41 (0.41) Excess Return 2.66% (3.10%) SDev Return per Trade 0.12%
(0.19%) Kurtosis 17.38 (3.45) Skewness 3.30 (1.54) Comparing my
performance statistics using <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/">my new modified Sterling ratio</a>, it's
coincidentally exactly the same as November. My maximum drawdown
improved but its benefit in the equation is cancelled out by the
increased volatility in December. My ultimate target is to achieve a
consistent monthly modified Sterling Ratio of 0.50 or above. The
kurtosis and skewness statistics got a lot worse this month. These are
expected from the large number of small trades and the few big
profitable trades as seen in Figure 1. However, what's alarming is the
data below. 95th Percentile P&amp;L \$11.97 (\$23.20) 5th Percentile P&amp;L
-\$5.73 (-\$10.31) Net Profit Mid 90% Only -\$46.96 (\$33.82) As you can
see, it would have been a losing month if it weren't for the outlier
trades. This is definitely the most worrisome statistic this month. <strong>I
need to stop picking pennies and concentrate on bigger moves.</strong> Total #
of Trades 276 (153) Percent Profitable 40.77% (46.36%) # of Winning
Trades 95 (70) # of Losing Trades 138 (81) # of Break-even Trades 43
(2) As I've said before, I took the most number of trades this month
since my short forex career. My percent profitable drifted farther below
50% to 40.77%. I might as well throw random dart to make my pick. This
has once again proven that I over-traded and didn't spent enough time
with my analysis. The large number of break-even trades is also a
sore-sight in the data. Average Trade Profit % 0.01% (0.02%) Average
Winning % 0.11% (0.16%) Average Losing % -0.06% (-0.10%) Ratio Win% /
Loss% 1.94 (1.61) Max. Conseq. Winners 9 (12) Max. Conseq. Losers 18
(14) Largest Winning Trade \$47.44 (\$41.88) Largest Losing Trade
-\$11.64 (-\$20.34) Avg. Time Held [hrs] 0.26 (0.56)</p>
<h2>Goal for January</h2>
<p>There's only one goal for me for January and it's the same as
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/november-2009-trading-performance-review/">November</a>'s. <strong>Think more and trade
less</strong>! Refer to my post on <a href="../focusing-on-trading-my-timeframe-to-reduce-over-trading/" title="Permanent Link to Focusing on trading my timeframe to reduce over-trading">Focusing on trading my timeframe to reduce
