    </h1>

    <div class='article-content'>
        <p>I spent most of 2008 trading futures and developing automated systems on
Tradestation. The futures trading didn't turn out so well as I lost 40%
of my account and had to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/retirement-from-futures-trading-and-back-to-stocks/">call it quit</a>. My quant development work on
the other hand, was coming along slow but steadily. However, since I
couldn't bear the monstrous maintenance fee anymore at <a href="http://www.tradestation.com/">Tradestation</a>,
I had to abandon that work. Then last year <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-thoughts-and-goals-on-automated-trading-a-year-later/">when I wanted to pick up
where I left off</a> on Matlab, I found that I couldn't just continue my
work. For one, I've lost most of my files. I think I left them in my
other computer in Hong Kong. Which is probably in a landfill by now.
Secondly, I didn't keep a thorough journal <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2008/">back then in 2008</a> like
I'm doing now. Lastly, from the important files that I've kept, I didn't
bother to convert the codes because I might as well write new ones from
scratch than figure out what I did. The reason why I am reminiscing at
the moment is because I am finding myself in the same cycle again. As
regular readers may be aware, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-to-do-when-life-gets-in-your-way-of-trading/">recent events</a> have accelerated my
quant projects schedule. I am experimenting with using Metatrader 4 for
my foreign exchange trading and scripting in MQL4 for automated trading.
Like Tradestation, <a href="http://www.metaquotes.net/en/metatrader4">Metatrader 4</a> is a trading platform with scripting
capabilities. Its programming language, MQL4, is a proprietary language
based on C. I took a few hours this weekend to learn it (as I'm familiar
with C already). So that I can start coding this week. However, after
giving it more thought, I've decided to scale down on my projects with
MQL4. I don't want to rely on a proprietary system for short-term
convenience. As trading programmers know, the language used is merely a
choice. Experience tells me that the bulk of development time is not
spent on the actual programming itself. Rather, much of the time is
spent on formulating, analyzing, and optimizing your algorithm. So I
might as well bite the bullet to build from scratch my automated trading
systems and quant analytics on one platform (i.e. on Python). That has
been my long term plan all along. Everything under one roof. But I
digressed. Then there's the issue of re-useability. Metatrader 4 is
forex-only and only works with brokers that support it. As such, I would
have to use something else for stock trading. Even for a forex-only
system, it would help if I can do intermarket analysis quantitatively.
That's not possible as far as I know with MQL4. Which is another major
downside for me. To summarize other reasons on how I came about this
decision, here are the advantages and disadvantages of using MQL4 versus
using a general programming language, such as Python or C++. The
advantages of using MQL4 are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Saves A LOT of development time as it's already built for trading</li>
<li>Charting, manual and automated trading on one platform</li>
<li>Based on the popular C programming language</li>
<li>Many forex traders use it</li>
<li>Large repertoire of forex-specific programs</li>
</ol>
<p>Disadvantages of using MQL4.</p>
<ol>
<li>Not for real quant analysis or data mining</li>
<li>Limited to MT4-supported brokers</li>
<li>Forex trading only</li>
<li>Proprietary programming language</li>
<li>Must run on Metatrader 4 client terminal</li>
<li>MQL5 coming soon</li>
</ol>
<p>This is certainly a tough choice. Judging by the huge user base, it's
evident that many people are satisfied with MQL4. Yet, as I've discussed
here, there are downsides to using it (besides technical matters). My
current plan remains the same as what I said in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">my last month's trading
review</a>. That is, I will use MQL4 to plug holes in my trading system
for now before migrating to build my own system. In fact, I am already
brewing my first expert advisor starting today. Perhaps I might even
have something to post by the end of this week.</p>
