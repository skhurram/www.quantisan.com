            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I placed this EUR/JPY long order a couple of days ago. It just got
triggered overnight in the Pacific market hours. See Figure 1 for my
entry chart. Note the following reasons for long EUR/JPY:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support trendline coincide with round number 130.00</li>
<li>RSI in oversold territory and moved up</li>
<li>EUR/JPY in a trading range with the MA's oscillating since April</li>
</ol>
<p>EUR/JPY was testing 131.00 when I placed this order and I didn't think
it would get triggered. I placed a full 100% position in this but 1/2 of
my position has a trailing stop of 50 pips and it got run down within a
few hours of entry. That 1/2 was out at 129.666 for a loss of 3.33 pips.
I'm only left with a 1/2 position in this at the moment. In hindsight,
that trailing stop was too close as the 3-hour ATR is 25-30 pips. Entry:
129.99, round number support Stop: 128.80, see Figure 2, just below
recent low and support line Target: 134.00, see Figures 1 and 2. At the
bottom range of a congestion zone. Reward / Risk = 401 / 119 = 3.4 > 3.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>In addition to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdchf-50-long-1-02747-trailing-stop-1-0236/">my USD/CHF long</a>, I also placed this NZD/USD short
order last night. Having failed to short this earlier on a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-nzdusd-short-stop-entry-0-7262-exit-trailing-stop-0-7300/">resistance
test of 0.7300</a> using the 4 hour time frame, I'm testing out my daily
method now for shorting at resistance at 0.7380. 0.7380 is an important
resistance for NZD/USD because it marks the breaking point back in July
2008 when NZD/USD started a 6-month long downtrend. Although 0.7500 is
definitely a much stronger and more obvious resistance level, it is a
bit too obvious to wait to shorting it then. I would not short at 0.75
just because it's too obvious to be run down. Furthermore, NZD/USD has
been chugging upward relentlessly. It is deep in overbought territory as
shown by the RSI of Figure 1. Thus, I'm feeling confident enough in this
trade to enter with a full 100% position. Entry: 0.73701 Stop:
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">0.7500</span>, 0.7480
Target: 0.7000 Reward / Risk = 370.1 / 129.9 = 2.8 \&lt; 3. So I'm moving
my stop closer, right at the resistance from the starting point of the
long term drop which started in July 2008. Reward / Risk = 370.1 / 109.9
= 3.4 NZD/USD took a quick dive of about 70 pips within hours of my
entry. So I moved 1/2 of my stop to break-even (net +\$1.81). That tight
stop was taken this evening at the open of the Pacific market, see
Figure 2. I'm left with only a 1/2 position now. Once again, I'm a bit
too hasten to move up my stop. Time will tell if that was a good
decision.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've switched back to using the daily chart as <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-to-lose-focus-by-defining-what-i-want-from-trading/">noted earlier today</a>
to save myself some hassle. This is the first entry using the daily
chart since the switch. But I actually placed this order before going to
bed and then it was executed last night while I was sleeping. USD is
taking a beating these days and USD/CHF is testing a double bottom. I
entered this trade based on Figure 1 for the following 4 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>RSI is shaping up a positive divergence if we can hold this support.</li>
<li>RSI is as oversold as December 2008.</li>
<li>Entry price of 1.027 is at a previous congestion zone based on
    Figure 2.</li>
<li>USD/CHF took a very fast dive in the past 3 days, which usually
    prelude a retracement up.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the trend remains obviously downward. That's why I'm entering
with only a 50% as there's no confirmation just yet. Once there's
confirmation, such as the RSI making a U bottom, I plan to add the other
50% position. Entry: 1.02747, previous congestion zone, see Fig. 2 Stop:
1.0236 Target: 1.045 Reward / Risk = 175.3 / 38.7 = 4.5 > 3</p>

I seem to have taken up too many tasks in recent weeks. I've spent a
couple hours a day analysing, observing, and trading the [forex
market][]. Another hour or so learning RapidMiner 5. And then yet
another couple of hours catching up with the news and various blogs. All
these on top of a full time job! It has come to my attention that I
can't keep this up as I'll be too burned-out and never actually able to
get things done. Such is the bane of choices. Coincidentally, I read
this blog post today (via [TraderFeed][]) about the [paradox of
choices][]. It is basically saying that having choices, per se, can have
a diminishing rate of return (something which I've read elsewhere before
but forgotten). More choices isn't always good and fewer can be better.
And studies have found that the diminishing rate is apparently pretty
low. Here's a good quote from the article:

> "we need to redirect the energies we waste flitting from possibility
> to possibility, into understanding what we really want in life and the
> trade-offs we are willing to make."

Particularly at this early stage of my amateur quant career, there are
many trading tools (analyzer, forecaster, scanner) that I want to
develop and software ([MatLab][], RapidMiner) that I want to learn. So
what do I really want in trading by spending hours upon hours, day after
day, studying, analysing, observing, and thinking? The answer for me is
fortunately easy to find (the benefit of keeping a good written record,
i.e. this blog). Referring to my own [trading objectives][] that I wrote
last year, there is just 5 points.

1.  Application of independent and objective thinking
2.  [Understanding of capital markets][]
3.  Prudent [risk management][]
4.  Identification of [values][]
5.  Study of [quantitative finance][]

In practical terms, **my ultimate goal in trading is to develop a
trading system which requires no more than 1 hour a day of management
time**. That doesn't include research and development time, of course. I
am not trying to develop a holy grail system. I am using the term system
as in a set of processes for me to follow, not an algorithmic system.
Although that would be a tool for my system for sure. Now that I've
figure that out. My first mandate is to reduce my [paper trading][] in
forex. But rather than eliminate it completely, I'm going to increase
the timeframe from 4 hour to daily. Because trading the forex helps me
understand the capital markets (\#2 of objective). Too much of it though
would have been just for thrill and detract from my time for working in
quantitative finance (\#5). If I'm to treat this as a part-time job, I
need to have more discipline in this whole endeavour, not just in the
trading itself.
