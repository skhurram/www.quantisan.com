    </h1>

    <div class='article-content'>
        <p>I've always known that foreign exchange trading is treated as capital
gain tax in Canada. But just to be sure before filing my taxes soon,
I've decided to double check the facts from Canada Revenue Agency. As
you know, the difference between income tax and capital gain tax is
substantial. Income tax is taxed at your marginal tax rate. Whereas
capital gain tax is a generous half of your marginal tax rate. That
works out to a 10% to 20% difference. Taxes in Canada is generally
simple to do. The problem though, is sifting through the cacophony of
information within the Canada Revenue Agency to find out the applicable
rules. I've copy and pasted a couple of relevant excerpts from the 2010
CRA <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/menu/ITSC-e.html">Income Tax Interpretation Bulletin</a> for the record. Basically,
forex trading can be treated as either income or capital gain tax in
Canada (surprise). According to <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it95r/it95r-e.html">IT-95R Foreign exchange gains and
losses</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Where it can be determined that a gain or loss on foreign exchange
arose as a direct consequence of the purchase or sale of goods abroad,
or the rendering of services abroad, and such goods or services are
used in the <strong>business operations</strong> of the taxpayer, such gain or loss
is brought into income account. If, on the other hand, it can be
determined that a gain or loss on foreign exchange arose as a direct
consequence of the<strong>purchase or sale of capital assets</strong>, this gain or
loss is either a capital gain or capital loss, as the case may be.
Generally, the nature of a foreign exchange gain or loss is <strong>not
affected by the length of time</strong> between the date the property is
acquired (or disposed of) and the date upon which payment (or receipt)
is effected.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, it is very vague. That's why forex trading can be
considered income or capital gain tax. It is up to you and your
accountant to figure out which works for you. A noteworthy point in the
above excerpt is that the holding period is not taken into account.
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">So there's no 30-day rule
like in the states whereby frequent trading would miss out the capital
loss credit if they re-purchase the same asset within 30-day of
disposal.</span> Update: Looks like I have misconstrued the above
article with regard to capital loss. As Olga pointed out in the
comments, Chapter 5 of T4037 defines <em>Superficial Loss</em>. In which if you
<em>repurchase</em> your property (e.g. stock) within 30-days after a sale at a
loss, then that initial loss cannot be deducted as a capital loss. More
about the <a href="http://www.wheredoesallmymoneygo.com/superficial-loss-rules-in-canada/">Superficial Loss rules in Canada</a> can be found at
WhereDoesAllMyMoneyGo.com. Further down the page in IT-95R, we have the
following bullet.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A taxpayer who has transactions in foreign currency or foreign
currency futures that do not form part of business operations, or are
merely the result of sundry dispositions of foreign currency by an
individual, will be accorded by the Department the <strong>same treatment as
that of a "speculator" in commodity futures</strong> see 7 and 8 or IT-346R.
However, if such a taxpayer has special "Inside" information
concerning foreign exchange, he will be required to report his gains
and losses on income account.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it346r/it346r-e.html">IT-346R Commodity Futures and Certain Commodities</a> explains the tax
treatment of speculation in the commodity markets.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>As a general rule, it is acceptable for speculators to report all
their gains and losses from transactions in commodity futures or in
commodities as<strong>capital gains and losses</strong> with the result that only
one-half the gain is taxable, and one-half the loss is allowable
subject to certain restrictions, (hereinafter called "capital
treatment") provided such reporting is followed consistently from year
to year.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So there, we have it. Amateur forex traders, such as myself, can report
our forex trading gain/loss as capital gains and losses. The reason
being that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex">forex trading</a> isn't part of my business operation because
I have another primary source of income (e.g. salary from another job).</p>
