    </h1>

    <div class='article-content'>
        <p>This month has been a roller coaster in both the markets and my account
balance (see Figure 1). Here's a quick recap of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trades</a> in
the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex markets</a> for November. I started out by cashing the carried
over long yen and dollar positions from October. Those trades could have
been better as I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-good-trade-that-could-have-been-great-a-lesson-to-take-profit-at-target/">lamented in a post</a>. Nevertheless, it was a
good start for the month. Then, things went downhill for me; literally,
as you can see from my account balance at the first half of the month in
Figure 1. I tried my luck <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-bad-eurusd-day-trading-and-what-to-do-about-it/">day trading EUR/USD with horrible results</a>.
I marked this particular period of drawdown from these EUR/USD day
trades on Figure 1 with a red band. The fear lingered on and I gave up
all the initial gain of the month to scrap just below the opening
balance. Fortunately, I was able to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-example-of-how-trading-in-fear-is-bad-for-your-account/">realize my problem</a> and clean up
my act. I recuperated by documenting <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-0122-sl-1-0060-tp-1-0225/">each</a> <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-audjpy-81-22-sl-80-99-tp-82-50/">of my</a> <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-out-audjpy-longs-81-3-7-pips-and-81-29-28-pips/">entry</a> like I
used to to force myself to think more and trade less. The turnaround
didn't happen immediately. Not until I became even more stringent on
myself and stuck with using only my best setup, the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC setup</a>. I
marked this period on Figure 1 with the green bar and arrow. As you can
see, I happened to be in the right markets and at the right times to
make a full recovery back to the top. In fact, I made <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/audjpy-short-81-3777-17-anatomy-of-my-first-400-pips-trade/">my first 400+
pips trade</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/eurusd-95-pips-in-2-hours-an-example-of-swing-and-day-trade-convergence/">my best EUR/USD day trade</a> during this comeback. I
thought I could finish the month above the critical \$5500 level (10%
gain). But a couple small losers on the last day pulled my account below
it yet again. However, one lesson I became even more aware of from the
draw-down is to forget about your account balance. Focus on making good
trades, manage your risks, and the money will take care of itself.

<h2>Performance Statistics</h2>
<p>Attached below are my performance statistics for November. The first
number is this month's and the second number in bracket is from October
for comparison. I will highlight and comment on the few discrepancies
that I find important. Sarting Fund \$5,089.06 End of Month Fund
\$5,302.21 Total Net Profit \$166.90 (\$213.15) Gross Profit \$598
(\$499) Gross Loss -\$431 (-\$285) Profit Factor 1.39 (1.75) Net Profit
% 3.15% (4.19%) Max. Drawdown % <strong>3.44%</strong> (2.32%) This draw-down is
horrible to say the least. Kurtosis <strong>3.45</strong> (8.53) Skewness <strong>1.54</strong>
(2.49) Sharpe Ratio <strong>16.64</strong> (5.21) The kurtosis and skewness are
surprisingly good. A low, but not near-zero numbers are preferable. The
Sharpe ratio is also surprisingly good too. This isn't because my return
is good, is just that the standard deviation return of my trades have
been very consistent. Ironically, that's mostly because of steady small
losses (see Figure 1). 95th Percentile P&amp;L \$23.20 (\$70.11) 5th
Percentile P&amp;L -\$10.31 (-\$33.60) Net Profit Mid 90% Only <strong>\$33.82</strong>
(\$46.34) I failed to meet <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/october-2009-trading-performance-review/">my goal from last month</a> to increase my
mid-90% return. It would have been easily met if I didn't go crazy with
the day trades and loose a bundle. Total # of Trades <strong>153</strong> (34)
Percent Profitable 47.06% (44.12%) # of Winning Trades 72 (15) # of
Losing Trades 81 (19) I started to make use of scaling in and out of a
trade. So sometimes one trade would be counted as 2 or 3 small ones.
Still, I made too many trades this month. Even if I consider a 2 for 1
ratio of trades (i.e. 153 / 2 = 76), it is still more than twice as many
as last month. My net profit is lower too. Wasted time and effort for
lower return. <strong>Lesson for the month is clearly to think more and trade
less</strong>. Average Trade Profit % 0.02% (0.12%) Average Winning % <strong>0.16</strong>%
( 0.66%) Average Losing % <strong>-0.10</strong>% (-0.30%) Ratio Win% / Loss% 1.57
(2.21) This could be the most worrisome statistics for me this month. My
average winning percentage from a trade is significantly less. <strong>I need
to be more aggressive when I am right to reap the most reward from it</strong>.
Stash in the cash as the position gets greener! Max. Conseq. Winners 12
(4) Max. Conseq. Losers 14 (6) Largest Winning Trade \$41.88 (\$171.79)
Largest Losing Trade -\$20.34 (-\$44.17) Avg. Time Held [hrs] 0.56
(2.18)</p>
<h2>Goal for Next Month</h2>
<p>Let's start by saying what I did well this month. I think my comeback
was phenomenal, but definitely with luck on my side. I approached my
huge draw-down systematically and rationally by reducing position size,
trading less, and restricted myself by using my best <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setup</a>
only. Then when the time was right, I was able to pound on the winning
positions. I will need to remember this the next time I'm experiencing a
draw-down (hopefully not as much as this month's). On the other hand, I
made many trading mistakes this month. Most were just short-term
problems and I have already written about them in my lessons. Upon
further review of my performance this month, two major problems are
evident as discussed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Think more and trade less. Limit my trades to approximately one a
    day and know when to NOT trade at all. Not even with tiny positions
    to "test the water" as I like to do.</li>
<li>Be more aggressive when the position is right. Achieve this by
    improving on my scaling in and out strategy by accelerating the
    scaling in and decelerating on the scaling out.</li>
</ol>
