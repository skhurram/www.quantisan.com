            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I made my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">first RRSP trade to short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) using
puts</a> in April. I also made my first careless mistake in my RRSP by
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-just-made-a-grave-fundamental-mistake-in-my-cve-to-trade/">buying more contracts instead of closing the CVE.TO position</a> as I
intended. As of this writing, I am still holding my puts options as the
slow decline seem to be underway. <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6421BP20100503">China's decision to hike reserve
ratio</a> is also helping by strengthening the dollar and putting another
warning on recent risk appetite. Despite putting my real money on the
line, my main focus lately has been the Dukascopy JForex Strategy
Contest. According to their rankings page, I finished at 4th place for
April's contest. Which means I may receive a USD \$1,000 credit to my
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">trading account at Dukascopy</a>. Even if I were to trade a \$5,000
account as I have done in my paper trading, I couldn't have earned 20%
in a single month <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">based on my past performance</a>. This contest is a
great way for me to fill my forex account with no monetary risk.
Frankly, I was just <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-gamble-or-not-to-gamble/">hoping to squeeze in a top 10</a> because I started
late in the April contest. So I am very happy to finish at such a good
position and receive (hopefully) a decent sum of prize money! For anyone
interested, I have discussed about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/">my winning automated strategy</a>
previously. Feel free to take a look at it to see what got me a 4th
place finish. I will be away on vacation in the last two weeks of May. I
don't expect much to happen with my trading this month as I'm inundated
with personal matters. My primary focus is still the JForex Strategy
Contest. I will be using a new semi-automated strategy this time. My
goal is to finish in the top 6 again.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>There is only two more trading days left in the April <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/">Dukascopy</a>
JForex Strategy Contest. I am currently ranked 6th. But there's a fierce
fight for my spot. I've been moving between 6th and 8th all week even
though I haven't made any trade. The other people are putting on big
bets hoping to squeeze in a top 6. Why? According to the winning prize
structure, the 4th to 6th winners will each receive \$1,000. Whereas the
7th to 10th will each receive \$500 only. With my current account
standing at \$120,032 (20% gain) this month, it is quite viable for
others to try to take my spot. See the table below for the top 10
standings as of this writing.</p>
<p><img alt="April standing 2 days before close" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-29-contestranking.png" /></p>
<p>My options are to either fire up my strategy to make more trades or do
nothing. The risk in running my strategy again is that I might lose
money and make myself even less competitive. My strategy's working
timeframe is in hours, so there isn't much room for error. As such, I
feel that with only two days of trading left, time is not on my side.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I will probably lose out my 6th spot as I am not far
away from others behind me. So if I do nothing, I will most likely end
up 7th or 8th and lose half the prize money.</p>
<p>After pondering about this briefly, I've decided to do nothing. The odds
are just too much against me. I have seen too many people in this
month's contest risking to move up from a good rank only to expose
themselves too much and lose out of the top 10 completely.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I found out that the competing strategy in the Dukascopy JForex Strategy
Contest doesn't need to be 100% automatic! According to <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/forex/jforex/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=4771&amp;sid=2ff0fd1b7645652d5f57821451586b08">Contest Support
in the official forum</a>, I can set parameters like take profit target,
stop loss, and long-only or short-only trades. That make this contest
substantially easier to program as I can implement a semi-automatic
strategy, which is what I prefer in my real trading. The problem with
building an automated trading system is that market conditions change
frequently and without notice. Thus, it takes more than a few lines to
program a consistently profitable system to filter out undesirable
conditions. As I discussed before, because all winners in this contest
have to publish their source codes, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reading-the-fine-print-for-dukascopy-jforex-strategy-contest/">I don't want to spend too much time
on this contest</a>. Now that I know I can trade semi-automatically in
this contest. I can just do my analysis manually and then use the
strategy to execute trades when I so desire. That is exactly like <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-is-your-trading-process/">my
real trading process</a> as illustrated before. As you can imagine, I am
very happy of this news. I don't need to scratch my head anymore to
build a new strategy for next month's contest. I programmed and tested
several new ideas in the past 2 weeks but haven't found anything better
than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/">my existing strategy</a>, which has been doing well in April. This
Dukascopy JForex Strategy Contest has been a great incentive for me to
become familiar with JForex. As I intend to use it for my <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">real trading
at Dukascopy</a> (open an account with this affiliate link to receive 35%
rebate on commissions) later this year, this is a win-win situation for
me as I learn the API and possibly win some prize money at the same
time.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) tested 27.50 support and then bounced back to
break the short-term downtrend line above 28.50 or so, see Figure 1.
Naturally, I don't want to turn a profitable trade into a losing one. So
I wanted to sell <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-10jul17-puts-30-00-mx-2-45-mark-28-64/">my puts options on CVE.TO</a> while I can still exit at
near breakeven. However, as I am new to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> and unfamiliar
with their interface, I made the careless mistake of buying six more
contracts instead of selling the six that I have!</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Cenovus Energy
(CVE.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-23-CVE-TO.png" />][][/caption] I realized my mistake soon afterward from
checking my account. Imagine my surprise to find that I am an owner of
12 puts contracts on CVE.TO. So I wanted to cut my losses immediately.
Unfortunately, the energy sector (XLF) and crude oil just broke above
some key resistances and CVE.TO bumped up a few more points. The right
thing to do is to ignore my unfortunate losses and just exit the
position, as that was what I intended to do. But I didn't. I decided to
not panic and analyze the stock yet another time. CVE.TO is definitely
weak. It is lagging behind others in the sector. Other energy companies
are breaking above resistance levels but CVE.TO is still below its 29.50
resistance. Yet, the fact is that the trend in the sector is upward.
Which is very bad for me. I am still holding this short CVE.TO position
over the weekend as it hasn't broken my 29.50 mental stop yet. I can
give my bearish reasons here upon observing the tape this afternoon
(e.g. Goldman Sachs Canada is dumping shares), but they would just be
excuses under the current circumstances. In any case, this is an
embarrassing confession as I've violated one of the most <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">basic rules of
trading</a>. This position is near breakeven on paper as of the close.
But who knows what can happen over the weekend. Rather than risking 3%,
which is already too much, I am now risking a <em>maximum</em> of 10% on this
trade. What have I done... The high commission in trading options is
affecting my decision. If this were a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex</a> position, I would have
dumped it all without giving it a second thought. This is a sign for me
to stop trading options altogether. It is better to stay with a
long-only equity strategy in my RRSP than get eaten up by commissions or
take excessive risks as I am doing now.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585424331?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=quantisan-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1585424331">Think and Grow Rich</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=quantisan-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1585424331" /> (affiliate) for the third time
last weekend. One of the key ideas presented in the book is to set
realistic long term goal and stick with it every single day. This
reminded me of something that I've done lately which I think is very
helpful in disciplining myself in my trading. That something is this
table below. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-20-monetarygoal.png"><img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-20-monetarygoal.png" /></a> This is a table of my planned deposit and
return for my trading account. The table shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount that I plan to deposit into my trading account each year</li>
<li>the accumulated principal at the end of each year</li>
<li>the expected yield, which is based on my historical trading
    performance from the past 10 years of trading, minus the [couple of
    blowups I've had][] (which is a reason why I am starting from
    scratch in this table)</li>
</ul>
<p>Estimating future values is nothing new. What I find particularly useful
in this table is the fact that they show the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>My minimum savings goal for each year (deposit column). So that I
    can project an annual budget.</li>
<li>Effect of compounding. A reminder that I don't need to perform
    exquisitely in my trading to reach my goal. This helps keep my
    trading expectation realistic and not over-trade.</li>
<li>I can trade for a living after 16 years even with my conservative
    expectations. This is my ultimate goal.</li>
<li>I can update this table at the end of each year with real data so
    that I can see where I stand with respect to my goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a simple and easy to do trading goal visualization. I visualize
this table often to remind myself what I need to do. Both in terms of
setting a bar above to push myself as well as limiting my expectations
to realism. A problem many new traders have, myself included, is the
need to perform, and in a big way (making it big in that one trade), or
conversely, afraid to miss opportunities. This table helps me keep a
realistic mentality just so I don't <em>back up the truck</em> in any
particular trade. As the table clearly shows, I don't need to take
unnecessary risk to reach my goal of trading for a living. What is your
trading goal? What is your plan to achieve it? How do you keep yourself
motivated? These are some fundamental questions that this table can be
helpful in answering.</p>

today (Apr 22). I doubled down on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">my short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO)
position</a> this morning. The price of CVE.TO moved in my favour a day
after my initial short entry. It then bounced back up strongly (about
2.5% rise in a day) yesterday to test \$29.50. However, it has backed
down since. The fact that it didn't touch the \$30 price level is a good
sign. Crude Oil (CL on NYMEX) made a similar move. It tested the 50%
Fibonacci resistance at 84.5 and backed down. This is again a good sign
for my short as it signals the downtrend is a go.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Cenovus Energy
Inc. (CVE.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-21-CVE-TO.png" />][][/caption] However, crude prices became very
choppy in the afternoon today as shown in Figure 2. So perhaps there is
still room to move up. I will keep an eye on the 84.50 and 85.50
resistances for crude and 29.50 and 30.00 for CVE.TO in the coming days.
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="512" caption="Crude
Oil"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-21-CL.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-21-CL.png">1</a>[/caption] A couple of other signs that I watched on
this addition to my short position.</p>
<ol>
<li>this morning, the Bank of Canada gave strong hint that they will
    raise interest rate in June. However, USDCAD made a marginally new
    low briefly and then bounced back up above parity. This is bullish
    for USDCAD.</li>
<li>EnCana earnings topped estimates but the stock dived after the
    opening rush with at least 3 times morning volume as compared to the
    past five days. ECA.TO is hanging on to the 31.5 support level
    before noon but closed above it today. This is not a good sign for
    the energy sector on the TSX.</li>
</ol>
<p>A confirmation with this down move would be a break of the recent low at
\$28 for CVE.TO and \$82 for crude oil.</p>
