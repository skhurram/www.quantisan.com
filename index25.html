            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I don't know if anyone noticed, but in my previous post <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/three-obvious-reasons-to-watch-13000-on-the-tsx/">discussing the
TSX</a>, I included a chart of VIX (S&amp;P500 volatility index) versus S&amp;P
500. VIX is one of the market indicators that I can't live without.
However, as much as the Canadian and the American equity markets are
correlated, they are still separate markets. So using the VIX vs. S&amp;P500
on an analysis of the TSX is like borrowing salt from thy neighbour. But
there's no more need for that soon as TSX is finally getting its own
volatility index starting Monday (October 18)! This is to replace the MX
Implied Volatility Index (MVX) from the Montreal Exchange, which I
didn't have access to previously (aside from <a href="http://www.m-x.ca/indicesmx_mvx_en.php">data published on their
website</a>). One question I have is that the TSX VIX will be based on
TSX 60 index options activity according on their <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3D20101014_TSX-60-VIX_Volatility-Launch.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1243766536405&amp;blobheadervalue3=UTF-8">press release</a>, but
the TSX 60 index options isn't that active. So would the TSX VIX be as
efficient as the S&amp;P500 VIX? An opportunity with the introduction of TSX
VIX on the Toronto Exchange is that I can now place bets on market
volatility in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/ranking-investment-options-for-my-self-directed-rrsp/">self-directed RRSP trading account</a>. Which is
arguably more predictable than the underlying index these days... In any
case, this will be a vital market indicator for Canadian market traders.
For more information on TSX VIX, see the <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-tsx-60-vix/en/us/?indexId=sp-tsx-60-vix">product information page on
Standard &amp; Poor's</a>. And a hat tip to <a href="http://optionmatters.ca/">Option Matters</a> (Montreal

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Talks of QE2 (WSJ: <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/source/2010/10/13/qe2-or-titanic/">QE2 or Titanic</a> and Econbrowser: <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2010/10/why_is_the_fed.html">Why is the Fed
doing this?</a>) and earnings season are pushing the market higher and
higher. Gold is still pushing to new all time high and the dollar is
breaking to new lows. The TSX, in particular, is testing 12,700 today.
13,000 is just around the corner. 13,000 price level is the line in the
sand for the commodity-heavy TSX for three obvious reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>It marks the breakdown support level back in the 2008 crash.</li>
<li>It is the bottom of a prolonged congestion zone in much of 2007 and
    2008 before that crash.</li>
<li>And most importantly, #1 and #2 are very easy to spot on the chart
    (potentially self-fulfilling).</li>
</ol>
<p>It is likely that the TSX will be reaching 13,000 shortly in this
earnings season. However, what happens afterward is anyone's guess. At
this point, I am neither long or short for the long term. The
reward/risk isn't good for going long at this point with that much
uncertainty. And the threat of QE2 and earnings release isn't good for
going short either. I am watching the forex market closely for signs of
a direction as that is a driver of the equity market these days.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've just spent an absurd amount of time figuring out how to parse
millisecond times into R. (It's standard practice to timestamp tick data
with milliseconds timing in a flat data file.) Turns out that there are
two problems that I faced. One being that there is a almost-hidden,
footnote option in the <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/strptime.html">strptime( ) function</a> (for converting
characters to POSIX) in which it describes using <code>format = "%H:%M%OS"</code>
instead of <code>"%H:%M:%S"</code> to parse fractional seconds. However, the second,
and what's actually the one that's wasted much my time, is the fact that
R <strong>ignores</strong> milliseconds in printing by default! For example, here's
an output for the POSIXct representation of the integer value
1286564400.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s">&quot;2010-10-08 15:00:00 EDT&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So even though I figured how to represent millisecond times in R a few
hours ago, I never knew I did it simply because R is not printing the
output that I wanted on screen every time I tried! After a couple hours
of searching, trying, and frustrating, here's the one-liner command that
solved my problem.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">options</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">digits</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">secs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>which changes the options of the display and thus I can see the
following output from the same input as above.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s">&quot;2010-10-08 15:00:00.344 EDT&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I guess that's why they say <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2010/06/learning-r.html">R has a steep learning curve</a>! Yes, it is
very powerful and flexible. But there are limited standards and the
documentations are all over the place because it's a mish mash of
user-contributed packages!</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I ported <a href="http://engineering-returns.com/tsi/">Engineering Return's Trend Strength Index</a> to JForex as my
first practice to writing custom indicators in JForex. Frank's code in
TradeSignal consists of 9 lines. My JForex code? 191. This is my first
custom indicator in JForex. It will also be the last. A compiled
programming language such as Java is not the most convenient to use for
data analysis. The lack of interactivity because of the step of
compilation is one obstacle to fluent data explorations. Secondly, the
language itself is more cumbersome because of its generality. Java is
used to build all sorts of applications. Contrary to something like
MatLab, in which it is purposely built to work with numbers. I miss <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/starting-to-use-matlab-for-quantitative-finance/">the
days when I have my license for MatLab</a>. However, being forced away
from MatLab might not be a bad thing. As much as I've become accustomed
to it, MatLab isn't without its flaws. But I won't bash it in this post.
What I actually want to talk about is R. The rage these days in
statistical data analysis is in R (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29">Wiki entry on R</a>). I've done
some research and testing, R is really as good as they say it is (see
past publications in <a href="http://www.rinfinance.com/">R/Finance conference</a><a href="http://probability.ca/cran/doc/contrib/Farnsworth-EconometricsInR.pdf"></a>). You will get to see
some real examples in financial time series data analysis in R later in
this blog once I have some publishable results. This will no doubt take
some time as I am learning yet another new programming language (thus
the lack of posts this week). The plan from now on is to use R to play
with the data. Then once the algorithm is finalized, I will either port
it to Java (JForex) for deployment or <a href="http://www.rforge.net/rJava/">embed the R environment in
Java</a> for live trading.</p> </div>
