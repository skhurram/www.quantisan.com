\$8.60 last week while I was away. So I am not taking any chance for
this position to go negative. The net gain in this is \$25 after \$10
commission, which is essentially breakeven from my [\$7.25 purchase
price a couple of weeks ago][]. Looking at the daily chart of Figure 2,
it seems that natural gas is in consolidation mode. I will be watching
the channel as drawn on Figure 2 for another chance to short it via
HND.TO later. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am shorting Natural Gas via the Horizons 2x leveraged bearish ETF
(HND.TO). The U.S. Energy Information Association (EIA) released their
<a href="http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html">weekly natural gas storage report</a> yesterday. The underground storage
amount is only 4.9% above last year's level. However, as <a href="http://shockedinvestor.blogspot.com/2010/05/why-natural-gas-should-be-shorted-or.html">Shocked
Investor points out</a>, last year's amount was a record high. So 4.9%
above last year's is even higher. Figure 1 shows the two year graph of
natural gas storage and the 5-year avearge channel. [caption id=""

futures was testing \$4.50 resistance yesterday (Figure 2) within a
prolonged downtrend. As such, both fundamental and technical shows
bearishness. So I shorted natural gas with HND.TO today on retracement
to \$7.25 support (Figure 3). This retracement is due to HND meeting
resistance at \$7.50 (50% Fibonacci level on the \$8 to \$7 drop this
week).</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been watching CIBC (CM.TO) for a few months now. CM finally
presented a shorting opportunity that I took today. Figure 1 speaks for
itself. Furthermore, the lackluster rally in EUR/USD after the ECB's
vouch for confidence is encouraging for the bears.</p>

<p>\$74.00 - \$74.50 is a strong resistance for CM. There are three
scenarios in which this trade can play out. CM can go up, go down, or
move sideway. If CM move upward, I will watch the push above \$74.50. My
current exit stop is at \$75.00 (about \$1 on the premium). However, as
this is an options position. There is a time decay factor working
against me. As such, I will decrease my exit stop by \$1.00 on the share
price every month to compensate. For example, by mid-June, my exit stop
is \$74.00 on the underlying share price of CM. If CM move downward, I
will move my stop to breakeven if it breaks below \$72. If CM move
sideway, I will give it a month's time. If CM just consolidates around
\$74, I will exit by late June for a loss of \$1 (\$300 total) on the
premium. My targets are \$70, \$68, and \$65 as shown on Figure 1. I
will tighten my stop passing each support level. My ideal loss is \$300
at most. That represents 3.4% of my total account on this trade.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I wrote last Friday, I took a long position in Teck Resources
(TCK-B.TO) at \$36.03 but got <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-110-tck-b-to-36-03-stopped-out-at-breakeven/">stopped out at breakeven</a>. In
hindsight, the retracement after testing the \$37 resistance held the
50% level near the close. That was a bullish sign that I missed at the
time and only realized during my weekend review. As you know, the TSX
market gapped about 2% up and S&amp;P gapped about 4% up right at the open.
The market traded in a range all day but managed to hold the gap.
However, EUR/USD closed its gap and is testing 1.27 support as I write
this. The EUR/USD pair will be an important pair to watch as the
European Union drama unfolds. With regard to TCK, Figure 1 speaks for
itself. It gapped up about 8% and closed up 8.78% at \$39.53. I decided
not to chase the market early on today as the reward/risk ratio just
isn't as appealing anymore. There are always opportunities sailing
around the corner. So there is no need to go out of breath chasing that
one missed boat.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I typed a rather long reply on the SMB Training blog to <a href="http://www.smbtraining.com/blog/traders-ask-how-much-capital-do-i-need-to-trade">the question of
how much capital one needs to start trading</a>. So I thought I might as
well expand on this frequently asked question for traders visiting here.
Here is my process. The first thing to realize is the fact that trading
is a business. And like any business, the single most important question
to ask is -- what is your bottom line? That can be simplified to two
parts. What do you expect to make and what are your costs? Let's
consider your expectation first. You can't estimate your expectation if
you don't know what you did (that would be a haphazard guess). When I
dipped my hands in trading forex the first time. I started by paper
trading a demo account for a few months. As I was unfamiliar with
trading forex, that provided me with a risk-free opportunity to learn.
Equally more importantly, it serves as a Monte Carlo experiment (perhaps
more on this another time) to figure out my expected performance
statistics in this particular market (for example, here's my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">January
2010 review</a>). That is how you can scientifically derive your trading
expectation. Based on history. Yes, past performance is no guarantee of
future return. But at least it should give you a ballpark figure. So
unless someone can suggest a better method, you need to seriously grind
it out on a demo account first. (I only said this is straightforward. I
didn't say this is easy.) Fortunately, that is the hard part. Next step
to figuring out your costs is easy. Just calculate your trading
commission, data fees, etc. Then estimate how much fees you are paying
per trade. This is the cost basis of your trading. Then here are the
steps for calculating your initial capital need.</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate your average return percentage (of total principle) per
    trade from your paper trading.</li>
<li>Make an educated guess on your capital need, just to initialize the
    numerical process.</li>
<li>Calculate how much average amount of money you expect to make per
    trade using #1 and #2.</li>
<li>Divide your cost basis per trade with #3 to get a percentage of
    cost per trade.</li>
<li>Reiterate steps #2 to #4 until your percentage of cost per trade
    is acceptable. i.e. increase your capital (#2) if your percentage
    of cost is too high, and vice versa.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, say you expect to make an average +1% of your total account
per trade (step #1). Then let's say you thought an \$10,000 account is
enough (#2). \$10,000 x 0.01 = \$100. So you can expect to make an
average of \$100 per trade (#3). And let's say your fees is \$5 per
trade. A round-trip (buy and sell) would cost you \$5 x 2 = \$10. Thus,
#4 is found by \$10 / \$100 = 10%. Which means you'll be set back by
10% on every single trade. That cost percentage is too high. Then let's
double the capital to \$20,000 and go through steps #2 to #4 again.
Assuming your fees per trade is fixed, which is most likely for small
accounts. You'll find that your cost percentage is 5% for a \$20,000
account based on the same conditions. Perhaps 5% is acceptable for you?
If not, raise your capital estimate again and re-do the calculations (a
spreadsheet would be useful). The process is straightforward and
unambiguous. Once you've done your paper trading, the actual calculation
should take less time to do than reading this post.</p>
