            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Friday's strong rally with some volume seem to be following through as
of this morning. However, last Friday was options expiration day. So a
good proportion of that volume is expected to be due to that.
Additionally, the Asian market was down, except Japan and Australia,
last night. This is not a good sign. Hong Kong (-1.59%), Shanghai
(-3.67%), and Japan (+2.70%). This isn't good because it shows the world
players are not putting in their vote of confidence in this rally.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the hourly e-mini S&amp;P500 still haven't broken its downtrend
resistance from 11/04. I would like to see it breaks 814 and remain
above 803 as a confirmation to this rally. If ES can break 814/820, then
840 is just an earshot away and would be my first target. If it breaks
below 803, then 790 is the first target and then further breaking 780
would be diastrous.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_872" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>On a positive note, the US Dollar Index finally broke 87.50 as I was
waiting last Friday. This is a short term support level and a downtrend
in US Dollar is a good sign for the rally. This suggest that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/pre-market-analysis-for-november-21-2008/">sideline
money are moving into the US market</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, precious metals remain the best performers since last week. Gold
is still moving up with good momentum. ZG is now up 24.50 overnight to
816.20. The major 800 resistance didn't held it for long. If we can stay
above this 800 level, then this is a great sign of the strength to come
for Gold. Otherwise, breaking 800 to 793 or so is expected as a
retracement. Just so as long as Gold doesn't break 780, this precious
metals rally is still good.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been trying to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/?s=bottom">catch falling knives</a> for a few weeks now.
Every time I think we're at a bottom, the market rally a bit to get my
hopes up and then continue to drift down more. In retrospect, there are
so many trading no-no's I have broken with that dangerous mentality. My
account is down significantly as of this writing and I have learned many
old and new lessons throughout these weeks. In fact, I have demonstrated
improving trading <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">technique</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1190/">psychology</a> even as I was losing
money overall (what an oxymoron). Rather I'm trying to comfort myself or
not, the fact is that losing money is simply unacceptable in trading. So
I will review these trades in this post and perhaps learn something from
them.</p>
<p>As the title suggest, this is a post for post-hoc analysis of the
options which I held into expiry (3 losing and 1 winning). I'll do this
chronologically. The longest Nov09 position I have is SLW Nov 2.5 Call.
I have been a big fan of SLW as I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written and traded SLW numerous
times</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, I've annoted my charts
more than usual and will show more and write less in this post. I noted
my entry point in each trade, and labelled the stop and post-hoc <strong>ideal
exit/stop points</strong>.</p>

<p>My effective <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">entry point in my SLW Nov 2.5 Calls</a> were at SLW share
price of \$2.90 (SLW closed at \$2.81 Friday). I bought 2 Calls for
\$0.55 and at expiry, they are worth \$0.325. A loss of \$45 + \$15 for
commission as of this writing. I held on to my 2.5 calls and exercised
them, so +200 shares of SLW for me.</p>
<p>Next up is ABB on the same day. The share price for ABB was at \$10.31
when I entered. ABB closed Friday at \$9.95. I bougt the three ABB Nov
10 Calls for \$0.90. They are worth \$0.05 each. A total loss of \$255 +
\$15 for commission.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_858" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>Then we have TCK entered at TCK share price of \$5.575. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-tck-100-nov-08-5-call-100/">bought two
TCK Nov 5 Calls for \$1.00</a> each and they are now worthless. A
complete wipeout of \$200 + \$15 commission.</p>

<p>Lastly, there's this puny winning day trade in the last 40 minute of
Friday. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/">bought a UYG Nov 3 Call for \$0.55</a> and it expired for
\$0.95. A profit of \$40 - \$15 comission, so a total of +\$25 so far. I
held on to this call and exercised it. I have +100 shares of UYG to
carry over the weekend.</p>

<p>As you can see, <strong>if only I have used trailing stops, I could have held
onto some of the profits and not turn winning trades into a losing
ones</strong>. I didn't want to let the large swing in premiums stop me out
from a big rally. That's why I didn't use trailing stop. However, the
lack of subsequent follow-through and confirmation in the rally should
have been a glaring alarm sign. I should have put in trailing stops from
this lack of strength in the rally. <strong>Any counter-trend position should
be carefully managed with tighter than usual risk management</strong>.</p>
<p>I have let my <em>undying hope for a rally</em> clouded my judgement. This
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/move-from-certainty-to-curiosity-to-improve-your-trading/">stubborn need to be right</a> is a very fundamental psychological flaw
in trading. If I can't stop doing that in the future, I might as well
quit trading manually and focus on developing my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative financial
engineering</a> work. However, as I have noted, I think I'm improving
lately and upon further reflection, I believe I have come up with a
potential methodology to correct myself in the act ... More on this as I
develop on this technique.</p>

<p>Just a cheap shot in the final 45 minutes of this option expiration
Friday. S&amp;P has shot up to 775 and retraced a little. The
Advance-Decline line has turned up and the TICK is strong during this
retracement. This looks like a strong setup to rally into the close.
Let's see if the market can do it. Otherwise, there goes \$62.50 into
the drain.</p>

<p>Citigroup is all over the news today. NYT:<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/business/21finance.html?ref=business">Citigroup Tries to Stop the
Drop in Its Share Price</a> and FT:<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c5cd6378-b7fe-11dd-ac6d-0000779fd18c.html">Citi board locked in talks as shares
dive</a>.</p>
<p>After failing to retake \$10 earlier in the week, C share price has gone
vertical. Since Citigroup is in-play in the market this week, this is a
great time to buy an options <a href="http://www.theoptionsguide.com/long-strangle.aspx">strangle</a> to capitalize on this
volatility. The bet here is that Citigroup would go down in flames or it
would rise back from the dead. This position will breakeven if C goes
below \$0.88 or above \$6.62. Given that C was at \$10 just days ago,
moving from \$3.44 as of now to beyond either of those range seems
viable.</p>
<p>Upside: Lots of talk about C at the moment. The stock is in-play. High
volatility is what the options strangle feed off by.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$5, we could bounce around the \$5 range</p>
<p>Downside: High volatility so options premium is expensive. The
volatility might be factored in the price already, so this \$0.88 to
\$6.62 range could be a trading range for C until expiry next month.</p>
<p>Support: errr... \$0?</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is a hedged play. I can profit if C goes up or down.
Given the extent of the situation with Citigroup, I think it's highly
likely we would break this range.</p>

<p>The possible folding of Citigroup is creating another wave of panic on
the market today. As the second biggest bank in America, this is unlike
the collapse of Lehman, WaMu, Fannie and Freddie. While the previous
institutions are also gigantic financial institutions and an integral
part of the financial system, Citigroup is different because it's a part
of the daily lives of many Americans. While I am not an economist, but I
am a consumer. I <em>personally</em> feel this is psychologically a bigger
deal.</p>
<p>However, is this a time to panic? Perhaps. But from a trader's
standpoint, I think we would be a little too late now. In hindsight,
anyone would have wished to unload the financials back in 2007. But who
am I kidding, I definitely don't have that foresight.</p>
<p>What I do notice though, is that the failed retest of \$10 for C last
Friday and this Monday was a pretty good sign that C is going down. A
failed retest of the \$8.5 level on Tuesday and Wednesday was a
confirmation. I tried to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-325/">short C</a> then but was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-350/">stopped out</a>.
Frankly, I didn't think it would be <em>this</em> bad (my target was \$7).</p>
<p>Since then, Citigroup and the market continued to decline at an
accelerated pace. Rather this is simply a case of correlation or
causality is unknown by me. It doesn't matter. The point is, even an
amateur like me saw C to be going down on Wednesday. Do you think the
professionals would have missed it? Wouldn't they know already C would
be <em>going down in flames</em>? And probably months ago too!</p>
<p>I think it's good to assume that the current panic on Citigroup trading
below the magical \$5 has been factored in the market already. So am I
saying we'll be making a reversal soon? Not really. C trading below \$5
is one thing, but there's also the bigger picture we should consider.
Would this trigger a new leg of this bear run due to a vicious spiral of
panic? Don't forget, we have recently <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-breakdown-of-a-major-multi-year-support-are-we-going-down-and-i-mean-really-down/">broken some multi-year
supports</a>. This leg of the market downturn <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/pre-market-analysis-for-november-21-2008/">still haven't eased off
yet</a>.</p>
<p>Yes we may be going down, but I believe the time for panic was over,
this is a time for finding values and positioning yourself for the
longer term (hey, it has to go up <em>some</em> time, right?). I wouldn't dare
short this market though, even a target of 600 on the S&amp;P is just 150
points away, but look at the S&amp;P chart on any time frame and you can see
the vast green pasture to the upside. The risk/reward potential just
isn't that good for a short here.</p>
<p>I believe I have learned my lesson. There is no profit in calling for
bottoms. I will wait for the market to play it out and watch the price
action for entries.</p>

<p>I have covered my FSLR Jan09 70 put as planned. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1320/">shorted it for
\$13.2</a> and covered it for \$11.90. An overnight profit of \$130 after
commission. The share price was about \$92 at the time of this trade. It
is now at \$88 as I type a few minutes later. I covered at a good time,
right at the peak of this morning gap up rush. Frankly, I'm just glad I
can cover it at a profit. I would have done the same even if it's a
loss. Better be small than big.</p>
<p>I believe my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1320/">original reasons for going long</a>
were sound for the <em>long</em> term, but I obtusely forget the fact that I
can't stand a huge potential drawdown. I am clearly still suffering from
this bottom-calling tendency. But at least I caught myself this time. I
think this is a good start to correct this costly habit.</p>
<p>Looking at the trend in this week's down leg indicate we can have a
downside to \$80 for ESLR. Entering long at yeseterday was a low
probability trade. I should have waited til \$80 or better yet, wait for
a confirmation for a rally.</p>
