caption="CAF"][<img alt="CAF" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/2008-10-01-caf.png?w=500" title="2008-10-01-caf" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>This is suppose to be another of my GTC limit order before leaving to
Taiwan. I've set the buy order at \$25.0 on 25th. I got back on the 30th
(29th EST) and CAF looked strong. So I wanted to replace my \$25 bid to
\$26... However, I wasn't careful and the trading platform changed the
limit price to the market ask without me realizing until I placed the
order. Of course, then the order was filled and I got in at \$28.89,
higher than I would have wanted. I thought of exiting the position
immediately, at a small lost, but decided against it because I felt CAF
is going strong. I didn't need to pick the bottom and I was never good
at that anway. So I chose to stick with this entry.</p>
<p>But what do ya know, that afternoon, the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aJY4KBvL.dRE&amp;refer=home">US House decided to reject the
\$700-billion rescue plan</a>. DJIA tanked 777 points that day and the
financials were hit the hardest of course. My \$26 bid would have seemed
like an ingeneous entry as CAF hit a low of \$25.11 that day. However, I
wouldn't have guessed that.</p>
<p>Given the high amount of volume at the low and near the end of the
trading day, I doubt we will see that price any time soon for CAF. \$25
is definitely a strong support.</p>
<p>Upside: Daily chart still looks good. Financials are in severe panic
mode.</p>
<p>Resistance: A downward trendline is capping recent highs. \$30 round
number looks like the high end of trading range.</p>
<p>Downside: Possible turn to bearish from indicators. Financials earnings
coming soon, the numbers aren't gonna be pretty.</p>
<p>Support: \$26 looks like the bottom of the trading range we're in now.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: CAF has weathered the Dow 777 day drop with style. It has
shown strength at the worst of times. However, don't expect a steady
climb from here. At this market's condition, anything is possible (i.e.
more panic days in the coming weeks and CAF would be thrown out along
with the financials again). I don't think this is to be a buy and hold
position yet. So watch for breakouts either way and be ready to trade in
and out.</p>
<p>On another note, if I have more funds, I'd rather be scaling in CAF on
the lows for the long term instead of swing trading for a few bucks.</p>

<p>Just before leaving for Taiwan on the 25th, I placed a GTC limit order
buy for SLW at \$8.80. The order executed on September 29th, 9:32am, at
the open. I can't remember the exact reasons for the \$8.80 price point.
I should post an entry when I do limit orders from now on just to be
clear.</p>

<p>However, looking at the charts of SLW and Silver (YI), things are
looking bearish for SLW. I will watch this position and be ready to exit
as soon as needed or on a small bounce. It's funny that what I believe
to be my most "stable" company turned out to be the one I'm worrying
about in my current holdings. I guess that's a good sign as I'm not too
attached to any company or having too much faith in them. <strong>Being
skeptical and remaining critical of your positions are what's essential
in trading</strong>.</p>
<p>Fee \$5</p>
<p>Upside: Still haven't touched the 50 dma. Price is in trading range near
the 52-week low.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$9.0, then 10.</p>
<p>Downside: Indicators seem to be turning bearish.</p>
<p>Support: Round number \$8.0, although the current price is already
skimming on it. More likely \$7.50, just below the all time low of
\$7.62</p>
<p>Bottom line: My signals have turned negative on SLW. I will try to get a
good exit.</p>

<p>In recent years, I've started to like Dell computers more and more.
Their laptops has been well priced and quality built (I don't have much
experience with their other products). Their recent introduction of the
Dell Mini 9, for example, shows great management on many levels. It is a
solid product that addresses the competitors' problems, at a competitive
price, and timed well for an entry when netbook is starting to prove to
be more than just a fad with real market potentials.</p>
<p>Dell is a company I'd like to hold for the long term just because I like
them so much.</p>
<p>Upside: PE at 12.32. Indicators buy setup, see daily graph. Michael Dell
bought \$100 million worth of shares above \$20 on Sept 4/5.</p>
<p>Resistance: Sept 19 high of around \$18.50</p>
<p>Downside: Recession, low demand, stiffer competitions. Taiwanese
computer manufacturers like Asus, Acer, and MSI are stepping into Dell's
territory.</p>
<p>Support: Sept 19 low of \$15.50</p>
<p>Bottom line: Just like their products, I feel that DELL offers real
value.</p>
<p>Target: 50 dma of \$22</p>
<p>Stop: \$15.00</p>

<p>Sold my SKF from a cost basis of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bot-11-skf-10260/">\$102.60 from yesterday</a> (fee \$5).
The ETF still seem poised to go higher in the near term. However, since
I'll be off to Taiwan for a few days, I don't want to leave the position
unattended as it is highly volatile. Ideally, I'd like to wait for the
price to reach at least \$110 or later in the week to sell it. Still, I
am satisfied with my small gain and would not risk more for a little
gain (I considered placing a limit sell at \$110).</p>
<p>I still believe SKF has a lot of potential for a much higher price in
the coming weeks to about > \$120 based on the fundamentals (i.e. the
<a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/09/i-got-75b-but-i.html">laughable spin by the media on Buffett's deal with Goldman Sach</a>) and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bot-10-skf-9670/">technicals</a>.</p>
