went to bed. I was too tired and found that I wasn't concentrating. My
brain was definitely off already.</p>
<p>I seriously considered entering a long at about the vertical line. Then
after watching it for a few bars, the price seems to be stuck in a
trading range, so it could go either way. Since I didn't want to wait
for long because I almost fell asleep at the table, I decided to not
enter a position. It was a good decision because the price would have
went below my stop (lowest of past few bars in the trading range) before
rising just a 6 index points, and with a lot of struggle too.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day, there were a lot of choppiness and not a lot of
big swings. It would have been better to stay off the market because my
stops would have been killed.</p>
<p>Although I didn't make any profit for the day, I didn't lose any either.
So I think going to bed early last because I wasn't up for it was a wise
decision.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The 3 trade max. rule is working well tonight. I was more patient to
wait for the right moment. I almost entered my 4th trade but didn't
because I wanted to stick to my rule, at least for the first day.
Luckily, that would have been another losing trade.</p>
<p>I think I'm finally learning that it's not worth it to get into small
moves. The reward/risk ratio is usually not good. And those are usually
the emotional trades too, where I somehow convinced myself the price is
going to move that way. [<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6yCfxzQQ1I/AAAAAAAAANs/jIfly4pLVqg/s400/er2_rpt.jpg" />][]</p>

I entered a short but got stopped out on a quick bump. Then I
immediately got back in once I see the stochastic is doing down and the
price is topping on the fast time period.</p>
<p>This turned out to be a good decision as I rode it down 5 points. I
thought the drop could reach the lower Keltner at first. But from
watching the action, the move seemed to be testing the 50 EMA and
failing to punch through. In addition, I expected there wouldn't be much
volatiliy today because the last 2 sessions had large swings and there
didn't much going on in the fundamental side today (no news). So I
exited while I could. That wasn't the bottom but was close enough
because after a bit of struggle in a tight range, the price did bounce
back up to the day's high. I should have waited a bit more when the
signs were more clear. I think I was just lucky that I exited near the
bottom. It could have easily been a consolidation and then tanked
further.</p>
<p>The proper exit point is when on the fast time period, the price stayed
in a zone for longer than the previous resistance level and the
intermediate time frame showed the hammer formation. Remember, if I
enter on a time frame, use the same time frame for exit. It would have
been a less profitable trade in this case, but the price could have went
further.</p>

two weeks in Canada. I could blame it on the fact that I'm not used to
trading at night and that I was very tired also because of jet lag.
However, I shouldn't have traded at all if I knew that I wasn't in good
condition.</p>
<p>Perhaps the thinking that caused me to trade so many times is that I
didn't want to miss any opportunities. I move in too fast before the
signals are mature. Thus, one thing I need to do is don't guess where
the market is moving. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Let the signals
mature and the price to move a bit first before entering; I don't have
to get in and out at exactly the top and bottom of a swing</span>.</p>
<p>For the moment, I am imposing a 3 trades maximum rule to restrain myself
until I'm producing better results and am more disciplined.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6I-lhzQQtI/AAAAAAAAAMs/e3JJNFik3BA/s400/er2_trade.jpg" />][]I'm starting a trade of the day series in addition to my daily
day trading report. This is to highlight a particular good or bad trade
of the day where I think it's worth documenting.</p>
<p>In this trade, both my CCI and Kelterner indicated a sell. So a double
confirmation. So I waited for an entry by looking at my fast time frame.
On the fast time frame, the price has been in Stochastic overbought zone
for like 20 bars. Then a double top came outside of Keltner at price
\$699.60, which is just below the \$700 resistance. So I entered a short
near the top, which made a triple top and placed a stop just above
\$700.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, it broke through \$700. Not good. It seemed to me
like the MM are eating up the stops. So I moved my stop up above \$701.
I was quite certain that the price is going down...</p>
<p>After just passing \$701, the price started to go down as expected.
However, it was more like drifting down and coiling up rather than a
fast breakdown. The stochastic was choppy too. So I wasn't so sure
anymore and decided it's better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>I exited my position at \$699.50 (local low wa \$698.60) when the
Stochastic was going out of the oversold zone. Soon afterward, the price
continued on its run for the day. I was very fortunate to have at least
made back the comissions.</p>
<p>Lessons from this trade:</p>
<ol>
<li>Placing stops just above weak support/resistance could easily get
    taken out.</li>
<li>If the price
    <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">hasn't
    moved</span> as intended, then re-evaluate the position and cut
    loses if things don't look good. There's always another chance.</li>
</ol>

had a good day today and covered my losses from yesterday. Good days
always seem to come after a bad day. I think it's probably because I'm
more calm after a losing day. So now, I just need to maintain my
composure even if I'm up.</p>
<p>MBIA had a conference call today and told everyone everything's still
good even though they are reporting a \$2.3bln loss last quarter! Go
figure! Someone at BillCara is suggesting that the fund managers are
proping the market because it's the last day of the month. Just so they
can have a positive January.</p>
<p>I traded the pre-market signal as intended and it paid off. The gap
closed as expected but I <span style="font-weight:bold;">exited too
early</span> again. If only I held longer, my profits would have been in
the 4 figures today.</p>
<p>I did well today, entering trades only when the risk/reward ratio is
deemed worthwhile. In addition, I am making use of resistance and
support levels. I think this helped a lot.</p>
<p>However, I think I need to be quicker on my decision. I found that many
times, I was still pondering should I enter and then the price have
moved already. On the other hand, my exit trigger is a bit too fast
because I'm still not letting my profit run. Thus, I think I need to
automate some of my decision making process (like adding some ShowMe's)
rather than just eyeballing my indicators. One idea I'm having is tune
my fast time period with an appropriate ShowMe. This should be something
simple. I am thinking of implementing a ShowMe for local high/low with
stochastic divergence as setup.</p>
