            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Good news is, the e-mini S&amp;P futures has moved up overnight. Bad news
is, it's still resting on the lower end of a slightly up trend from
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-recollection-of-my-analysis-for-buying-when-sp-broke-down-to-820-today/">last Thursday's 95 point rally</a>. For a confirmed follow through, we
need to at least break above the 870 level during market hours. If S&amp;P
do break above 870, then my target is 920 and possibly 940, the upper
range of this uptrend. However, and it looks like a distinct possibility
from here, if we break below 845 / 836 (200 bma) today, then 800 is an
obvious target. Breaking below 800 would mean 770 is in the works. A
bear trap / bull shakeout could also occur at the 820 level, that would
be the line in the sand for a rally or breakdown for the intermediate
term.</p>

<p>US Dollar Index is in a slow downtrend as we speak. We could retrace to
87.20 and then head back down to 85.70. Breaking below 85.70 without
retracement would be a strong sign of this breakdown. Moving above 87.0
at this point would be signs of strength. So I would watch the action
above 87.0 and below 86.0 today.</p>

<p>Lastly, gold is still in a strong uptrend. Breaking below 795 would
signal caution to a big retracement or even a downturn. Otherwise, a
steady rise from here would be healthy. Breaking above 820 and taking
out yesterday's high of 831 could become explosive to the upside.</p>

<p>It's interesting to see all three of these markets trading in a
textbook-perfect range. It's difficult to tell rather we'll move up or
down in the S&amp;P at the moment. If we are stuck in a trading range today,
which I think is the most likely to happen, then I'll be looking down
below.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I sold 120 of my 366 shares of SLW just before 3pm today. I still have
246 shares. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-166-slw882-limit/">purchased 166 SLW shares way back before the crash</a> on
October 1 for ... gasp ... \$8.82. I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written about SLW</a> numerous
times and have swing traded options to make up for some of the loss
throughout these couple of months.</p>
<p>What prompted me to sell some SLW today is that Silver is up over \$1.0
to 10.487 yet SLW failed to hold on to its morning gain, see Figure 1
below. The line in the sand for me was the \$3.1 level as shown in the
hourly chart in Figure 2. Then later in the day, it failed to recapture
the \$3.0 level. I got out at \$2.90 as noted.</p>
<p>This dichotomy of rising silver price and falling SLW price shows
weakness on SLW's part. I'd like to think this is a good trade because I
had a plan and followed it. I have let my SLW shares lost 2/3 of its
value already. I am not going to let my bullish precious metal sentimet
affect my SLW trades like before.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>S&amp;P is up 50+ points today. We gapped up at the open, stayed in a
trading range for the day, then slowly rose up in the last hour, but
only to lose a small chunk and settled at 850, again. The volume has
been low throughout the day and the internals didn't look too good.
That's what prompted me to unload about half my positions in the last 45
minutes. The recent beating in my account certainly is making me being
very cautious now. I'd rather <strong>save my ammo to enter higher later when
we get confirmation for a rally than wait for one with bloated bullish
positions</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at the S&amp;P 500, TICK, and Advance-Decline line. Aside from the
open gap up peak, both the TICK and A-D line failed to impress
throughout the day. Actually, it was lack of strength in the numerous
840 tests and the weak 850 breakout about 3:20 that worried me. Notice
the lower lows in both the TICK and A-D line at the 840 and 850
breakouts in the chart below.</p>

<p>The first to go was -90 DELL @ 9.90 at 3:25pm for about a 50% loss. I
[bought DELL at the beginning of October for \$16.49][] and it has been
underperforming throughout the two months. There's been little volume
since I bought, up or down. Even with the exuberant buying on the market
today, DELL failed to break above \$10 (it did close at \$10.14). Most
important reason for me selling this long term holding now is that
there's very little volume even on this up day when everyone's expecting
a real bear rally.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_887" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>Next up, I sold my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">C calls from the strangle placed Friday</a>. As I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-uyg-449/">said earlier in the day</a>, the news that the FED is bailing out
Citigroup has rocketed its share price from \$3.17 at my time of
purchase to \$6.50 on the morning rush. However, C share price eased
down throughout the day and failed to break \$6 with high volume. I sold
at about \$6.05. I purchased the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">+2 Dec 5 calls for \$0.79</a> and sold them for \$1.77. This was a
speculative play and I didn't want to be greedy. So I sold when C share
price showed it's lacking steam to continue to move up ahead.</p>

<p>Lastly, I sold my [+2 ABB Dec 10 calls purchased at \$1.55][] for
\$1.70. A breakeven trade after commission. The drawdown was humongous
in this trade since I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/">missed some previous stops</a>. The ABB share
price action is a lot like DELL today, a lot of fireworks but no real
substance. Yes, the price is up a lot today, but there's no volume from
it. In particular, in the last 15 minute, ABB dived back down to its
major pivot point of \$11.10. I quickly unloaded my calls then.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_889" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>Like everyone else, I am really hoping for a good bear rally. It would
do everyone, both bears and bulls, some good at this point. The thinking
is, after so many fake rallies lately, this one has to be it, right?
However, having learned my lesson in bottom picking in this bear market,
I'm putting my hope/logic aside and interpret what I see in front of me.
From today's price and volume movement, this rally doesn't seem like it
will follow through.</p>
<p>I do hope I'm wrong though, if we can hold the 845/840 level on the
S&amp;P500 tomorrow. Then I would be looking to add to my already 60% long
holdings.</p>

<p>I sold my 100 shares of UYG because it was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/">bought on margin last
Friday</a> when the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/">call option was exercised</a>. The effective share
price I bought was \$3.55. I sold it for \$4.49 today. A profit of \$94
- (\$7.5[option fee]+\$15[exercise fee]+\$5[stock fee]) commission.
Clearly, the commission made this trade a bad one. I didn't know TOS
charge me \$15 for exercising options.</p>
<p>I sold at \$4.50 because it's a resistance level and we tested it a
couple times this morning without breaking it. Although the risk/reward
at \$4.50 still remains favourable, I sold because I don't want to use
margin money. As of this writing, UYG has broken \$4.50 to \$4.67. I
believe \$5.00 is a good target and possible \$5.7 in the near term.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I still have my trump card in the financials. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">C options
strangle</a> is doing quite well now that the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122753629931853007.html">government is pumping
money into Citigroup</a>.</p>
<p>Update: After writing a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/">big piece on trailing stop</a> yesterday, I totally forgot to apply it myself. I really
should have used a trailing stop in this case since I thought \$4.40 was
a good stop. UYG is now trading at \$4.85 without much drawdown. At
least this is a small position.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Friday's strong rally with some volume seem to be following through as
of this morning. However, last Friday was options expiration day. So a
good proportion of that volume is expected to be due to that.
Additionally, the Asian market was down, except Japan and Australia,
last night. This is not a good sign. Hong Kong (-1.59%), Shanghai
(-3.67%), and Japan (+2.70%). This isn't good because it shows the world
players are not putting in their vote of confidence in this rally.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the hourly e-mini S&amp;P500 still haven't broken its downtrend
resistance from 11/04. I would like to see it breaks 814 and remain
above 803 as a confirmation to this rally. If ES can break 814/820, then
840 is just an earshot away and would be my first target. If it breaks
below 803, then 790 is the first target and then further breaking 780
would be diastrous.</p>

<p>On a positive note, the US Dollar Index finally broke 87.50 as I was
waiting last Friday. This is a short term support level and a downtrend
in US Dollar is a good sign for the rally. This suggest that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/pre-market-analysis-for-november-21-2008/">sideline
money are moving into the US market</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, precious metals remain the best performers since last week. Gold
is still moving up with good momentum. ZG is now up 24.50 overnight to
816.20. The major 800 resistance didn't held it for long. If we can stay
above this 800 level, then this is a great sign of the strength to come
for Gold. Otherwise, breaking 800 to 793 or so is expected as a
retracement. Just so as long as Gold doesn't break 780, this precious
metals rally is still good.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been trying to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/?s=bottom">catch falling knives</a> for a few weeks now.
Every time I think we're at a bottom, the market rally a bit to get my
hopes up and then continue to drift down more. In retrospect, there are
so many trading no-no's I have broken with that dangerous mentality. My
account is down significantly as of this writing and I have learned many
old and new lessons throughout these weeks. In fact, I have demonstrated
improving trading <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">technique</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1190/">psychology</a> even as I was losing
money overall (what an oxymoron). Rather I'm trying to comfort myself or
not, the fact is that losing money is simply unacceptable in trading. So
I will review these trades in this post and perhaps learn something from
them.</p>
<p>As the title suggest, this is a post for post-hoc analysis of the
options which I held into expiry (3 losing and 1 winning). I'll do this
chronologically. The longest Nov09 position I have is SLW Nov 2.5 Call.
I have been a big fan of SLW as I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written and traded SLW numerous
times</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, I've annoted my charts
more than usual and will show more and write less in this post. I noted
my entry point in each trade, and labelled the stop and post-hoc <strong>ideal
exit/stop points</strong>.</p>

<p>My effective <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">entry point in my SLW Nov 2.5 Calls</a> were at SLW share
price of \$2.90 (SLW closed at \$2.81 Friday). I bought 2 Calls for
\$0.55 and at expiry, they are worth \$0.325. A loss of \$45 + \$15 for
commission as of this writing. I held on to my 2.5 calls and exercised
them, so +200 shares of SLW for me.</p>
<p>Next up is ABB on the same day. The share price for ABB was at \$10.31
when I entered. ABB closed Friday at \$9.95. I bougt the three ABB Nov
10 Calls for \$0.90. They are worth \$0.05 each. A total loss of \$255 +
\$15 for commission.</p>

<p>Then we have TCK entered at TCK share price of \$5.575. I [bought two
TCK Nov 5 Calls for \$1.00][] each and they are now worthless. A
complete wipeout of \$200 + \$15 commission.</p>

<p>Lastly, there's this puny winning day trade in the last 40 minute of
Friday. I [bought a UYG Nov 3 Call for \$0.55][] and it expired for
\$0.95. A profit of \$40 - \$15 comission, so a total of +\$25 so far. I
held on to this call and exercised it. I have +100 shares of UYG to
carry over the weekend.</p>

<p>As you can see, <strong>if only I have used trailing stops, I could have held
onto some of the profits and not turn winning trades into a losing
ones</strong>. I didn't want to let the large swing in premiums stop me out
from a big rally. That's why I didn't use trailing stop. However, the
lack of subsequent follow-through and confirmation in the rally should
have been a glaring alarm sign. I should have put in trailing stops from
this lack of strength in the rally. <strong>Any counter-trend position should
be carefully managed with tighter than usual risk management</strong>.</p>
<p>I have let my <em>undying hope for a rally</em> clouded my judgement. This
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/move-from-certainty-to-curiosity-to-improve-your-trading/">stubborn need to be right</a> is a very fundamental psychological flaw
in trading. If I can't stop doing that in the future, I might as well
quit trading manually and focus on developing my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative financial
engineering</a> work. However, as I have noted, I think I'm improving
lately and upon further reflection, I believe I have come up with a
potential methodology to correct myself in the act ... More on this as I
develop on this technique.</p>
