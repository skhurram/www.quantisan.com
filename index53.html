                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/" rel='bookmark'>January 2010 Trading Performance Review</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>2010 didn't begin well for me. I experienced my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/first-2010-trading-drawdown-analysis-on-the-verge-of-a-new-record/">biggest drawdown</a> so
far at -3.95% (see Figure 1 for my account balance graph) in my demo
account. Given that I only risk 0.2% per trade, this is a relatively
substantial setback. Ironically, I was in the process of filling paper
work to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">open a live account</a> when this performance setback hit me.
Change of plan. Now I'll have to postpone live trading until I can at
least recover my demo account balance. To do that, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/work-harder-trade-fewer-in-a-long-and-excruciating-trading-drawdown/">tightened up</a> my
risk exposure and focused on playing only <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">my best setup</a>. By the
close of the month, my demo account is sitting at -1.2% for January. At
least I have made it some way from the bottom with a few <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">good
trades</a>. This is also the first negative month for me since beginning
trading forex in September, just 4 months ago.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="January 2010
Demo Account Balance"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/january_2010_account_balance.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Aside from my performance, a notable change this month for my trading is
the fact that I've been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/barred-from-trading-at-work-a-curse-or-a-gift/">barred from trading during the day</a>. This
forced me to trade less, which is a good thing. On the other hand, I'm
not able to manage my stops as often as I would have liked. As such,
I've been helpless at times and watched some profitable positions <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-gbpjpy-144-24-stop-143-60-target-148/">turn
sour</a>. Whereas before, I would have at least moved my stops to
breakeven when the price moved away enough. Obviously, this calls for a
drastic change to my current trading strategy. For one, I'm looking at
higher timeframes for my trading now to catch slower moves. Secondly, my
top priority for the next few months is to develop some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">trading bots</a>
to manage my risks while I'm away.</p>

<h2>Goal for February</h2>
<p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/december-2009-trading-performance-review/">goal from the previous month</a> is to think more and trade less.
Well, I managed the latter part but the former still requires work as
evident by my negative return this month. For February, my strategy is
to keep trading with half the risk exposure (i.e. 0.1% per trade) to
recover my account back to its all-time high in beginning of January.
I'm just about 2% away at this moment. My goal for February is to get
acquinted with MQL4 so that I can begin to develop expert advisors to
manage my risks during the day and overnight.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
One of the frontpage stories in my local newspaper today tells the tale
of how a [Deadly crash shattered teacher's life][]. A young couple is
left permanently paralyzed for one and crippled for the other. All
because of "brazen and aggressive" driving of two other drivers. Alan
Kippax was racing with his cousin Peter Kippax on the street. Peter lost
control of his Porsche and crashed into the aforementioned young
couple's Pontiac. Peter died in the crash and Alan was sentenced to be
guilty of his contribution in this tragedy. While this is certainly a
sad news, unfortunately, it isn't rare either. And what does it have to
do on my trading blog? You see, it is actually the last line of the
article that really caught my attention.

> Kippax, who used to run an emerald marketing network, Ontario Treasure
> Traders International, is global sales manager for Business In Motion.

Business In Motion. That rings a bell in my head. Exactly a year ago,
[CBC News aired an investigative journal][] on this company. In the
show, PSA President Robert L. FitzPatrick concludes:

> BIM is a blatant pyramid scam which ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ by its design
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ will inflict losses on 90+% of all consumers who
> are ensnared. from Pyramid Scheme Alert

Alan Kippax (the one alive) was never charged or questioned in Canada
regarding BIM. Even though he was convicted of fraud by the government
of England in another pyramid scheme and in lieu of overwhelming
evidence against him and BIM here in Canada. It is sad that it takes
another tragedy to bring to justice another tragedy. Yet, I find it
incredibly just that at least one more financial scam has come to an
end, although in an unfortunate manner. As for Kippax. I feel no remorse
for him. A loved one dies in his face and he's left alive to bear the
consequences of his crime (not to the full extent, but still) in prison.
How fitting is that for a scammer? (Yes, I am evil.) My questions are,
why are there still so many financial scams out there, right in our
backyards, in this so-called information age? Is our government
deliberately turning a blind eye or are they really that incompetent?
How many more [Madoff cases][] will it take for us to wake up to this
problem?

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p><strong>Update:</strong> I've switched over to long EURJPY @ 125.40 as EURGBP's
downtrend seem to be running out of steam. Moreover, EURJPY looks better
on the daily chart with a clear support and an oversold reading. I'm
back in my long GBPJPY play at 145.24. The currency pair is breaking an
hourly resistance since consolidating around 145. I had a low ball offer
at 144.20 since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-gbpjpy-146-42-for-140-pips/">taking my profit last night at 146.42</a>. But that bid
for never filled. So I'm re-entering on a short-term breakout. For this
entry, I am risking 0.1% of my account. This re-entry is a tough
decision. Almost all the respectable pros that I <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Quantisan">follow on Twitter</a>
are on the other side of this trade via other currency pairs. However,
my long setup is valid as long as GBPJPY is above 144 level. So I'll
take this trade until proven otherwise. Although I must admit that my
confidence in this trade is very low. I also considered long CADJPY
instead as it seems to offer more upside potential. However, as I've
been following the GBPJPY pair this week, I'll stick with my plan. I
also have a limit order to add more at 145.81 as you can see in Figure 1
below.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Just closed my GBPJPY long at 146.42 for around +140 pips average gain,
or 0.4% in the account balance. Damn good for a 24 hours holding. Obama
just finished his State of The Union address at the moment. I am not
impressed. Still all talk of change but nothing concrete yet. Anyway,
that's beside the point in this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>. 146.50 price level for
GBPJPY is the 10 day moving average. It has also been a strong support
back in late December. This should be a good resistance level. My guess
is that GBPJPY should stall, or even retrace, here for a while. Thus I'm
taking profit at this price as shown in Figure 1 (yellow triangle). I
still believe my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-gbpjpy-144-24-stop-143-60-target-148/">bullish setup from yesterday</a> is still good. So I'll
be watching this pair for a re-entry. Update: I re-entered at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-gbpjpy-145-24-stop-144-70-target-148/">145.24
the next day</a>.</p>
