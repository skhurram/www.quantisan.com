                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-cbrl-breakout-before-earnings/" rel='bookmark'>Paper trade: CBRL breakout before earnings</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Based on my previous post about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/finding-in-play-stocks-based-on-earnings-release/">finding stocks in play</a>, I've
identified <a href="http://www.crackerbarrel.com/">Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.</a> (CBRL) as a
candidate of an in-play stock. CBRL will release their earnings on Sept
15th before the market opens. So there's only Monday before the earnings
and then perhaps a few days after to play this stock.</p>
<p>The price I am watching is \$32.10 based on Figure 1. This is a breakout
setup to the long side. What caught my attention is the recent gap up
breaking a long term trendline resistance with only moderate volume. And
then the lack of a retracement with little volume on the down days
(Figure 2).</p>
<p>Stop Entry: \$32.10</p>
<p>Stop: \$31.40</p>
<p>Target: \$35. Based on the projecting from breaking the wedge formation
of Figure 1. The wedge's height is about \$2.50. So if CBRL breaks out
of \$32. The target is \$34.50. But the round number resistance is so
close at \$35, so it's likely that the push will reach that level.</p>
<p>Reward / Risk: 2.9 / 0.7 = 4.1 \&lt; 5.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>CBRL touched \$35 on September 16, just two days after
breaking my stop entry of \$32.10. This was a good trade.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>One of my trading shortcomings which I've lamented is the lack of an
automated method to pick and choose which stocks to play. I've
experimented with Yahoo's free stock screener a while ago but find that
the heavy dependence on basic statistics impractical. I've also
considered using <a href="http://www.stockfetcher.com/">StockFetcher.com</a> but don't like the use of
indicators as they are typically after-the-fact.</p>
<p>Today, I've learned through <a href="http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/09/nice-tool-for-identifying-stocks-in.html">TraderFeed</a> of <a href="http://www.finviz.com/screener.ashx">FinViz's stock
screener</a> tool. In particular, the tool has the option to filter out
stocks based on earnings release date. As day traders know, finding the
right stocks to play is a big step in the game. Stocks nearing earnings
release are generally a lot more active in terms of both price and
volume levels. Simply put, we can use FinViz's screener to find stocks
that will release their earnings soon so short term interest in the
stock will be high. Thus, more opportunities can arise.</p>
<p>Using this method should yield 10 to 20 stocks to analyse on a daily
basis for short term plays. The next step would be to apply your own
trading strategy in finding the best setups to play.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-cbrl-breakout-before-earnings/">CBRL is my first test candidate</a> from using this tool.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>In 2008, I spent a few good months <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">developing strategies</a> in
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/easylanguage/">TradeStation</a> full-time for the index futures. Now after a full year
of break in development, I am starting to devote more and more time in
quantitative finance research again. In hindsight, the biggest
shortcoming with my previous strategies is that they are not
discriminating enough. Using an analogy from robotics (my specialty),
some of the most basic robots are great because they can do one task,
and one task only, especially well. Those developers that are too
ambitious in trying to conjure a jack-of-all-trade robot typically fail
miserably. Our current technology simply isn't sufficient for anything
more than a specialized automation. Much is the same in developing
automated trading. With my limited resources and skills, my goal is to
build simple automated systems that can do one job only and do it damn
well. Once that can be achieved, it's only a matter of concatenating all
these individual systems to exploit more and more opportunities.
Therefore, the new plan which I'll follow for development are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify a recurring profitable scenario in the market</li>
<li>Isolate the conditions which would yield a high probability of such
    scenario happening</li>
<li>Program the findings into my platform</li>
<li>Run backtests to calculate the expected profit (probability *
    reward/risk)</li>
<li>Tweak and debug</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, remember this: <em>It's not a matter of the number of trades
you take, it's a matter of being as picky as you can in only playing the
best of the best trades you can find</em>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've finally managed to offload my COF puts. This position was entered
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-cof-100-sep-09-35-put-1-90-mark-35-89/">two weeks ago at 1.90</a>, mark 35.89. The <strong>total loss is \$60 +
\$15</strong>. This is yet another poor trade because I didn't exit when my
stop was hit. This has been happening way too often lately while I'm
trying to catch the top (another big mistake). While it might be
obvious, but it's now clear to me that playing with a limited capital is
detrimental to my trading psychology. The commission is too much in
comparison to my position size. So I was often inclined to hold when I
should have been nimble.</p>
<p>The market finally moved downward with a sizable move today. S&amp;P500
tanked 20 points in an hour this morning. However, on a second test of
the 1000 level, I noticed a divergence on the TICK and COF wasn't making
a low like the market. That's when I decided to unload this position as
we're at the bottom of the recent channel. In addition, the long term
support at \$35.45 (Figure 2, pink line) should be a tough nut to crack
in the short term.</p>
<p>My only position left is my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-15-bc-100-sep-09-7-5-put-39-mark-9-12/">puts in BC</a>. I am now going to tie my
hands away from my trading platform and step back to developing my
trade. On the other hand, my quantitative finance work has been
progressing nicely and I should be able to publish some useful updates
soon.</p>
<p>Update: COF closed at \$35.09 today. I was early again. It's pretty
clear by now that my strategy is flawed. The more reason why I need to
put my head down and really start thinking.</p>
