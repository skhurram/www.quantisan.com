            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update Oct 20: I raised my stop to 9.10 this moring. It got stopped out
2 minutes before the close for a small profit. Following the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-350-hgd-to-10-84-profit-2/">covering
of my short side play this morning</a>, I sneaked back in to the gold bug
camp. In particular, I bought some of my recent favourite gold miner,
Ventana Gold Corp. (VEN.TO), a few minutes before the close. Gold held
on to the 1330 support as I've discussed this morning (see <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-350-hgd-to-10-84-profit-2/">gold chart
in this morning's post</a>). I
also watched the closing 30 minutes of the market and VEN.TO respected
its 8.90 support level too. See Figure 1. There was a brief touch below
8.90 but it pushed back up quickly (not shown). This is a play inline
with the direction of the recent rally. Just riding the trend. Nothing
fancy. Hard stop is \$8.80. Mental stop is \$8.88. Maximum risk is
(\$8.95 - \$8.80) * 300 = \$45 + \$9.90 commission = \$54.90 = 0.5% of
account. There's a risk of another gap down open tomorrow. So my
position is small in case the market runs away overnight.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>China not-so-surprised the market (their delayed Treasury report was a
hint) with a 0.25% rate hike overnight (WSJ: <a href="http://on.wsj.com/afczTG">China Raises Interest
Rates</a>). The US Dollar shot up, precious metals took a big hit. I
close my gold short soon after the TSX market open to collect some quick
profit. Rinse and repeat. I did mention that this trade is a short term
swing. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-am-sorry-my-precious-bought-350-hgd-to-10-26/">bought this Horizons BetaPro Gold Bear Plus (HGD.TO)</a>, a
leveraged gold short, on Friday and unloaded it this Tuesday. I fought
against my greed to hold just a little longer. But the ascending support
line on gold is too obvious to ignore (Fig. 1). Thus I closed this short
term position with this 5%+ gap up while the market is still deciding
what to do. Furthermore, I noticed the equities market are holding
rather well at the open. S&amp;P500 held onto 1170 price level. Asian
markets were marginally green overnight. And even the CAC in Europe is
fighting an intraday low as the North American markets open. Thus, the
sky is not falling just yet. I figured it would take more omph to push
this market further down as we are indeed in a strong bullish move. At
the very least I am expecting some retaliation from the bulls. This
can't be this easy for the bears, can it?</p>

<p>Net profit for this trade is (\$10.84 - \$10.27) * 350 = \$199.50 -
\$9.90 commission = \$189.60 = 2% of account.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I cannot believe that I am doing this. I am shorting my favourite asset,
gold. Spot gold was trading at 1372 at the time of my short during lunch
hour (see Fig. 1). I bought 350 shares of Horizons BetaPro Gold Bear
Plus ETF (HGD.TO) to short gold. It is just more convenient to do that
in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">RRSP trading account at Questrade</a>. I am well aware of the
deteriorating value of a leveraged ETF (especially bearish ones). So I
don't intend to hold this for more than a few days. The reason for this
trade is simple. Today Bernanke made it clear that QE2 is on (WSJ:
<a href="http://on.wsj.com/atEQ2z">Bernanke Makes Case for Further Fed Moves to Boost Economy</a>).
Coincidentally, note the orchestrated weakening upward momentum across
precious metal (Fig. 1), currency (Fig. 2), and equities (Fig. 3).
Perhaps this is a matter of buy the rumour and sell the news? I am
betting that this rocket is running out of fuel. If I am wrong, I have
my stop set with a limited risk. If I am right, there's a long way down
from up here. So this trade is merely a matter of exploiting good
risk/reward. Stop is set at HGD.TO \$9.90. Anything below \$10.20 will
be a sign of caution. Maximum risk is (\$10.26 - \$9.90) * 350 = \$126
+ \$9.90 commission = \$135.90 = 1.4% of account. [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I don't know if anyone noticed, but in my previous post <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/three-obvious-reasons-to-watch-13000-on-the-tsx/">discussing the
TSX</a>, I included a chart of VIX (S&amp;P500 volatility index) versus S&amp;P
500. VIX is one of the market indicators that I can't live without.
However, as much as the Canadian and the American equity markets are
correlated, they are still separate markets. So using the VIX vs. S&amp;P500
on an analysis of the TSX is like borrowing salt from thy neighbour. But
there's no more need for that soon as TSX is finally getting its own
volatility index starting Monday (October 18)! This is to replace the MX
Implied Volatility Index (MVX) from the Montreal Exchange, which I
didn't have access to previously (aside from <a href="http://www.m-x.ca/indicesmx_mvx_en.php">data published on their
website</a>). One question I have is that the TSX VIX will be based on
TSX 60 index options activity according on their <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3D20101014_TSX-60-VIX_Volatility-Launch.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1243766536405&amp;blobheadervalue3=UTF-8">press release</a>, but
the TSX 60 index options isn't that active. So would the TSX VIX be as
efficient as the S&amp;P500 VIX? An opportunity with the introduction of TSX
VIX on the Toronto Exchange is that I can now place bets on market
volatility in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/ranking-investment-options-for-my-self-directed-rrsp/">self-directed RRSP trading account</a>. Which is
arguably more predictable than the underlying index these days... In any
case, this will be a vital market indicator for Canadian market traders.
For more information on TSX VIX, see the <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-tsx-60-vix/en/us/?indexId=sp-tsx-60-vix">product information page on
Standard &amp; Poor's</a>. And a hat tip to <a href="http://optionmatters.ca/">Option Matters</a> (Montreal
