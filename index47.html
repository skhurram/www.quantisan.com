            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>There's another reason why I am so <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">reluctant to put money into a TFSA
trading account</a> to invest in Canadian stocks. As you know, in a
registered trading account, such as a RRSP self-directed trading account
or a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade TFSA trading account</a> (aff), you cannot short shares
and can only buy because you can't trade on margin. As such, a
registered trading account is an account for buy-only trading. It
doesn't take a genius to figure out that a buy-only trading strategy is
best used ... in a bull market. As trading wisdom goes, trade with the
trend. So the question is, are we in a bull market in 2010? Figures 1
and 2 shows the weekly chart of TSX Index and the TSX Venture Index,
respectively. Referring to Fig. 1, TSX is bumping up against some
headwind at a 12,000 resistance. Unless TSX can stay above 12,000
cleanly (a weekly low above that level at least), I am still bearish in
the market because that financial crisis back in 2008 (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-breakdown-of-a-major-multi-year-support-are-we-going-down-and-i-mean-really-down/">remember those
days</a>?) is still overshadowing long term prices and trader sentiments.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TSX,
weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-03-04-TSX_wk.png" />][][/caption] TSX Venture is depressed even more as seen
in Figure 2 below. Just look at the huge gap from current price to the
200 week moving average (red line). This isn't a good sign as lack of
interest in high-risk stocks means traders are generally cautious. Yes,
it's true that the equity market has been running up, up, and up for a
good year. However, the fact that TSX is sitting at the same level as in
2001 proves that the long term, multi-year bull market has been cleanly
broken. We might very well see pockets of multi-month rallies
materialize (like we're seeing now), but unless proven otherwise, the
long term trend is not looking green for the markets. It will not be
easy money in the stock market like back in the pre-tech bubble 1990's.
As opined by Bill Cara, the <a href="http://www.caracommunity.com/">time for buy-and-hold is gone</a>. It is
well known in the community that the coming years will be volatile with
big ups and downs. That is my little secret for moving to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">trade
forex</a>last year and the main reason why I am reluctant to set aside
money on a one-sided stock trading account. [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just spent the last few hours looking into Google App Engine to use it
for trading. Google App Engine (GAE) is a cloud computing development
and hosting platform for web applications. GAE is similar to the
well-known Amazon EC2 service but it is also very different. The main
difference between GAE and EC2 is that GAE is not as flexible as EC2 but
it is a lot easier to develop on. Think of it like using C++ (EC2) to
write your own trading platform to using EasyLanguage on TradeStation or
MQL on Metatrader (GAE). Another advantage for using Google App Engine
is that it is free! Well, to a certain extent. It is free for a limited
monthly usage. However, Google's free quota is known to be very generous
(think Gmail) and this is no exception. Based on the numbers, it looks
comparable to a typical \$20/month virtual private server (VPS) hosting
package. My guess is that you can run a decent personal quant program on
it if you keep the resources for yourself (private use). For more
information on the free quota, you can read the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas.html">current GAE quota</a>
web page or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Engine">Wikipedia page for GAE</a>. You might be wondering how
did I spend a few hours just reading on GAE? The answer is that I've
done a brief research, planning, and assessment to see how GAE can be
put to use in terms of quantitative analysis for automated and
discretionary trading. Without going through all of my notes and logic,
here's the gist of my conclusion.</p>
<h2>For Automated Trading</h2>
<p>Since GAE is also a SDK, it has a restricted programming API. You can't
just plug in any custom library of your own (i.e. your broker's API)
into your program. That is its advantage and its disadvantage.
Furthermore, GAE only support HTTP and HTTPS. So you can't open a socket
for your connection either. These limitations won't be changing anytime
soon as GAE is designed to be like that for security reasons. Basically,
there's no way for your web application on GAE to connect with your
broker for trading. So much for that idea.</p>
<h2>For Discretionary Trading</h2>
<p>Things look brighter for discretionary trading though. A big bonus with
using Google App Engine is that it supports the Google Finance API.
Google Finance offers free real-time stock quotes. Combine it with the
programming capability of the Google App Engine and you have yourself a
free number cruncher in the cloud. However, GAE is definitely no match
for your personal computer, so why would you go through all that
trouble? One possible scenario in which this could be useful is for
traders that is often on the road or traders such as myself in which we
have a day job. In that case, you can set you quant analytics on GAE as
a private web application and then you can access it as a web page
anywhere on your mobile phone. One of the obvious limitation with using
GAE is that it has limited features for scientific computing. For
example, it doesn't support Numpy in the Python SDK. As such, I can't
imagine using GAE for anything more than simple technical analysis for
now. I certainly hope that GAE can include more powerful scientific
computing capabilities in the near future. Until then, I really can't
see Google App Engine offering much help aside from performing
algorithmic tasks to help with your trading analysis. Their open issues
log does announce that <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=190">Numpy is being integrated into GAE</a> though. So
that's a great sign for things to come! I am very hopeful of GAE's
potential as a free cloud server to host my quant analytics on. We'll
just have to wait for now.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I barely traded this month. The total number of trades in February for
my forex demo account is ten. That's far from my regular 150 - 250
trades a month. Ever since my trading system was broken because of
technical difficulties, I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-to-do-when-life-gets-in-your-way-of-trading/">changed my priorities</a> in trading. I
spent most of my time in February learning a new programming language to
ramp up my quant and automated trading projects. I also tried a few
longer term trades this month. The results haven't been uplifting. I am
about breakeven by the end of the month with a net gain of .... \$2 in a
\$5550 demo account. As you can see, there's really not much point in me
continuing paper trading at this stage. It is taking valuable time away
from me to fix what's broken so that I can use my previously profitable
trading system again. As such, I'm going to put near 100% of my effort
to program a semi-automated trading system for the coming weeks, or
probably months. On another note. Seeing that it is tax season here in
Canada. I thought about my tax situation and considered <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">opening a
Questrade TFSA trading account</a> (affiliate link) to legitimately
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/">avoid income taxes from trading</a>. But after considering the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">cost and
benefit</a> of such a move, I concluded that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-4/">a TFSA trading account
isn't cost effective for me</a> at the moment. As I've spent most of the
month doing backend work, there isn't very much to review for my trading
this month. So let's just dive right into my statistics for the record.</p>
<h2>Performance Statistics</h2>
<p><strong>Monthly Metric February (January)</strong> Sarting Fund \$5,550.02 End of
Month Fund \$5,551.99 Total Net Profit \$1.97 (-\$67.42) Gross Profit
\$37 (\$375) Gross Loss -\$35 (-\$442) Profit Factor 1.06 (0.85) Net
Profit % 0.04% (-1.20%) Max. Drawdown % 0.50% (3.95%) Sterling Ratio
0.00 (-0.15) Excess Return -0.02% (-1.26%) SDev Return per Trade 0.15%
(0.11%) Kurtosis -1.36 (1.85) Skewness 0.79 (1.01) With only ten trades
this month, I don't have enough samples to make meaningful calculations
for the above statistics. 95th Percentile P&amp;L \$12.55 (\$12.23) 5th
Percentile P&amp;L -\$6.60 (-\$8.43) Net Profit Mid 90% Only -\$4.75
(-\$117.84) Interestingly, I noticed that my typical top and bottom 5th
percentile profit/loss are quite consistent. Total # of Trades 10 (186)
Percent Profitable 40.00% (41.45%) # of Winning Trades 4 (63) # of
Losing Trades 6 (89) # of Break-even Trades 0 (34) My percent
profitable trades seem to be near 40% month to month. That's good to
know as it's useful to calculate my statistical return expectancy as
I've done in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-3/">TFSA trading cost-benefit analysis</a>. Average Trade
Profit % 0.00% (-0.01%) Average Winning % 0.17% (0.11%) Average Losing %
-0.11% (-0.09%) Ratio Win% / Loss% 1.59 (1.20) By being more
discriminating in my trades, I've effectively increased my win/loss
ratio. That's good. Max. Conseq. Winners 3 (8) Max. Conseq. Losers 5
(20) Largest Winning Trade \$13.81 (\$22.66) Largest Losing Trade
-\$7.08 (-\$14.30) Avg. Time Held [hrs] 1.67 (0.73) Avg. max. unrealized
profit/ Realized profit (11.59)</p>
<h2>Goal for March</h2>
<p>My goal from January is <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">to learn MQL4</a>. I changed my plan since then
due <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">my lack of faith with using a proprietary scripting language</a>. I
learned Python programming this month and is now learning to use
specialized libraries to serve my trading needs. My goal for March is to
write a rudimentary data analysis and visualization program for
historical forex data.</p>
