            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My NZD/USD short at 0.72509 just before noon today got stopped out an
hour later at 0.72661. At least it was only a 1/2 position. I wanted to
short again when NZD/USD broke 0.7280 because of the resistance as shown
in Figure 1. However, remembering #1 in my newly updated <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">3 trading
rules</a>, I re-considered and held back. NZD/USD is testing 0.7300 at
this moment, so this rule is proving itself useful already. What's
interesting now is that as NZD/USD is testing 0.7300, both USD/CAD and
USD/CHF are well off the support levels of 1.0700 and 1.0300,
respectively. There's no particular reason for using these two pairs,
they are just two pairs that I've been following. Which seems to me that
the weakness is USD isn't as bad as it would seem. If it is, then US
dollar would be under pressure in all fronts. And it's not now. At least
not yet. Thus, not giving up on this nice setup as shown in Figure 1,
I've placed a short stop entry for 50% position just below the next
intraday support at 0.7262. Just to catch it on its way down from this
very obvious resistance level. In any case, here're my 5 reasons for
shorting based on Figure 1.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend is neutral</li>
<li>We're at the top of a trading range</li>
<li>Near resistance at long term Fib level and round number at 0.7300</li>
<li>Potential double top, although this is very uncertain</li>
<li>Little breathing room in recent climb up</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, here is my order: Size: Half position, 3000 units Side:
Short Stop entry: 0.7262 Stop exit: 0.7300, set to trail Target: 0.7132,
top of that uptrending line in Figure 1 Reward / Risk = 130 / 38 = 3.42
> 3 I'm pondering should I enter 50% position when NZD/USD is hanging
around 07290. But I think I'll hold it off since my USD/CHF is still
open. Update: My short entry was triggered for 0.72509 (horrible
spread). I was stopped out at 0.72661 an hour later for a net loss of
\$4.57. This was not a good trade because NZD/USD was so close to a
round number resistance that it was probable to test it.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I figured I should write this sooner before the market moves more and
skew my thoughts on this entry. After my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdchf-out-at-1-03998-50-pips-and-1-03798-30-pips/">earlier entry in USD/CHF were
stopped</a> out this morning, I tried to enter once, got stopped out; and
then an even better setup appeared, so I entered again. See Figure 1.
This is a really awesome setup for the following 5 reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend is on our side as it's still pointing up.</li>
<li>Identical setup to last week's dive before the climb, same RSI, same
    candlestick</li>
<li>Bounced right at 1.031, which is at a longer term Fibonacci fan line
    as shown in Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Another support at round number 1.030, which is very near.</li>
<li>Good reward/risk ratio, see below for calculation.</li>
</ol>
<p>I entered 6000 units (2/3 position as usual) and placed the stop at
1.0300, just 20 pips away. USD/CHF climbed up to 1.0345 almost
immediately after my entry. So I moved my first stop to 1.0310
(Fibonacci level) for half my position. That got taken out minutes later
and it marked the bottom (for now) at 1.0309. I was a bit too hasten to
move my stop up for this part. See Figure 2 for my orders. One big
caveat to this entry is my tight stop at 1.0300. It is simply too
obvious of a stop price. I'd imagine the market would try to gun the
stops there before a run-up. However, if 1.030 breaks, it would ruin the
setup as described above. And if they're able to break that level, who
knows how far this can go further down. So I'm keeping my stop as is.
Anyway, I still have half of my initial position left. USD/CHF is
trading around 1.034. I don't think I'll do anything to this position
for now. I'm comfortable with just half position sitting in for the
weekend. Entry: 1.0320, Fib fan line support, see Fig 1. Stop 1: 1.031,
triggered already for a loss of 10 pips. Stop 2: 1.030, round number
support. Target: 1.038 - 1.040, starting point of this quick dive.
Reward/Risk = 60 / 20 = 3, right on the line of my goal. Although I am
secretly eyeing the 1.045 level as a target, I'll be cautious starting
from 1.038. Probably by setting a trailing stop if we do touch that. As
always, let's wait and see how this goes.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm all stopped out of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">USD/CHF positions from a couple of days
ago</a>. I considered re-entering when we failed to break 1.037 a few
minutes later. But the 1.04-1.043 range seemed heavy, so I postponed
that idea. About this trade, the maximum drawdown was terrific at a mere
0.12% (see stats below). I seem to do well with my entry. However, I'm
leaving profits on the table once again. For my second exit, USD/CHF
touched a high of 1.0451 but I was only able to get out at 1.03798.
Granted, this portion is supposed to be loose to capture bigger moves,
but that didn't happen. So once again, <strong>I need to work on my exit</strong>.
Another thing here is that my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">USD/CHF target of 1.045</a> was spot on. I wanted to exit half
my position at that level. But I couldn't figure out how to do both
target stop and stop loss at the same time after my entry order is sent.
This problem has been resolved by asking customer support at Oanda. I'm
not entering any more new trade (aside from the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-nzdusd-entry-stop-0-7040/">NZD/USD stink bid</a>
which I placed this morning) because it's Friday and I don't see anymore
obvious good setup across the board (a small board) for my 4h timeframe.
<strong>Update:</strong> Nevermind, I was eyeing 1.0350 when I got stopped out as a
entry point. USD/CHF just touched it as I'm writing this post. So I'm
back in now with a tight trailing stop... (and it doesn't seem to be
holding after just a few minutes... and it's stopped out for an
additional loss of \$4.86 on this tap.) Entry: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">1.03498, 6000

            <div class="article-content"> <p>USD/CHF is chalking a wide V pattern now. The up-leg has played out
nicely for 2/3 of the way. According to T-theory, USD/CHF should reach
1.045 on Monday. Furthermore, USD/CHF is testing support at the top fin
of the Fibonacci fan line as seen in Figure 1. 1.034 is also a short
term support by an up-trending line, see Figures 1 and 2. Lastly, the
current trend is up as shown by my 2-MA lines in Figure 1. In summary,
both short and intermediate trends are aligned and we're at support now,
thus, I bought when the reward/risk is favourable. Entry: 1.03498 Stop:
1.03240 Target: 1.0450 Reward / Risk = 100.2 pips / 25.8 pips = 3.9 I
initially placed my stop at 1.0295 but realized the reward/risk was
horrible. So I moved my stop up to make this a shorter timeframe play
(i.e. a quick reflex bounce). On another note, the order types at
<a href="http://www.oanda.com/">Oanda</a> (my forex broker) is severely handicapped. It only has the
basics. For example, I would have liked an order-cancel-order type so
that I can place a contingent exit at the profit target and the stop.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I went long USD/CAD this morning with 1/3 position when we bounced back
up to 1.0800 and then retraced to 1.075. It was stopped out about an
hour and a half later. In hindsight, this was not a good trade for one
major reason. <strong>I should not have gone against the short-term trend on a
weak support level even if the intermediate trend is on my back</strong>. I
should have at least waited for stronger support around 1.0650. Figure 1
is a chart of the 15-min USD/CAD with my orders marked. When USD/CAD
failed to break 1.0800, a major resistance, it was a sign that the short
term trend remains bearish. At least I entered a stop and didn't let the
loss accumulate. Below are the statistics for this trade. On another
note, my stink bid placed at 1.0666 this morning seems likely to be
triggered (USD/CAD is trading at 1.0679 as of this moment of writing).
My stop for that is 1.0600. This is a better entry because there's a
multi-day resistance at 1.0600 and crude is testing a significant \$70
resistance too. Although if I'm more conservative, I should be more
patient and wait for 1.0600 instead... So I'm only entering 1/3 position
for this instead of the 2/3 as in my strategy (revised since my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdcad-all-out-1-0872-196-6-pips-and-1-0821-145-6-pips/">last
paper trade in USD/CAD</a>). See Figure 2 for the support/resistance.
<strong>Update:</strong> I retracted my bid at 1.0666 because crude oil broke above
\$70 and USD/CAD hang on to 1.0672 or so for a few hours. If we do break
it, it would only create another short-term sell-off. So there's no
point in me having an entry just 6 pips below at 1.0666. It will just
get washed down when the support breaks. Entry: 1.07426, 3000 units
