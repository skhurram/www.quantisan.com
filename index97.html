            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I said on Tuesday, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-is-looking-ready-to-continue-its-bear-rally/">the market looked like it's going up</a>, and
going up it went. In last week's review, I also said <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-march-29-2009/">we're in a
congestion zone around 820 - 830</a> for the S&amp;P 500. Well, we finally
broke above 830, yet, the volume was light. We had acceptable volume on
Thursday when we broke through 840 for the first time in this up leg,
but the follow through on Friday was disappointing. We reached
marginally higher on Friday but the volume was almost non-existent.</p>
<p>Looking at Figure 2, we can see that 840 is exactly the point when we
ended our first crash in October 10, 2008. If we are to break that
resistance, we definitely need more momentum than what Friday provided
us. As it stand now, this 840 is a critical pivot point in both the long
and short term. Thus, we could be in for some more range-bound trading
as the market bounces around this level prior to a big move. However,
note that we've been in this range for over a week already ... so this
is a good time to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-gs-100-apr-09-105-put-955/">manage your risks</a> in case the market gaps against
your favour.</p>
<p>Also, Thursday's gap up provided a nice point to draw a new bullish
channel. And what do you know, the supports are pegged at 820 and 800
again ...<strong>This is going to be one big move one way or the other with
everything seemingly coming together in the short and long term</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>GICS Sectors Review</strong></p>
<p>From the 6-month chart, we see that the Financial (XLF) and Industrial
(SLI) are still testing their respective resistances from February. On
the other end of the run, the Technology and Telecom sectors (XLK, IYZ)
has broken above several resistances and is leading the pack. This is
definitely something to keep in mind, i.e. <strong>find values in the
Techs/Telecom to ride upon on the way up</strong>. Basic Materials (XLB) is a
close third.</p>
<p>From the 1-month chart, it's pretty clear that the financial made a
dead-cat's bounce this month and led the pack by a good margin.
Healthcare (XLV), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Utilities (XLU), a.k.a.
the defensive sectors, are at the bottom of the pack. This is no doubt
yet another mark of a bear rally as people are pulling money from these
safe havens into more riskier sectors.</p>
<p>More importantly though, of the top 5 leading sectors in this month's
rally, only the Industrial (XLI) failed to make a new high in this
week's run compared to the week before. This is definitely a big thumb
down for the Industrial. Which coincides with my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">analysis for General
Electric (GE)</a>, in particular, so far. <strong>Correction:</strong> Upon closer
inspection of the individual tickers, both XLF and XLI are making a
short term double top.</p>
<p>The 5-day chart is basically a zoomed in version of the 1-month. Thus,
we're still in a bear rally mode this week. Actually, we see that the
Healthcare (XLV) is lagging even farther to its two other friends (XLP,
XLU) for the week.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Yes, I'm still holding on to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-31-srs-4808/">SRS from yesterday</a>. I'm down
\$10/share at the close today. However, we are just testing a long term
support line here. Furthermore, the market is only up about 1% today
whereas SRS tanked 17.58%. This is definitely capitulation of SRS we're
seeing now. The question I ask myself is, would I be buying at this
level? Given the above two reasons, the answer is yes. Yet, I would
definitely ditch it early next week if there's continued weakness for
SRS.</p>
<p>My biggest mistake for this trade is entering too early. Note to self,
<strong>wait for a bounce from support before entering and set a hard stop
just below it</strong>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>S&amp;P 500 at 840 looks like a strong resistance so far. Volume is light
today. In addition, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">my short, GE</a>, is still below its \$11
resistance. And the finanacials isn't moving much.</p>
<p>Target: \$85, around the 200d MA and my trendline as shown, Figure 1
right.</p>
<p>Stop: around \$45 - \$46. Or S&amp;P 500 staying above 850.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This rally in the market looks a bit over stretched based
on the indicators. We've been going up and up since the beginning of
March. I still believe we're in a long term downtrend. That's why I'm
shorting this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-is-looking-ready-to-continue-its-bear-rally/">counter-trend rally</a>. And today looks like a good day.</p>
<p>Update: I seem to have a thing for picking my stops. SRS just glazed
below \$45 and then bounced back to above \$46. My stops typically mark
the turning point. In other words, I'm usually in too early. So if I
just set my entry price to my stops instead and let the price come to
me, then that might be a better entry for me. Better yet, <strong>before
entering a position, wait for the stock to hit my mental stops and watch
how it performs</strong>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Despite <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/end-of-month-review-march-is-bear-rally-month/">my pessimism</a>, I think this bear rally may have steam to go
even farther up in this run before the final flush down. Here're my
reasons.</p>
<p>​1. We have touched the 38% Fibonacci retracement level precisely last
week and have been making higher lows. See Figure 1.</p>
<p>​2. As I noted in the morning, the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/end-of-month-review-march-is-bear-rally-month/">up days have noticeably more volumes
than the down days</a> in this rally.</p>
<p>​3. My two favourite shorts, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">GE</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-gs-100-apr-09-105-put-955/">GS</a>, are resisting to stay
below their supports. In particular, Figure 2 shows that even in today's
swinging moves, they closed above their intra-day supports at noon while
the S&amp;P 500 broke its intraday support at noon, just barely. In fact,
today's move look a lot like <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-277-tck-487/">TCK when it retraced</a> (and when I
unloaded), just to punch through to much higher later. If that's any
indication, these two (and the market) will be breaking their long term
resistances within days.</p>
