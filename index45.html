            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been fortunate enough to not have to think about taxes for the
longest time. Unfortunately though, that is because of my long stay in
academia plus a couple of years of a low salary research position. I
didn't have to pay much income taxes, if at all. Things are different
now that I am working in a full time job with a decent pay. I am
reminded of the impact of our high Canadian taxes from the missing chunk
on every paycheck. That is why I am looking into what to do with my RRSP
contribution lately. Last month, I analyzed the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">cost-benefit of a Tax
Free <em>Trading</em> Account</a>. I concluded that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-4/">a TFSA trading account is
not worth my while</a> for the moment. So I will probably just stash my
TFSA contribution in a good old savings account for now. That is not the
case with a RRSP. One big difference that change the whole argument
around with RRSP is that any contribution that I make into it is tax
deductible! I won't go into details here because I hate taxes. Refer to
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_Retirement_Savings_Plan">Wikipedia entry on RRSP</a> if you are unfamiliar with it.
Essentially, I am guaranteed about 30% (or your marginal tax rate) of
"profit" by way of tax refund for the amount of money which I put into
my RRSP account. I don't know about you, but 30% is a massive return for
me! And it's risk free! (Technically it's just a refund of my own money,
but still) The benefit of having a RRSP is obvious. What I have been
pondering about is where should I put my money in my RRSP? As I
discussed in <em><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/">Benefits of trading in a TFSA account</a></em>, there are many
limitations to a self-directed registered account. Although there are
certainly other options than just trading stocks in a registered
account. Here are the options that I have considered.</p>
<ol>
<li>Savings account</li>
<li>Fixed income</li>
<li>Mutual funds</li>
<li>Exchange traded funds</li>
<li>Individual stocks</li>
</ol>
<p>In my next post, I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/ranking-investment-options-for-my-self-directed-rrsp/">rank my preferences for each retirement investment option</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The good news is that I have finished my data scraping module for
extracting all the company data listed on the two Toronto Stock
Exchanges (TSX and TSV). I presented an <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/data-scraping-the-toronto-stock-exchange-extracting-3660-companies-data/">alpha version of this data
scraping module</a> last week. I added the functionality to download all
the historical quotes from Yahoo for all the companies. These data are
stored locally in a cool HDF5 format with PyTables. I am very happy
about that part. The bad news is that my module looks more like a hacked
job than a piece of software. There is no defined structure for my
underlying codes. It is obvious to me that this module would be
difficult to extend, which is the whole point of my project. In
programming jargon, my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code smells</a> (Wikipedia). Then it finally
dawned on me. I am <em>way</em> behind in my programming skills. For the past
few years, my quant work has been confined to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/starting-to-use-matlab-for-quantitative-finance/">MatLab</a> or some
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-automated-trading-development-platforms-for-beginner-to-advanced-traders/">proprietary trading platforms</a>. I wrote scripts. Not programs. My
problem with programming is that I am still stuck in a procedural
programming mentality because that is what I've always used. Even though
I updated my knowledge recently by learning Python, learning to program
with an object oriented programming language is only the first step. (I
am also familiar with C++ and Java from way back) To use an analogy,
programming a software is like constructing a building. The actual
coding itself is akin to the construction work. I got that part. But
coding without a well designed plan can only go so far. It is now clear
to me that if I am to build the trading software to complement my
trading as I have envisioned it, I need to step it up with my <em>software
design</em> ability. Consequently, I am now catching up on object oriented
design and analysis, as well as software design patterns with a couple
of books. I will try not to get too carried away with these though. My
main focus is trading. But this will be very beneficial for my trading
in the long run if I can build a more robust trading software that can
easily grow with my future needs. I have many big plans for this side
project of mine. I posted a UML diagram showing an <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-is-your-trading-process/">architectural
overview of my project</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Parity, parity, parity. That's all I hear about in Canada these days.
The <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-13/loonie-approaches-parity-on-bets-central-bank-to-increase-rates.html">media is saying</a> (Businessweek) that the strength in loonie is
due to a higher than expected inflation data and so a possible rise in
our interest rate by the Bank of Canada this year is in the cards. But
that's just part of the story. As I was saying in my previous post,
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-should-i-care-about-other-markets-if-i-only-trade-___/">markets don't operate in a vacuum</a>. The biggest news so far this year
on the global economy is the Greece bailout. Or more specifically, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2010/03/18/is-there-a-greece-bailout/">is
there a bailout</a> (WSJ) and <em>by whom</em>? Greece is the 27th biggest
economy according to Wikipedia. Their GDP is 24% of Canada's. They are
by no means a small country. A default of this magnitude would have a
domino effect on the weak PIGS (Portugal, Ireland/Italy, Greece and
Spain) countries and beyond. Traders will lose confidence if Greece is
not saved. Then everyone will unload their holdings in those PIGS
countries and massive selling will drive their markets even further
down. A vicious cycle of downward spiral is thus formed in the short
term. Given that even a small time trader such as myself is aware of the
grim consequence, it is likely that Greece will be saved. So the next
question is, by whom? That is the big question which is still up in the
air and fiercely debated this month. The two candidates are the European
Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As far as
we know, the ECB doesn't seem to want to take the burden upon itself.
The European Union isn't doing exactly well lately, in case you haven't
noticed. Its best performing country, Germany, doesn't want to penalize
their hardworking taxpayers for <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?countryName=Greece&amp;countryCode=gr&amp;regionCode=eu#2116">the mistakes of Greece</a> (CIA World
Factbook). So that leaves the IMF, the last line of defense for troubled
economies. If the IMF bails out Greece, that means the United States is
on the hook too as they are the biggest economy and backer of the IMF.
Europe's problem will become an American problem too. More bailouts for
the U.S. means more spending. Having spent <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">trillions already pumping up
the financial markets</a> (U.S. debt clock) in the past couple of years,
this would tank the U.S. dollar into the abyss. Likewise, if the ECB
confirms that they will contain the problem and that IMF isn't involved.
The Euros will tank and the dollar will rise. But that's just guess work
for now. The one thing that's for sure is that a massive amount of money
will be spent to save Greece. Excessive money means inflation and higher
cost of commodities in the long run. Seeing that the Canadian market is
heavily commodity-related and that our loonie is even known as a
commodity currency, that is the reason behind why inflation is rising
fast and our economy is being propped up. Not necessarily because we are
doing terrific, but because we are sitting on a pile of gold and oil.
Real, tangible wealth in any kind of economy.</p> </div>
