<p>One of the most, if not THE most, important theme in trading is
identifying if we're in a bull or bear market. It's easier to "ride with
the wave" than to fight against it. While there are an abundance of
work, studies, theories, or whatever, on calling out market sentiments,
I feel that the most useful way of doing it would be ones that stick to
the facts. And the only fact we can be certain of in the market is the
price.</p>
<p>So here's the idea (definitely not original) for <strong>guessing</strong> market
sentiment.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bull market = 50 dma > 200 dma for S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>Bear market = 50 dma \&lt; 200 dma for S&amp;P 500.</li>
</ol>
<p>As with any indicator, this is not a law. It's just a signal to give you
a piece of information for you to <strong>intrepret</strong> based on the
fundamentals and maybe other technical analysis tools.</p>

<p>I placed some limit sell on ESLR last Friday at \$6, and then lowered to
\$5.7. I lowered it again to \$5.6 in the morning and actually thought
of executing a market sell when it was around \$5.55. In that hour or
so, I pondered should I exit my ESLR to limit my exposure to market
volatility. At the time, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/slw-and-eslr-broke-support-and-stop/">ESLR was my weakest position</a>, and my 2nd
most money losing holding.</p>
<p>My intraday signals were showing weakness, but my daily was undecided.
Just before lunch, I decided to keep my shares (and cancelled my exit
working order) because I want to hold this for the long term (at least
weeks).</p>
<p>In retrospect, I really should trust my signals. I knew the market could
dive in the short term as we haven't reached capitulation and widespread
fear yet. I have let my emotion got the better of me by not wanting to
miss the bottom. In hindsight, the phrase "it's better to be safe than
sorry" couldn't have been more appropriate.</p>
<p>ESLR closed at \$3.47 yesterday, way below my initial <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-eslr-599848/">stop loss target
of \$5.6</a>. The time to cut losses short is long gone. It's either
surrender now or wait for the calming of the market.</p>
<p>I decided to wait through the storm in this round. I still think we are
very near the bottom. Hmm... haven't I said that before already when
ESLR was at \$6.0+ ... ?</p>

<p>Seriously, I will wait a few days until making an order. There's too
much emotion in the market at the moment. (i.e. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122346445779914857.html">WSJ: Central Banks Cut

<p>Dow Plunges 350 on Unemployment, Factory Reports. Lots of panic
headlines today. A definite 180 degree turn from yesterday's, and
another 180 from the day before. The flip-flopping sentiments of the
media are just too funny. This is definitely a time of high volatility
and uncertainty. Even at today's "plunge", the fact is, the markets are
still up from last week. We could very well be seeing the bottom being
set in this bear market. I think the worst of this downturn has unfolded
in the past year already.</p>
<p>In any case, I am definitely a bit early in my long term entries. Both
SLW (-15.6%) and ESLR (-14.1%) have broke support, but still far from
52-week lows. I am reluctant to sell at this time because the market is
in panic mode. Yet, both prices are below the stops I've set for myself.</p>
<p>I would go long on SLW at this price if I had the fund. The indicators
are on buy alert too.</p>

<p>ESLR is more risky at the moment because although the price is off a
lot, it's still dancing around the 20 dma. It could very well break the
52-week low from here.</p>

<p>This is suppose to be another of my GTC limit order before leaving to
Taiwan. I've set the buy order at \$25.0 on 25th. I got back on the 30th
(29th EST) and CAF looked strong. So I wanted to replace my \$25 bid to
\$26... However, I wasn't careful and the trading platform changed the
limit price to the market ask without me realizing until I placed the
order. Of course, then the order was filled and I got in at \$28.89,
higher than I would have wanted. I thought of exiting the position
immediately, at a small lost, but decided against it because I felt CAF
is going strong. I didn't need to pick the bottom and I was never good
at that anway. So I chose to stick with this entry.</p>
<p>But what do ya know, that afternoon, the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aJY4KBvL.dRE&amp;refer=home">US House decided to reject the
\$700-billion rescue plan</a>. DJIA tanked 777 points that day and the
financials were hit the hardest of course. My \$26 bid would have seemed
like an ingeneous entry as CAF hit a low of \$25.11 that day. However, I
wouldn't have guessed that.</p>
<p>Given the high amount of volume at the low and near the end of the
trading day, I doubt we will see that price any time soon for CAF. \$25
is definitely a strong support.</p>
<p>Upside: Daily chart still looks good. Financials are in severe panic
mode.</p>
<p>Resistance: A downward trendline is capping recent highs. \$30 round
number looks like the high end of trading range.</p>
<p>Downside: Possible turn to bearish from indicators. Financials earnings
coming soon, the numbers aren't gonna be pretty.</p>
<p>Support: \$26 looks like the bottom of the trading range we're in now.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: CAF has weathered the Dow 777 day drop with style. It has
shown strength at the worst of times. However, don't expect a steady
climb from here. At this market's condition, anything is possible (i.e.
more panic days in the coming weeks and CAF would be thrown out along
with the financials again). I don't think this is to be a buy and hold
position yet. So watch for breakouts either way and be ready to trade in
and out.</p>
<p>On another note, if I have more funds, I'd rather be scaling in CAF on
the lows for the long term instead of swing trading for a few bucks.</p>

<p>Just before leaving for Taiwan on the 25th, I placed a GTC limit order
buy for SLW at \$8.80. The order executed on September 29th, 9:32am, at
the open. I can't remember the exact reasons for the \$8.80 price point.
I should post an entry when I do limit orders from now on just to be
clear.</p>

<p>However, looking at the charts of SLW and Silver (YI), things are
looking bearish for SLW. I will watch this position and be ready to exit
as soon as needed or on a small bounce. It's funny that what I believe
to be my most "stable" company turned out to be the one I'm worrying
about in my current holdings. I guess that's a good sign as I'm not too
attached to any company or having too much faith in them. <strong>Being
skeptical and remaining critical of your positions are what's essential
in trading</strong>.</p>
<p>Fee \$5</p>
<p>Upside: Still haven't touched the 50 dma. Price is in trading range near
the 52-week low.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$9.0, then 10.</p>
<p>Downside: Indicators seem to be turning bearish.</p>
<p>Support: Round number \$8.0, although the current price is already
skimming on it. More likely \$7.50, just below the all time low of
\$7.62</p>
<p>Bottom line: My signals have turned negative on SLW. I will try to get a
good exit.</p>

<p>In recent years, I've started to like Dell computers more and more.
Their laptops has been well priced and quality built (I don't have much
experience with their other products). Their recent introduction of the
Dell Mini 9, for example, shows great management on many levels. It is a
solid product that addresses the competitors' problems, at a competitive
price, and timed well for an entry when netbook is starting to prove to
be more than just a fad with real market potentials.</p>
<p>Dell is a company I'd like to hold for the long term just because I like
them so much.</p>
<p>Upside: PE at 12.32. Indicators buy setup, see daily graph. Michael Dell
bought \$100 million worth of shares above \$20 on Sept 4/5.</p>
<p>Resistance: Sept 19 high of around \$18.50</p>
<p>Downside: Recession, low demand, stiffer competitions. Taiwanese
computer manufacturers like Asus, Acer, and MSI are stepping into Dell's
territory.</p>
<p>Support: Sept 19 low of \$15.50</p>
<p>Bottom line: Just like their products, I feel that DELL offers real
value.</p>
<p>Target: 50 dma of \$22</p>
<p>Stop: \$15.00</p>
