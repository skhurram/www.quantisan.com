<p>I mentioned previously <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/">about avoiding volatility</a>. But with VIX about
75 now, I couldn't help but to take the opportunity to day trade. I
know, I know, I said I wouldn't do it again. So I'm only trading an
account with<strong>paper money</strong>.</p>
<p>To illustrate the abundance of day trading opportunities these days, I
just launched my trading screen and within minutes I can see a viable
setup.</p>
<p>On the 1 minute chart on the left, notice the small doji at \$844 with a
high volume. Also off the chart is a low of \$837 for the day in the
morning. So \$840 is an effective support for the moment. Since the doji
at \$844 is above \$840, this is a good sign for the time being.</p>
<p>So I placed buy orders around \$845 for the next few minutes and exiting
below \$850 (obvious resistance), with intent to get back later in if it
breaks \$850 strongly. This went on for a few minutes, and I traded in
the range taking small profits twice, until the price broke to \$841.50,
which I stopped at a loss at around \$842.50.</p>
<p>However, noticing it's in a steady climb from then on, I entered a long
at \$845 again, with stop at \$841, for a longer trade. The price rose
to \$853.75, bounced back to \$850, and started dropping. I exited my
long at a small profit at \$849.50 on a retracement.</p>
<p>ES keeps dropping for those seconds until \$845.75 and bounced right
back to \$851. That was a good sign. I believe the initial \$850 break
and retracement was just a technical bounce. So I went in again at \$851
a bit later intending to ride it up to \$860.</p>
<p>That trade went as planned and I exited at \$858. I reversed and went
short at \$861 with a tight stop at \$863. The stop got hit and the
price went up to \$866.</p>
<p>I decided to stop there since the trading screen didn't lean much to
on-the-spot analysis. I'm not asking for a full charting screen though,
that would be overkill for day trading. Simplicity is key. I'd be happy
if they had 1-min and 15 min candlestick charts with 2-line EMA, MACD,
Stochastic, and volume information. In the end, I'm \$162.50 richer in
paper money after 12 trades.</p>
<p>Although it's a profitable session, I think I took way too many trades
to reach that.</p>
<p>Since my trading platform is very basic and isn't meant for day trading,
I didn't even have a chart on the trading matrix. I just looked at the
price movements and occasionally flip back to the chart. However, I do
have one good indicator for use... which is the price of Goldman Sachs
(GS). Long story short, we're in a financial driven crisis and GS (along
with MS and others) is one of the two surviving investment banks (of
original 5) in this mess. GS were off the lows of the day and moving up
very slowly throughout the few minutes which I day traded. That was a
good enough bullish sign for me to go long.</p>

<p>In light of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-capitulation-under-way/">market crash this week</a>, my ESLR is the holding that
worries me the most. It is the only one of my holdings without any
profit at the moment. At times like we're in now, ideally I would only
go long on the strongest companies, in the strongest sectors.</p>
<p>ESLR closed at 3.44 today. It's long term low is at 3.3. Here's a quick
reassessment of the situation.</p>
<p>Upside: Still above support level while markets are hitting new lows.
Lots of volume at the previous \$5 level. MACD and Stochastic showing
divergence, assuming it doesn't break support... definitely too early to
tell. Volume is uptrending on recent fall.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$4.</p>
<p>Downside: Low volume on recent small rally. Little volume today when
it's testing the low. Trend is still negative.</p>
<p>Support: \$3.3 and then ... \$2.50? Ouch!</p>
<p>Bottom line: Lots of panic and fear at the moment. Contrarian buy signal
perhaps? I'm not buying or selling at this level in any case. I'm going
to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/didnt-cut-losses-as-planned-and-now-paying-dearly/">stick to my plan and brace through this week</a>. Then I'll either
surrender my shares at a huge loss or keep holding for the longer term.</p>
<p>Here's my take on a purely speculative feel... the recent action on ESLR
seems like it's being accumulated by some big players. Two-stage
accumulation: 1) Huge reverse on new low to lure in chasers. 2) Price
drifts back down on increasing volume, but not too much to attract
attention. I don't know, this could be my emotion talking. That's why
I'm waiting for things to calm down first before making a move.</p>

going to point out this week's market plunge with respect to the longer

<p>With VIX at a multi-year high and the current market turmoil, it seems
to be a good time to write about market volatility.</p>
<p>Market volatility is a two-edged sword. Day traders dream of catching
the 800 point swing in the YM contracts. Yet, most would lose more being
stopped out before giving up and then missing the swing. For long term
traders, these 800 point swing could cause panic (if you're on the wrong
side) or doubts (should you or should you not take the profit?).</p>
<p>Based on my brief experience in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/day-trading/">day trading</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures markets</a>,
I am not one to play with fire. For my longer term plays, I am <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/didnt-cut-losses-as-planned-and-now-paying-dearly/">feeling
the pain as we speak</a>. Thus, it is important to realize that although
market <em>volatility is very tempting for quick profits, greed never pays
in trading</em>. Another characteristic in a highly volatile market is that
there're a lot of emotions going on. As you know, emotions can cloud our
judgement. It's more difficult to trade when you're filled with panic,
fear, greed, excitement, etc.</p>
<p>In other words, market volatility is bad because 1) large swings both
ways at any time and 2) lots of emotions in the market and yourself.</p>
<p>To minimize your risk, it's better to minimize your exposure to the
market at times of high volatility. Thus, I use the rule that...</p>
<p><strong>If 50 dma of VIX > 20, then reduce position size to some % (i.e. 50%)
of usual amount.</strong></p>
<p>As a corollary, here's another interesting idea. It's widely known that
markets tend to creep up and plunge down, i.e. rising slow and steadily,
and fall quick and hard. Looking at the 50 dma VIX, it's actually a
quicker indicator for the 2007 top than my previous <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/back-to-basics-market-sentiment-via-2-line-ema-on-sp500/">2-line EMA
indicator for market sentiment</a>. Conceptually, if we accept that bull
market is slow and bear market is fast, then this idea of using VIX to
signal bull/bear sentiment do seem viable. However, there's already too
many IF's and assumptions for me to take this seriously. Therefore,
let's just stick with using volatility for managing position sizing
only.</p>

<p>One of the most, if not THE most, important theme in trading is
identifying if we're in a bull or bear market. It's easier to "ride with
the wave" than to fight against it. While there are an abundance of
work, studies, theories, or whatever, on calling out market sentiments,
I feel that the most useful way of doing it would be ones that stick to
the facts. And the only fact we can be certain of in the market is the
price.</p>
<p>So here's the idea (definitely not original) for <strong>guessing</strong> market
sentiment.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bull market = 50 dma > 200 dma for S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>Bear market = 50 dma \&lt; 200 dma for S&amp;P 500.</li>
</ol>
<p>As with any indicator, this is not a law. It's just a signal to give you
a piece of information for you to <strong>intrepret</strong> based on the
fundamentals and maybe other technical analysis tools.</p>

<p>I placed some limit sell on ESLR last Friday at \$6, and then lowered to
\$5.7. I lowered it again to \$5.6 in the morning and actually thought
of executing a market sell when it was around \$5.55. In that hour or
so, I pondered should I exit my ESLR to limit my exposure to market
volatility. At the time, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/slw-and-eslr-broke-support-and-stop/">ESLR was my weakest position</a>, and my 2nd
most money losing holding.</p>
<p>My intraday signals were showing weakness, but my daily was undecided.
Just before lunch, I decided to keep my shares (and cancelled my exit
working order) because I want to hold this for the long term (at least
weeks).</p>
<p>In retrospect, I really should trust my signals. I knew the market could
dive in the short term as we haven't reached capitulation and widespread
fear yet. I have let my emotion got the better of me by not wanting to
miss the bottom. In hindsight, the phrase "it's better to be safe than
sorry" couldn't have been more appropriate.</p>
<p>ESLR closed at \$3.47 yesterday, way below my initial [stop loss target
of \$5.6][]. The time to cut losses short is long gone. It's either
surrender now or wait for the calming of the market.</p>
<p>I decided to wait through the storm in this round. I still think we are
very near the bottom. Hmm... haven't I said that before already when
ESLR was at \$6.0+ ... ?</p>

<p>Seriously, I will wait a few days until making an order. There's too
much emotion in the market at the moment. (i.e. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122346445779914857.html">WSJ: Central Banks Cut
