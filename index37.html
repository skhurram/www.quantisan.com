            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been barking up the short-Aussie-tree since the beginning of the
year. See post [#1][], [#2][] on AUDJPY, and [#3][], [#4][] on
AUDCAD for the long term analysis. (Also see my post on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/early-bird-does-not-get-the-worm-in-forex-trading/">being early
shorting the Aussie</a>.) Anyway, now that AUDUSD has backed off the 9300
level with a bang, it seems that the trend reversal in the Aussie is
getting clearer. Why do I say that? Notice the sequence of recent AUDUSD
price action depicted in the daily chart of Figure 1.</p>
<ol>
<li>Breaking below lower long term trendline (thick brown line, Fig. 1)
    on Dec 14 followed by a 300 pips down move</li>
<li>Reversing on Dec 22 at 8730 price level, right on the last long term
    support line</li>
<li>Testing the same trendline in #1 from below and gliding along it
    since the new year</li>
<li>Bouncing off the previous resistance at 0.9330</li>
<li>A rapid breakdown right to the neckline support at 0.9100</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, the breakdown of gold price (Fig. 2) is helping to keep the
downward momentum in this currency pair. Now that recent moves are
confirming my long term Aussie short outlook as discussed previously
([#1][], [#2][], [#3][], [#4][]), my plan is to stay on the short
for the long haul. My target on this dive for the AUDUSD is down to
0.9000 corresponding to the long term support line of #2 in that list
above. Of course, prices don't go one way. So remember to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">manage
risks</a> and be prepared for some probable counter-trend moves. [caption

see that I've converted from shorting AUDJPY to shorting AUDUSD. The
simple reason is that USDJPY looks to have bottomed out and is on a run
upward. Thus, the US dollar has more potential strength than the yen to
go long. Lastly, as the title says, I also shorted AUDCAD at 0.9546 for
the long term. See Figure 3. That short is playing out nicely as well
with an [amazing long term bearish setup][#3]. [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Arguably the single most important skill a trader needs to master in
trading any market is to <strong>cut your losses short and let your profits
run</strong>. This is simply another saying of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">managing risks</a> and
maximizing opportunities. However, this is easier said than done. Ever
tried to cut your losses short but only to see the price run in your
favour soon afterward? Or, that you've built a sizable and profitable
position only to see it turn into a loss? As with much of other trading
skills, managing your trade is not an exact science. That is why you
need to have probabilities in your favour on every step. You enter a
trade because it is <em>likely</em> to be profitable. You exit a trade when it
is not. If you can apply this axiom on every trade you do, it is
<em>likely</em> that you will be profitable, with all things being equal. So
what does this have to do with cut your losses short and let your
profits run? In this post, I will discuss one <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy</a> which
I use to do exactly that. The key to this strategy is divide and
conquer. Instead of taking one trade for each position, consider taking
multiple smaller trades by scaling in and out of a position. That way,
you can have more freedom in your trade by using your position size to
your advantage. Here's the gist of the strategy and the rationale for
it. The rule is simple: increase a position by scaling in as the
probability of success increases; and decrease a position by scaling out
as the probability of success decreases. One way to do this is to add on
a position as the price breaks support on a faster timeframe. You keep
adding on this position as long as your trade setup (on a higher time
frame) is valid. At the same time, you limit your risk by <em>lowering the
stop</em> of your previous trade to breakeven. That way, even though you are
stockpiling a position, the overall risk stays the same. This is an
essential step in the technique. Otherwise the risk would just multiply.
It is as much managing the entries as well as the stops/exits. Let's put
this into perspective with a real-world example. Figure 1 shows the
support levels for my EUR/CHF short on a 3-hour chart. I identified this
trade using my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC setup</a> on the daily chart. The failed break above
1.4800 on January 14 was the signal for entry. I took an initial short
position risking 0.20% of my account as EUR/CHF reverted back below
1.4800 (first support, not marked). Then I kept adding on to this
position below 1.4787, 1.4761, and 1.4742 supports as shown in Fig. 1
with the horizontal dashed red lines. On each subsequent new entry, I
move the stop on the previous entry to b/e. I only risk 0.1% on each of
these additions with half the position size after the initial entry. As
I keep adding, I keep moving the stops one step behind. So on my third
scale-in, my initial stop have locked in some profits at a price level
between my first and second entries. Figure 2 is the same chart but with
the actual filled orders (yellow triangles) and current stops (red
lines) marked. As you can see, I have effectively accumulated a sizable
position size in this short while limiting my risk to just a fraction
(0.2% versus 1.0%) if I were to enter my maximum size all at once.
Furthermore, my confidence and probability of this trade increase
gradually as I see the short-term support levels break one after
another. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURCHF,
3-hour, showing supports"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-18-EURCHF_3h.PNG" />][][/caption] [caption id=""

First of all, this strategy is mostly suitable for trading setups with
an expected high reward/risk ratio. You might not want to use this for a
range trading strategy as there's probably not enough price move to
break the trade into steps. Secondly, this technique is mostly for an
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated system</a> or longer term manual strategies (hours or more).
Just so you have sufficient time to manage all these extra work without
adding on an unnecessary amount of stress. Lastly, an obvious downside
to this approach is that your account will take a hit from the spreads
and commissions for each move. So do take those costs into account in
building your own adaptation to this concept. Now that I've discussed my
scaling-in technique, what do you think? <strong>Update January 22:</strong> I've
closed this position and it turns out to be <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/closed-eurchf-and-gbpchf-shorts-best-trade-ever/">one of my best trade
ever</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>CAD/JPY failed a major resistance level at 90 and has edged out an
obvious intermediate-term downtrend (Fig 1). USD/CAD is also bouncing
off a major support at 1.0200 (Fig. 2). And crude oil is below \$80 on a
slippery slope. As such, shorting loonie seems like a good move at the
moment according to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC trading setup</a>. Yet, here is why I am
opting to short CAD/JPY and not long the more popular USD/CAD currency
pair. Figure 3 shows a 5-year, weekly chart of CAD/JPY (top) and USD/CAD
(bottom). Evidently, the exchange rate of CAD/JPY is still in a
depressed mode since the fall of September 2008. It's also clear on this
chart that why I say 90 is a major resistance level. Beside from being a
nice round number, CAD/JPY has failed to break above 90 twice since
August 2009. As for USD/CAD, the picture isn't as clear. 1.0200 is
definitely a very strong support because it marks the top of a 6-month
range in the first half of 2008. Yet, the downward slope in the long
term since 2005 is not to be ignored. As such, I do not dare to bet on a
bounce on this pair at this price. Moreover, the intermediate-term move
on both of these pair is giving us a confirmation. CAD/JPY is now
testing a falling trendling (Fig. 1). Whereas USD/CAD is testing a
falling support. Thus, I am shorting CAD/JPY under pressure. Going long
on USD/CAD now would be like betting it to bounce on a slippery slope.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
I write this as I am in my [first trading drawdown of 2010][]. As I said
[previously][first trading drawdown of 2010], I find that I am still
ill-trained to respond to big drawdowns. I caught myself over trading
again hoping to rake in a few quick paper bucks in my demo account to
get myself out. However, the ability to maintain discipline and
performance under stress is what separate the pros from newbies like me.
I know what I must do at the back of my head but I took the easy way.
This trading drawdown is definitely bringing the worst trader in me. As
Dr. Steenbarger wrote in his post on [Stress and Performance in
Trading][],

> "... one reason stress might affect performance among traders is by
> skewing their assessments of risk and reward. Under pressure, traders
> may narrow their cognitive scope to only the information most salient
> to them (availability bias) or relevant to their expectations
> (confirmation bias); focus only on superficial qualities of
> observations (representativeness heuristic); or become more likely to
> take profits than losses (disposition effect). In other words, stress
> disrupts performance by altering normal, sound information
> processing."

In addition to a narrowed mindset, the cause of my bad habit to over
trade during a big drawdown is that I subconciously associate the need
to recover my account balance with the need to trade. Nothing will
happen if you don't trade, right? Well, at least you won't lose anymore
than you have. That would have been a good start. So I considered to
ease back on trading by focusing on [my quant work][]. Then I realized
this is yet another misconception. I was merely walking away from my
problem. What I needed to do is to face it, not with mindless trading
though. **During a stressful drawdown, work harder and think plenty
about the market, *not* about recovering from your drawdown**. In the
mean time, only trade your best strategy to reap the best probability of
profits. At the end of the day, nobody can dig yourself out of an
account drawdown but you. Something must have been wrong with your
trading or your current perception of the market to get you in a
drawdown. Or, it could very well be just plain old bad luck. In any
case, take a step back from trading and use the opportunity to realign
yourself with the market or wait for market conditions to sync back with
you. This is a forgotten lesson that I have wrote about in a [previous
drawdown][]. I have since added an additional section in my [trading
rules][] to impose it upon myself with this re-ocurring problem. I can
never get rid of large drawdowns completely because they are a regular
part of trading. This particular one has been a great self-discovering
experience. Ultimately, learning to cope with trading under stress is
one of my top training priorities to achieve before moving on to trading
a live account with real money.

<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> endeavour. My account drawdown is at -3.34% now. My
record was set in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/november-2009-trading-performance-review/">last November</a> at -3.44%. And it's only the 13th!
To make matters worse, this isn't one of those transient, surprise
drawdown. It is a slow and steady one. An excruciating one. See Figure 1
for my account balance graph for this month so far. Feel my pain! My
post earlier this month on [10 questions to ask yourself if you are
holding a ginormous losing position and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what
to do][] was a real harbinger. I wrote that piece at precisely the top
point on Figure 1. If only I can time my trades that well! But instead
of a single ginormous losing position, I am faced with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">losing trades</a>
one after another. Thus, drastic measures need to be taken before I mark
a new drawdown record. This post is a self-assessment on what I've done
wrong and my plan to turn this wreck around. <!--more--> [caption id=""

apparent that my account suffered because I was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/early-bird-does-not-get-the-worm-in-forex-trading/">too eager in shorting
the Aussie</a>. As a standard <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a> procedure, I kick
started my emergency protocol when my drawdown reached 3.00% last week
as I <a href="http://twitter.com/Quantisan/statuses/7522778269">tweeted</a>. Basically just reducing my risk by trading with only
half the usual position size. That was all last week. This week, I found
myself breaking another of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">trading rules</a>. I am letting this
drawdown affect my trading, in a bad way. Specifically, I am letting my
need to perform affect me by starting to day trade the GBPJPY currency
pair! If you might recall from last year, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-example-of-how-trading-in-fear-is-bad-for-your-account/">resorted to the same
desperate measure</a> (isn't it great to be able to recall my past
trading experience just like that?) and that was the month when I had
the largest drawdown. Exactly because of that. In fact, the drawdown
emergency rules posted last time are as appropriate as ever. Heck, I
will copy and paste these rules in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules/">3 rules of trading</a> as a
permanent fixture. I seem to need them quite often. I can't helped but
feel chagrined with the fact that my current situation yields itself to
a perfect follow-up to my previous post on trading drawdown. However,
this is what it is. In my next post, I will examine why I keep going
back to this same bad habit of day trading (even though I suck at it)
when I am under pressure.</p>

consolidating now (Fig. 1). Crude oil tested 84 and is back down to just
above 83 now. Yet, AUDCAD is still struggling to break above 9600 (Fig.
2). You would have thought that AUDCAD should mustered enough momentum
to break above this key resistance with all these gold bullishness and
oil bearishness. Thus, I am giving this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audcad-0-9489-stop-9540/">AUDCAD short setup as described
previously</a> another try. I am only risking 0.16% on this trade. It is
half of my usual initial entry. First because it is a FTR (reversal)
setup and second because I am in a 3% drawdown. So my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk
manaegment</a> rules dictate that I trade halved size. This setup is
according to the monthly and weekly chart, so it could take a while, and
probably more tries, before it shows its hands. I will keep shorting it
as long as it's below 9600 on the weekly. Limited by the amount at risk
according to my risk management rules, of course!</p>
