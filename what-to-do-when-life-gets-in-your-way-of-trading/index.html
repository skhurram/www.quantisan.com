    </h1>

    <div class='article-content'>
        <p>Sometimes, things in life will get in the way of your trading. From down
with a cold to your internet service provider acting up, there are times
when your are not able to trade in your ideal zone. What do you do in
these disadvantaged circumstances? Do you take some NyQuil or whip out
your Blackberry, and then continue trading? This decision certainly
depends on the severity of your handicap and your trading
responsibility. If you have a massive open position with no stop, you'd
better suck it up and do something about it quick. For amateurs such as
myself with nobody to answer to but my own account, I would scale out of
my positions and then stop trading to focus on fixing my obstacle. I am
faced with this question recently and here's what I'm doing about it. I
have been practicing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> forex for the past few months
working out some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading signals</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">strategies</a> before going
live. During this time, I have become very fond of the 3-hour chart. My
strategy essentially boils down to making high-level decisions on the
weekly and daily charts, then executing my trades on the 3-hour and
1-hour charts. I've written specifically about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">my basic setup</a> and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">how I scale into a trade on the 3-hour timeframe</a>. This latter
technique, along with managing my stops, are the basis of my risk
management. So imagine the disruption to my perfect world when I was
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/barred-from-trading-at-work-a-curse-or-a-gift/">barred from trading at my day job</a> last month. The first step I took
is to adapt my trading strategy. I tried trading a longer timeframe so
that I don't have to move my orders every few hours. But the inability
to limit my risks is really getting to me. That was the best part of my
trading system and now I can't use it anymore. This is one big hole into
my trading strategy. So rather than continue on trading with a handicap,
I've decided to cast my trading aside to focus on remedying this problem
as soon as possible. Here are my 2 reasons for it.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are always opportunities in the market.</li>
<li>There is no handicap system in trading.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since my best trading system is effectively broken at this point, I
cannot perform as well as I should. Rather than compete with the rest of
the world in a handicapped state, it's better for me to ease back on
trading to put my effort to fixing my shortcomings. The longer I delay,
the more my demo account would be unnecessary exposed. In fact,
continuing to trade full force with a handicap would just be reckless
and arrogant. I am <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">just scrapping by</a> when I'm well. I can't imagine
how deep my drawdown would be if I trade without my best technique. Here
is my trading plan for the next few weeks. I will trade another strategy
using a longer timeframe. I will limit my risks and focus by holding at
most 2 positions at a time with maximum of 0.2% of account at risk for
each. The majority (about 70%) of my usual trading time will be spent on
learning <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/MQL4/">MQL 4</a> and developing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated risk management systems</a>.
That's the story of my problem and solution. What do you do when life
gets in your way of trading?</p>
