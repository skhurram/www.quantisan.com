            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R45YbfY4unI/AAAAAAAAAGs/qWpwUsnYojU/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][] Seemed like an obvious down day today with more write downs in
the news. WSJ is reporting inflation is at 17 year high. Boeing is also
delaying their 787 delivery. So many bad news indeed.</p>
<p>Yet, the Dow decides to be up today. The futures gapped lower, but it
was quickly closed to yesterday's close. I saw that one coming from the
CCI and Stoch and was able to profit on the brief rally. It seemed
obvious that the MM are positioning themselves for the big fall.</p>
<p>I exited the long and went short on very good timing. Then the market
went on a free fall for an hour. I was holding 2 shorts of YM (one for
long term entered at market top and another one for short term, which
was added on an early consolidation). The paper profit amounted to
almost \$1300 for that hour.</p>
<p>I found myself counting the profit and becoming ecstatic of the gain.
This is when my discipline lost to my conviction. CCI and Stochastic
were obviously turning upward. I originally intended the 2nd short
position to be short term only. If I stuck to my strategy, I should have
exited at least one position when the signals were staring at my face.</p>
<p>That was indeed the bottom for the day. The market recovered and
actually went higher. This is due to the HB&amp;B moving funds (gold, tech,
oil, etc) back into the financials. They are in fact
<span style="font-weight:bold;">rotating funds out of each sector</span>
one at a time so that the indexes don't tank too fast.</p>
<p>While I was so smart to call the first rally a fakeout, I totally forgot
the same could be done on the other end! It was a double trap!!! Fake
rally, fake fall, then finally settle near prev close. This is because
most "news" from today were already discounted in the previous few days'
drop in DJIA. Buy on rumour, sell on the news!</p>
<p>I continued to trade after the big lost hoping to recover. I kept on
going short near the top but the Dow kept breaking it. After a while, I
finally dawned on me. I went long on the bottom and made a little bit
back.</p>
<p>In the end, I was down about \$500 to \$600 on YM.</p>
<p>One thing I re-learned/realized is that the morning are amateurs'
market. The afternoon are the pro's market. At least, it seems easier to
trade because there seem to be less noise in the mornings for the past
few days. My strategy seemed to have worked better in the morning too.
I'll focus on the first hour or two of the market from now on and see if
this hypothesis is true.</p>

and then lost like \$28 points in 7 hours. Daily chart shows two tail
from past two days. Volume is also a higher today on a lower close.
Stochastic and MACD looks to be turning down.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could have waited til the morning to enter the position. The
60 min. chart shows the price is going up. So I could get a better
price. I'll wait this out and not watch the price so often since this is
suppose to be a long term trade. Target price is \$865, previous
consolidation. I'll add another position if it plays out well. We'll see
tomorrow. CPI is coming out in the morning.</p>

<li>day traded YM again, ended up about \$55 for the day with 4 trades.</li>
<li>Stochastic slow crossing oversold/bought line seems to be a pretty
    good indicator. I combined it with CCI smoothed and look at the
    underlying trend to catch retracements.</li>
<li>worked a bit on the system again, but the market changes too much,
    difficult to make a catch-all system that can be consistent. I will
    continue trading manually to gain experience.</li>
<li>installed the eKam Hesitation indicator</li>
<li>Examined swing trading soybean. My system seems to work well there
    too. But risk/reward only = 10, daily range / intraday range.
    Whereas YM's risk/reward is 20. But YM is more choppy lately and S
    is swinging well.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Lesson:</span> Don't focus on
    profit. Concentrate on managing risk and the money will follow.</li>
<li>Entered a short position of YM at \$897.10 with stop at \$902.6
    (just above resistance)</li>
</ol>
<p>Yesterday I was day trading too. Up about \$100. I've been working on
the system for the past couple of days, disappointing results. On the
other hand, I'm getting better at day trading and this seems like a
better method.</p> </div>

setup is to enter on retracements. From the above YM graph, see that the
price is in a downtrend already from the 50MA (gray dotted) below 200 MA
(white dotted) lines in plot1.</p>
<p>The first vertical line denotes setup #1 for the retracement shorting
opportunity. Note the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>price is just above Keltner Channel</li>
<li>CCI stopped rising from above 100</li>
<li>Stochastic Slow crossing below signal line</li>
</ol>
<p>The second vertical line denotes setup #2, which may be weaker because
of fewer indicators alerting.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stochastic Slow crossing below 80 and just crossed signal</li>
</ol>
<p>P.S. A 200/50 MACD Histogram could replace the 2-line MA's for easier
reading. And use slowing CCI as confirmation of Stochastic crossing 20
or 80.</p>
<p></p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Update:</span> This is actually a
reversal strategy and not retracement. Retracement shouldn't end up on
the other side of the Keltner channel. See <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reversal-with-stochastic-cci-and-keltner-channel-strategy/">this newer reversal strategy
for a new adaptation.</a></p>
