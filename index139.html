            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R45cF_Y4uoI/AAAAAAAAAG0/mSL5Cg4L4_w/s400/gold_day.jpg" />][] My short on gold last night was a good call. Gold today is
below \$880. After losing a bunch on the Dow, I entered another short
position on Gold at \$882.60 out of frustration. In my mind I thought
that was a short term top from retracement. In hindsight, it was a bad
spot to go short. The indicators were in the middle and price was
inching up. It's at \$887.20 at the moment. This emotional trade could
cost me dearly. I'll see how it turns out tomorrow.</p>
<p>Update: I entered 2 more shorts at \$880.50 when the retracement seemed
weak from the indicators. I now have a total of 4 shorts on YM! I am
taking a lot of risk here because with 4 contracts, each 10 point drop
would amount to \$1300! However, I strongly believe we are at a short
term top in Gold.</p>
<p>While people are still hoping this is just a minor correction before
newer highs, the bearish signals in the daily chart are just too clear
to not plunge in.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R46FNvY4urI/AAAAAAAAAHM/Zu0vdgpeJcU/s400/gold_daily.jpg" />][]Notice the volume of the last two down days. They are near
their high as in the November correction. MACD is also turning down from
a fierce run. Stochastic is below signal line and actually crossing 80
as of today. If I might say this again, what really got me is the high
volumes in the last two trading days.</p>
<p>The combinations of these signals, alone with the current position of
the price high above the Keltner channel, has always produced
significant falls in the past year. This time, the volume is ALSO
confirmation the signal. So my guess is that this will be a big
correction to come. Probably to \$800 or even below.</p>
<p>My 4 stops are set to just above intraday highs and pivot points. If
they all hit, I'll lose about \$1500. If this plays out, short term
price should be at least back down to 20 MA level (which is also the
triangle top) at \$850. My average price is \$885.1. So a potential
profit of about \$4500. Thus, reward/risk = \$4500 / \$1500 = 3. Which
is pretty good. That's why I convinced myself to take on so many
positions.</p>
<p>Anyway, tomorrow should be a telling day as it's the 3rd day since the
initial drop. We'll see if the price recover.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R45YbfY4unI/AAAAAAAAAGs/qWpwUsnYojU/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][] Seemed like an obvious down day today with more write downs in
the news. WSJ is reporting inflation is at 17 year high. Boeing is also
delaying their 787 delivery. So many bad news indeed.</p>
<p>Yet, the Dow decides to be up today. The futures gapped lower, but it
was quickly closed to yesterday's close. I saw that one coming from the
CCI and Stoch and was able to profit on the brief rally. It seemed
obvious that the MM are positioning themselves for the big fall.</p>
<p>I exited the long and went short on very good timing. Then the market
went on a free fall for an hour. I was holding 2 shorts of YM (one for
long term entered at market top and another one for short term, which
was added on an early consolidation). The paper profit amounted to
almost \$1300 for that hour.</p>
<p>I found myself counting the profit and becoming ecstatic of the gain.
This is when my discipline lost to my conviction. CCI and Stochastic
were obviously turning upward. I originally intended the 2nd short
position to be short term only. If I stuck to my strategy, I should have
exited at least one position when the signals were staring at my face.</p>
<p>That was indeed the bottom for the day. The market recovered and
actually went higher. This is due to the HB&amp;B moving funds (gold, tech,
oil, etc) back into the financials. They are in fact
<span style="font-weight:bold;">rotating funds out of each sector</span>
one at a time so that the indexes don't tank too fast.</p>
<p>While I was so smart to call the first rally a fakeout, I totally forgot
the same could be done on the other end! It was a double trap!!! Fake
rally, fake fall, then finally settle near prev close. This is because
most "news" from today were already discounted in the previous few days'
drop in DJIA. Buy on rumour, sell on the news!</p>
<p>I continued to trade after the big lost hoping to recover. I kept on
going short near the top but the Dow kept breaking it. After a while, I
finally dawned on me. I went long on the bottom and made a little bit
back.</p>
<p>In the end, I was down about \$500 to \$600 on YM.</p>
<p>One thing I re-learned/realized is that the morning are amateurs'
market. The afternoon are the pro's market. At least, it seems easier to
trade because there seem to be less noise in the mornings for the past
few days. My strategy seemed to have worked better in the morning too.
I'll focus on the first hour or two of the market from now on and see if
this hypothesis is true.</p>

and then lost like \$28 points in 7 hours. Daily chart shows two tail
from past two days. Volume is also a higher today on a lower close.
Stochastic and MACD looks to be turning down.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could have waited til the morning to enter the position. The
60 min. chart shows the price is going up. So I could get a better
price. I'll wait this out and not watch the price so often since this is
suppose to be a long term trade. Target price is \$865, previous
consolidation. I'll add another position if it plays out well. We'll see
tomorrow. CPI is coming out in the morning.</p>

<li>day traded YM again, ended up about \$55 for the day with 4 trades.</li>
<li>Stochastic slow crossing oversold/bought line seems to be a pretty
    good indicator. I combined it with CCI smoothed and look at the
    underlying trend to catch retracements.</li>
<li>worked a bit on the system again, but the market changes too much,
    difficult to make a catch-all system that can be consistent. I will
    continue trading manually to gain experience.</li>
<li>installed the eKam Hesitation indicator</li>
<li>Examined swing trading soybean. My system seems to work well there
    too. But risk/reward only = 10, daily range / intraday range.
    Whereas YM's risk/reward is 20. But YM is more choppy lately and S
    is swinging well.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Lesson:</span> Don't focus on
    profit. Concentrate on managing risk and the money will follow.</li>
<li>Entered a short position of YM at \$897.10 with stop at \$902.6
    (just above resistance)</li>
</ol>
<p>Yesterday I was day trading too. Up about \$100. I've been working on
the system for the past couple of days, disappointing results. On the
other hand, I'm getting better at day trading and this seems like a
better method.</p> </div>
