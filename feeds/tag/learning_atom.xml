According to Wikipedia,

&gt; tangential learning is the process by which some portion of people
&gt; will self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in something that they
&gt; already enjoy.

I was just organizing my bookshelf the other day and is surprised by how
fast my collection of statistics books have grown. I studied statistics
back in school as a stepping stone to learning stochastic process for
wireless communication theories (e.g. CDMA). Detecting radio-frequency
and resolving wireless signals to meaningful messages is fundamentally
about assessing the state of random processes. I hated statistics back
then because I didn't *get it* and did poorly in those courses. It is
ironic that years later I would realize how much I have grown to rely
and love the little *p*'s and *q*'s in my little hobby of quantitative
trading. I still don't like statistics (or theoretical math), per se. I
just love *applying* them in my trading and quant programs. The more
that I learn about statistics, the more that I realize how powerful they
can be and how ignorant I am. For example, in my clinical study days I
used either t-test or ANOVA for everything under the sun. Now that I've
come to understanding about inferential statistics, I am aware of the
assumptions and pitfalls such as the assumption of t-tests of
homogeneity of variance between the two samples tested. If this
assumption is violated, then the unequal variance t-test should be used.
Finer points like these are routinely ignored in practice because many
clinical studies are inherently designed in the experiment to meet these
criteria. However, that's not the case when I am making creative use of
statistics in my trading. I don't have a clinical study committee
watching over my back. If I make a false or weaker-than-expected claim
and don't know better, then it is my bank account that will suffer the
consequences. Learning statistics was initially due to this
got-to-know-better necessity. However, the more that I learn about
statistics, the more that I appreciate it. If used correctly, statistics
can provide a new dimension to the scientific assessment of your trading
performance and market data.
