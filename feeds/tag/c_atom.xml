We gapped up at the open, stayed in a
trading range for the day, then slowly rose up in the last hour, but
only to lose a small chunk and settled at 850, again. The volume has
been low throughout the day and the internals didn't look too good.
That's what prompted me to unload about half my positions in the last 45
minutes. The recent beating in my account certainly is making me being
very cautious now. I'd rather &lt;strong&gt;save my ammo to enter higher later when
we get confirmation for a rally than wait for one with bloated bullish
positions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the S&amp;amp;P 500, TICK, and Advance-Decline line. Aside from the
open gap up peak, both the TICK and A-D line failed to impress
throughout the day. Actually, it was lack of strength in the numerous
840 tests and the weak 850 breakout about 3:20 that worried me. Notice
the lower lows in both the TICK and A-D line at the 840 and 850
breakouts in the chart below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first to go was -90 DELL @ 9.90 at 3:25pm for about a 50% loss. I
[bought DELL at the beginning of October for \$16.49][] and it has been
underperforming throughout the two months. There's been little volume
since I bought, up or down. Even with the exuberant buying on the market
today, DELL failed to break above \$10 (it did close at \$10.14). Most
important reason for me selling this long term holding now is that
there's very little volume even on this up day when everyone's expecting
a real bear rally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, I sold my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/"&gt;C calls from the strangle placed Friday&lt;/a&gt;. As I
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-uyg-449/"&gt;said earlier in the day&lt;/a&gt;, the news that the FED is bailing out
Citigroup has rocketed its share price from \$3.17 at my time of
purchase to \$6.50 on the morning rush. However, C share price eased
down throughout the day and failed to break \$6 with high volume. I sold
at about \$6.05. I purchased the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/"&gt;+2 Dec 5 calls for \$0.79&lt;/a&gt; and sold them for \$1.77. This was a
speculative play and I didn't want to be greedy. So I sold when C share
price showed it's lacking steam to continue to move up ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_888" align="aligncenter" width="500"

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I sold my [+2 ABB Dec 10 calls purchased at \$1.55][] for
\$1.70. A breakeven trade after commission. The drawdown was humongous
in this trade since I have &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/"&gt;missed some previous stops&lt;/a&gt;. The ABB share
price action is a lot like DELL today, a lot of fireworks but no real
substance. Yes, the price is up a lot today, but there's no volume from
it. In particular, in the last 15 minute, ABB dived back down to its
major pivot point of \$11.10. I quickly unloaded my calls then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_889" align="aligncenter" width="500"

&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else, I am really hoping for a good bear rally. It would
do everyone, both bears and bulls, some good at this point. The thinking
is, after so many fake rallies lately, this one has to be it, right?
However, having learned my lesson in bottom picking in this bear market,
I'm putting my hope/logic aside and interpret what I see in front of me.
From today's price and volume movement, this rally doesn't seem like it
will follow through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hope I'm wrong though, if we can hold the 845/840 level on the
S&amp;amp;P500 tomorrow. Then I would be looking to add to my already 60% long
holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup is all over the news today. NYT:&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/business/21finance.html?ref=business"&gt;Citigroup Tries to Stop the
Drop in Its Share Price&lt;/a&gt; and FT:&lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c5cd6378-b7fe-11dd-ac6d-0000779fd18c.html"&gt;Citi board locked in talks as shares
dive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After failing to retake \$10 earlier in the week, C share price has gone
vertical. Since Citigroup is in-play in the market this week, this is a
great time to buy an options &lt;a href="http://www.theoptionsguide.com/long-strangle.aspx"&gt;strangle&lt;/a&gt; to capitalize on this
volatility. The bet here is that Citigroup would go down in flames or it
would rise back from the dead. This position will breakeven if C goes
below \$0.88 or above \$6.62. Given that C was at \$10 just days ago,
moving from \$3.44 as of now to beyond either of those range seems
viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upside: Lots of talk about C at the moment. The stock is in-play. High
volatility is what the options strangle feed off by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance: \$5, we could bounce around the \$5 range&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downside: High volatility so options premium is expensive. The
volatility might be factored in the price already, so this \$0.88 to
\$6.62 range could be a trading range for C until expiry next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support: errr... \$0?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: This is a hedged play. I can profit if C goes up or down.
Given the extent of the situation with Citigroup, I think it's highly
likely we would break this range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possible folding of Citigroup is creating another wave of panic on
the market today. As the second biggest bank in America, this is unlike
the collapse of Lehman, WaMu, Fannie and Freddie. While the previous
institutions are also gigantic financial institutions and an integral
part of the financial system, Citigroup is different because it's a part
of the daily lives of many Americans. While I am not an economist, but I
am a consumer. I &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; feel this is psychologically a bigger
deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, is this a time to panic? Perhaps. But from a trader's
standpoint, I think we would be a little too late now. In hindsight,
anyone would have wished to unload the financials back in 2007. But who
am I kidding, I definitely don't have that foresight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do notice though, is that the failed retest of \$10 for C last
Friday and this Monday was a pretty good sign that C is going down. A
failed retest of the \$8.5 level on Tuesday and Wednesday was a
confirmation. I tried to &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-325/"&gt;short C&lt;/a&gt; then but was &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-350/"&gt;stopped out&lt;/a&gt;.
Frankly, I didn't think it would be &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; bad (my target was \$7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Citigroup and the market continued to decline at an
accelerated pace. Rather this is simply a case of correlation or
causality is unknown by me. It doesn't matter. The point is, even an
amateur like me saw C to be going down on Wednesday. Do you think the
professionals would have missed it? Wouldn't they know already C would
be &lt;em&gt;going down in flames&lt;/em&gt;? And probably months ago too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's good to assume that the current panic on Citigroup trading
below the magical \$5 has been factored in the market already. So am I
saying we'll be making a reversal soon? Not really. C trading below \$5
is one thing, but there's also the bigger picture we should consider.
Would this trigger a new leg of this bear run due to a vicious spiral of
panic? Don't forget, we have recently &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-breakdown-of-a-major-multi-year-support-are-we-going-down-and-i-mean-really-down/"&gt;broken some multi-year
supports&lt;/a&gt;. This leg of the market downturn &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/pre-market-analysis-for-november-21-2008/"&gt;still haven't eased off
yet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes we may be going down, but I believe the time for panic was over,
this is a time for finding values and positioning yourself for the
longer term (hey, it has to go up &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; time, right?). I wouldn't dare
short this market though, even a target of 600 on the S&amp;amp;P is just 150
points away, but look at the S&amp;amp;P chart on any time frame and you can see
the vast green pasture to the upside. The risk/reward potential just
isn't that good for a short here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe I have learned my lesson. There is no profit in calling for
bottoms. I will wait for the market to play it out and watch the price
action for entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that was fast. This trade lasted only 36 minutes. I [shorted for
\$3.25][] and was stopped out for \$3.50. A lost of \$40 with
commission. I dumped my holding when my stop was hit this time. No
question asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market rallied fast in the last 20 minutes to close at 858.82 for
S&amp;amp;P 500. Let's see how the market does tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going long haven't been working out for me. So I'm going to stick in a
short side trade to hedge my long positions. I chose Citibank because
it's the obvious. It's a financial, and it just reported a massive 20%
cut to its workforce. While that's good news in the long run and I
typically go against the media, that strategy haven't worked well.
That's why I'm going for the blatantly obvious this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TICK just marked a new high for the day but we're merely testing a
local resistance. The downside seems more and more possible now. That's
why I want to hedge my longs at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upside: Quadriple bottom forming. The company is accepting reality and
putting in efforts to minimize future downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance: \$9.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downside: We are spiralling down. Continued market weakness seen in
intraday data, Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support: \$8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: This trade is opposite of my usual strategy. Going short at
a major support level is very risky. Yet, doing what i normally do
hasn't worked for the past two weeks. So I'm just going to go with the
flow and try a short side position to hedge my positions. As this is a
Nov call, this is a short term trade with a stop of C share price
\$8.40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great close today. Notice that we're testing the 910/920 (S&amp;amp;P/SPY)
resistance with significant volume in the last hour of the day. The
volume is more than the level established at the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same can be said of BAC and JPM. C's end-of-day volume didn't break
through. Recall that these are the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-sign-this-financial-bloodbath-is-ending-soon/"&gt;3 banks I said to watch for in last
week's CDS crisis&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Lehman's CDS settled without much
fanfare. See Lehman CDS settlement of \$5.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect tomorow morning (was going to say 'day', but who knows these
days) to follow through with today's action. We'll see if we can close
the week higher for a triple-bottom, with 3 long tails, on the daily
chart. In particular, I'd like to see if we can break &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-down-of-this-weeks-trading-range/"&gt;above 940 for the
close as I have opined previously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Why? Here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In Bill Cara's commentary today, he opines about the [rationale for the
current market crash][] (not the one last week, but this week).

&gt; Why the panic bail-outs? The answer lies in the \$55 trillion dollar
&gt; Credit Default Swap market that is unraveling day to day. Banks and
&gt; central banks are totally focused on the breaks to the credit ring
&gt; when up to \$400 billion of Lehman Brothers CDS obligations come due
&gt; in the next week, with nobody at the teller window to pay up. Lehman
&gt; Brothers is, as you know, bankrupt.
&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What this means is that unspecified banks holding the Lehman CDS
derivatives will get nothing, and then they will be unable to meet
their obligations to other banks. At stake are the Money Market Funds
on deposit in these banks. The entire system could collapse, so banks
do not want to be in the position of lending to one another. The
credit market has failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill suggests that we look at the 3 biggest banks in the world (total
over 90% of CDS market) for the first signs of when the market will tank
further. Because, well... if they can't pull through this mess, we are
really doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
So here's where my own analysis comes in. Besides Bill's rationale, we
know the current crisis is caused by the collapse of the financial
market. So I've been looking at the financial heavyweights in any case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough talk, let's look at the market today. After the failed attempt of
a rally earlier this week, the market is widely expected to continue
spiral down. It has. And the media is certainly not short of fueling the
panic. See: Worries over economy spread; global markets sink and
&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122411376471138395.html?mod=todays_us_nonsub_page_one"&gt;Economic Fears Reignite Market Slump&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;em&gt;what everyone knows
isn't worth knowing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only information traders should listen to though, is the price data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was saying, based on yesterday's end-of-day move, the market is
expected to tank today, at least this morning. If we focus on the 3
banks, we can see they have broken yesterday's end-of-day low and are
testing the Monday lows. However, this is the key, their 15 min volume
on today's low is below yesterday's last 15 min when the prices dived.
All of their prices are testing their lows on lower volumes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;strong&gt;I believe the selling is drying up&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean we'll be shooting up from here? Perhaps. But this is a
very good sign. I would wait until the next significant daily move
(either up or down) and watch the quality of the action before making
any monetary committment in this crazy market.&lt;/p&gt;
