Holding
time was just a day. I would have liked to hold this position for longer
but the market is directionless. In addition, the stop hunt on the
shorts in LLL.TO is unmistakable as seen in Figure 1. Option expiration
is this Friday. So I'm taking my profit now prior to expected
volatility. A reward/risk of 2 to 1 is too tempting to let go. However,
LLL.TO is pushing higher into the close. So perhaps this is yet another
lack of patience on my part. Update Nov 18: Yes, I was too early indeed.
LLL.TO gapped upward the day after my exit. Option pain is pegged at
\$45 on the American shares (NASDAQ:LULU). LULU is trading just above
\$47 as I close my position. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

(\$48.00 - \$47.04) * 200 = \$192 - \$9.90 commission = \$182.1 = 1.9%
of account. It's fortunate that I'm able to bounce right back to regain
most of my losses in &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/covered-4-mfc-11jan-puts-14-00-mx-0-45-mark-14-80-loss-2-3/"&gt;my worst trade this year&lt;/a&gt; within a week.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="exit"></category><category term="LLL.TO"></category><category term="RRSP"></category></entry><entry><title>Bought 200 LLL.TO @ 47.04, Stop 46.50</title><link href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-200-lllto-4704-stop-4650/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-11-16T12:14:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Paul Lam</name></author><id>tag:www.quantisan.com,2010-11-16:bought-200-lllto-4704-stop-4650/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Market is tanking (Figure 1). Lots of pessimism in the news. Time for me
to load on some growth stocks. I'm passing the goldminers in this move
as the dollar seem to be rising from the dead and gold may be
consolidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TSX, 12500 looks
like a fine support, doesn't it?"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-11-16-TSX.png" /&gt;][][/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I'm picking a growth stock, Lululemon (LLL.TO). Lululemon is
holding well in this down move. Furthermore, the intraday test of
support at 46.50 looks promising as there were few sellers at that price
level. The recent break above long-term resistance at 48 is good too. So
is the 19.6% short float... Anyway, you get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

\$108 + \$9.90 commission = \$117.9 = 1.2% of account. Update:
Woodshedder's post today explains &lt;a href="http://ibankcoin.com/woodshedderblog/2010/11/15/the-sky-is-falling/"&gt;his current view of the market&lt;/a&gt;,
which happens to coincide with mine at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

LLL.TO is testing its recent high
at \$40.50. However, volume is rather low up to now. I'm out my
Lululemon (LLL.TO) position because of market softness. Bonds (TLT) are
holding a support level. EUR/USD is struggling to hold above 1.27. And
the oversea markets (Asia and Europe) are weak overnight. Perhaps the
market is getting ready to catapult up. Perhaps it is not. But I'm not
going to place my bet on anything as I don't have a clue where it's
about to go at the moment. So I am stopping out of this position at
breakeven. Preserving capital. Moreover, recent price move in Lululemon
(LULU on Nasdaq) is disappointing. Despite the market marking new
consecutive highs for the past few days, LLL is stuck in a rut as shown
in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Lululemon

&lt;p&gt;Purchase price of these shares were &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-140-lll-to-39-86/"&gt;\$39.86 from a week ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exact return is (\$40 - \$39.86) * 140 = \$19.60 - \$9.90 commission =
\$9.70. In any case, I'm all cash in my account now. At least I've free
myself from the market for the next two weeks during my trip to Hong
Kong. Here's an updated view of the daily chart of LLL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Lululemon

indicator of Figure 1. We are seeing a positive divergence from the
upticking companies above 50-dma/200-dma ratio (solid line in main
graph) and the lower low on the TSX. Furthermore, TSX index price has
been holding a longer term support at 11000 despite a new recent low on
the number of companies above their respective 200 day moving average
(top indicator) . The CDNV to TSX ratio is also showing a similar
positive divergence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Toronto
Composite (\$TSX)"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-TSX.png" /&gt;][][/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I am taking a bullish step with a cautious long position in
Lululemon (LLL.TO). There's a strong uptrend in this one as shown in
Figure 2. \$37.50 looks like a long term support. However, my stop is
\$38-\$39 zone to be in sync with the market move. Also, the gap to
\$37.50 support has been closed previously already in May, so a second
re-test wouldn't bold well for LLL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Lululemon
Athletica (LLL.TO)"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO.png" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO.png"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the chart, LLL currently has an enormous 22.79% short
floats according to &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/finviz/"&gt;Finviz&lt;/a&gt;. It is 70.51% owned by the big money with
a 3.72% increase in holding in the last quarter. Short squeeze, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took timed my entry based on intraday chart Figure 3. The top gap
today held for the first hour at least and then there were some
increased volume at the intraday support. I entered then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="LLL.TO intraday
chart"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO-intra.gif" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO-intra.gif"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, LLL touched \$40 and is now retraced below \$39.50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mental stop is \$39.00 and my hard stop is \$38.50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a risk of (\$38.50 - \$39.86) * 140 = \$190.40 + \$9.90
commission = \$200.30 = 2.13%.&lt;/p&gt;
