&lt;p&gt;I've sold my [CAF position bought at \$28.89][] for \$21.69. A loss of
about \$430. I placed a limit order, and only 56 of the 58 went through.
I'll assume my 2 remaining shares will go through some time today (it
has gone through as I'm writing this). Fee \$5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAF gapped open about \$2 today due to this weekend's news of [China's
plan for a stimulus package of about US\$586 billion][]. However, CAF
seem to be being faded on this news. The total downtick volume looks
significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, FXP (UltraShort China) looks to be on the rise. A
break of above \$70 would be very bullish for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bullish view on China in the long term still remains strong. However,
I don't think we're in a time for buy-and-hold strategy anymore. This is
definitely a trader's market and I intend to put my money for swing
trading opportunities. Even though I sold at a significant loss and a
return of CAF to \$25 level seems likely in the short term, I believe I
will lose even more in opportunity cost if my fund is tied with CAF. So
I'm exiting on this weekend news and price strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-down-of-this-weeks-trading-range/"&gt;Like the market&lt;/a&gt;, my holdings are going sideway this week near their
lows. Based on the price/volume observation this week, here's my
short-term ranking from strong to weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ESLR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DELL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CAF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SLW&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel ESLR is strongest because of the last hour spike last Friday on 1
million+ volume. They are now sueing Barclays and Lehman to return their
30.9 million loaned shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
DELL is showing some resilience despite negative news on Yahoo today. It
is testing its low the 2nd time at end-of-day today on a regular
late-day volume. The next day or two will be important times for DELL in
the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAF is just drifting sideway for now on low volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SLW is now under pressure because of weakness in precious metals and the
Euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="CAF, DELL, ESLR, SLW" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/2008-10-21-positions.png?w=500" title="2008-10-21-positions" /&gt;]: http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/2008-10-21-positions.png&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="CAF"></category><category term="DELL"></category><category term="ESLR"></category><category term="SLW"></category></entry><entry><title>Positions review after the crash in first week of October 2008</title><link href="http://www.quantisan.com/positions-review-after-the-crash-in-first-week-of-october-2008/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-10-15T10:30:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Paul Lam</name></author><id>tag:www.quantisan.com,2008-10-15:positions-review-after-the-crash-in-first-week-of-october-2008/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_375" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="CAF, DELL, ESLR, SLW"][&lt;img alt="CAF, DELL, ESLR, SLW" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/2008-10-15-holdings.png?w=500" title="2008-10-15-holdings" /&gt;][][/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/eslr-testing-long-term-low/"&gt;review my positions as promised last week&lt;/a&gt;. After the
record up day on Monday and then the lackluster follow-through Tuesday,
today is probably going to be a down day in the markets. Given &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/mid-week-market-review-october-15-2008/"&gt;my
intermediate term outlook&lt;/a&gt;, I am inclined to hold my positions.
However, I need to unload my weakest link to reduce my risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a quick snapshot of my current holdings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that DELL and ESLR are holding on nicely on this down (DJX
-3.18%, SPX -3.57% as of this writing) day after the previous spike.
This is a very good sign indeed as it shows they're likly to hold on to
the previous \~20% gain, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the price action of ESLR seem very healthy in particular.
There's been a couple of big volume spikes in late day trading. Although
it does seem to be in a constant downtrend, as you can see from its
chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for CAF and SLW they are both below support at the moment. CAF has
broken its \$25 support last Friday and is trading below it at the
moment. SLW is definitely the weakest at the moment. If it isn't such a
cash cow, I would probably be selling it in yesterday's rally.
Furthermore, it still seems to be holding on to its decending support
line on the daily chart today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_377" align="aligncenter" width="500"

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the question I ask myself is, if I'm in all cash now,
would I be buying these companies at this point? CAF - yes, DELL - yes,
ESLR - yes, SLW - yes. Is this the bottom? I don't know. I'll just have
to wait and see. However, I will watch the day-to-day action of my
holdings carefully and unload one of two of them to reduce my risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is suppose to be another of my GTC limit order before leaving to
Taiwan. I've set the buy order at \$25.0 on 25th. I got back on the 30th
(29th EST) and CAF looked strong. So I wanted to replace my \$25 bid to
\$26... However, I wasn't careful and the trading platform changed the
limit price to the market ask without me realizing until I placed the
order. Of course, then the order was filled and I got in at \$28.89,
higher than I would have wanted. I thought of exiting the position
immediately, at a small lost, but decided against it because I felt CAF
is going strong. I didn't need to pick the bottom and I was never good
at that anway. So I chose to stick with this entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what do ya know, that afternoon, the [US House decided to reject the
\$700-billion rescue plan][]. DJIA tanked 777 points that day and the
financials were hit the hardest of course. My \$26 bid would have seemed
like an ingeneous entry as CAF hit a low of \$25.11 that day. However, I
wouldn't have guessed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the high amount of volume at the low and near the end of the
trading day, I doubt we will see that price any time soon for CAF. \$25
is definitely a strong support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upside: Daily chart still looks good. Financials are in severe panic
mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance: A downward trendline is capping recent highs. \$30 round
number looks like the high end of trading range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downside: Possible turn to bearish from indicators. Financials earnings
coming soon, the numbers aren't gonna be pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support: \$26 looks like the bottom of the trading range we're in now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom Line: CAF has weathered the Dow 777 day drop with style. It has
shown strength at the worst of times. However, don't expect a steady
climb from here. At this market's condition, anything is possible (i.e.
more panic days in the coming weeks and CAF would be thrown out along
with the financials again). I don't think this is to be a buy and hold
position yet. So watch for breakouts either way and be ready to trade in
and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note, if I have more funds, I'd rather be scaling in CAF on
the lows for the long term instead of swing trading for a few bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sold all my CAF @ \$32.35 (fee \$5) for a sizable gain ([in at
\$24.02][]) in just a few days. And 20%+ in today alone! The price
bounced back right at the 50 dma. Furthermore, there's a lot of talk
about the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122182746619856569.html?mod=article-outset-box"&gt;central banks saving the financials&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122181849785156423.html?mod="&gt;DJIA moved about 900
points in past two days already&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, today is a &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/today-is-quadruple-witching-day/"&gt;quadruple
witching Friday&lt;/a&gt;, so I don't want to leave the gain on the table with
the expected volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I've stuck to [my target][in at \$24.02] of leaving at
about \$30 and/or when the price spikes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upside: News #1:&lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e91b24b6-8557-11dd-a1ac-0000779fd18c.html"&gt;Central banks act to calm markets&lt;/a&gt; (financials go
up). News #2: &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7897f396-8583-11dd-a1ac-0000779fd18c.html?nclick_check=1"&gt;China steps in to prop up stocks&lt;/a&gt; (China go up). And
CAF chart looks good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance: \$25 from 2 days ago, then \$30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downside: It's a financial! And investment bank at that! No telling what
mass panic could cause...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support: \$22.25 from 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom Line: With the mass fear in Financials (doom's day-like media
headlines here in Hong Kong), I believe we're near for a short squeeze
rally in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target: Some kind of big spike. I'll sell into strength. Or \$30. I do
want to hold this for a few weeks if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop: 2 day consecutive close below \$22 and fade out of buy signals.
Gotta watch this one close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fee: \$5.00&lt;/p&gt;
