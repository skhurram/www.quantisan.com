latest global financial debacle, I am suddenly awashed with a feeling of
hopelessly powerless to this gross unfairness. In which the average,
hard working citizens are pouring money into the pockets of the filthy
and uber rich. If you don't know what I'm talking about here, watch the
video attached below for the tip of the ice berg in this on-going
problem. While Goldman is arguably the best at "legalized stealing" from
the moms and pops, they aren't the only crook on the block. Governments
around the world (not just the U.S.) were handing out money publicly
left and right in the past few months. And many still are. The whole
system is rigged as &lt;a href="http://www.caracommunity.com"&gt;Bill Cara&lt;/a&gt; has opined countless times in the last
few years. Bill's ingenious move to relocate his operation to the
Bahamas is only starting to shine in these months (to me). In addition
to voting with your ballot (which is useless if the whole system is
rigged), we can vote with our tax money by relocating our financial
operation. However, for those of us that still rely on a day job, this
is not an option. The best I can do right now is to become adequate with
managing our own money instead of depending on the financial salesmen.
This doesn't seem enough for me as the balance of power appears to be
getting worse by the day. Our government grossly tax us on one hand and
hand them out to the rich and well connected in the other. What have
others done/plan to do with regard to this unfair trap us working bees
are stuck in? The first video is Ratigan explaining how Goldman Sachs
made \$3 billions in 3 months (tipped by Stop Investing blog). The
second video is an interview with Michael Moore and Ratigan about where
all these loots are going now.&lt;/p&gt;

even farther up in this run before the final flush down. Here're my
reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. We have touched the 38% Fibonacci retracement level precisely last
week and have been making higher lows. See Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. As I noted in the morning, the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/end-of-month-review-march-is-bear-rally-month/"&gt;up days have noticeably more volumes
than the down days&lt;/a&gt; in this rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. My two favourite shorts, &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/"&gt;GE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-gs-100-apr-09-105-put-955/"&gt;GS&lt;/a&gt;, are resisting to stay
below their supports. In particular, Figure 2 shows that even in today's
swinging moves, they closed above their intra-day supports at noon while
the S&amp;amp;P 500 broke its intraday support at noon, just barely. In fact,
today's move look a lot like &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-277-tck-487/"&gt;TCK when it retraced&lt;/a&gt; (and when I
unloaded), just to punch through to much higher later. If that's any
indication, these two (and the market) will be breaking their long term
resistances within days.&lt;/p&gt;

This gap down today only attracted some light volume. And we're hitting
the support of \$100. Light volume on a test of a strong support isn't
good. So I'm lightening my short here since I still have my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/"&gt;GE
strangle&lt;/a&gt; to live off of in case we're tanking further as I suspect.
Call me chicken, but &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/goldman-sachs-is-it-up-or-is-it-down/"&gt;this position is a bit too heavy&lt;/a&gt; to be
comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

level. I entered my short on Monday when GS was about \$106.50. [Having
regretted it that very day as GS launched vertical upward near the close
to above \$110][]. Then yesterday, &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/goldman-sachs-fooling-around-110/"&gt;GS threw a fit and made wild swings
up and down&lt;/a&gt;, only to close near its open. Today, GS retraced more but
managed to crawl its way out of a hole back to \$112.95. Just above the
support of \$110, again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a historic 7% a day rally on Monday, this shallow pullback of both
GS and the broad market is a textbook bullish signal staring me in the
face. I can't help but feel we're going to explode upward soon. This
could very well be [THE full-blown, back-up-the-cash-truck bear rally
I've been expecting all year][]. And yet, I'm net short in my portfolio
...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly wanted to get out of this short today and go long. As I was
saying in the last update, I've marked my mental stop at \$115, its
recent peak. But we never saw that price again. So even though
emotionally I want out, I don't have a logical reason to ditch and
switch yet. So, the waiting game continues.&lt;/p&gt;

[I said I would unload it if GS
manage to stay above \$110][]. But it closed at \$110.60 yesterday. I
can live with a \$0.60 difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched GS for most of the day yesterday. It's action above \$110 seem
a bit lackluster. Looking at the chart, particularly the daily, you can
see the sword-like candlestick from yesterday. There's probably a name
for it, but I don't remember. Add to that, S&amp;amp;P500 just tested 820
resistance yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GS's move above \$110 is certainly interesting. The correct play would
be for it to break below \$110 and then observe the pullback, then if
it's weak, that would have been the right time to pound on the short
selling button. Or we could just buy a strangle at this point...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I entered pre-maturely on Monday, I'm going to wait this out
because the risk/reward ratio is still very high. At least now I know
\$115 would be my stop and my potential loss.&lt;/p&gt;

I entered a
short at 10:42am today thinking the gap up is unsustainable. Well, not
only has S&amp;amp;P500 broken 800, it's now resting above 820. Goldman Sachs
(GS) was about 106.50 when I entered the short. GS closed at 111.93
today. I'm down \$210 already. If GS can stay above this 200 day MA at
\$110 later tomorrow, then I'm out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, GS went vertical upward once it broke the morning
resistance at \$17.30. The reason for my entry in the morning was
because GS seemed like it was having difficulty breaking \$17.
Furthermore, S&amp;amp;P 500 also seemed hesitant around 800. So I guessed it'd
be reasonable to see a pullback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I failed to take into account today's humongous gap up open. It
would have been counter-productive if we're to close the gap on the
weekend's hype up. This is pretty much a reverse of what we've seen
seeing for the past few months. Panic begets panic. But in today's case,
it's panic of missing the rally train that'll fuel this possibly new leg
of a rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second mistake is trading on lack of information. I traded using the
mobile platform and by just looking at the Google Finance charts. If I
had access to my intraday sentiment chart, I could have easily seen that
the morning momentum remained strong even when S&amp;amp;P was stalling around
800.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I really should stick to &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/market%20analysis/"&gt;my own analysis&lt;/a&gt; and not trade on a
spontaneous urge. I did say in the morning that &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/beginning-of-another-bull-phase-asian-markets-are-on-fire/"&gt;we'll break down if we
fail to maintain 800&lt;/a&gt;. Even at the time of my short entry, we were
indeed holding on to the 800 zone. Thus, I have basically shot myself in
the foot for not listening to myself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="entry"></category><category term="GS"></category><category term="market analysis"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Weekly Review: March 17, 2009</title><link href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-weekly-review-march-17-2009/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-03-17T16:11:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Paul Lam</name></author><id>tag:www.quantisan.com,2009-03-17:market-weekly-review-march-17-2009/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week's market reacted as planned. We held the S&amp;amp;P500 680 support
level on Monday and shot up from there throughout the week. This &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-weekly-review-march-7-2009/"&gt;750 -
800 level as discussed before&lt;/a&gt; could form a trading range for the next
few days. However, note that both the S&amp;amp;P index and Goldman Sachs (GS)
are testing the downtrend resistance at 800 and 100 respectively. GS in
particular failed to reach 100 again on declining daily volume. This is
a pretty bad sign. (JPM, C, and BAC looks similar to GS, in that they
are showing a short term double top)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we fail to keep this momentum going up, I see a pullback to 720 to be
very possible. And if we're to fail to keep the 720 support, 670 would
be next, and then 600 as I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-weekly-review-march-7-2009/"&gt;suggested in last week's review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, the reason I'm using GS in particular as a leading
indicator is because we're, obviously, in a financial crisis, so like a
house of cards, the [market is only as strong as the weakest link in

Then I
decided against it because there's no action in the market and no good
confirmation. My 50% long, 25% short, and 25% cash distribution seems
alright for now. But Figure 1 below leads me to want to add more to the
short side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 1, the market is still clearly in a downtrend.
Moreover, we are at the top end of the channel. So shorting at this
point has a good risk/reward ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I was saying, I'd rather wait for GS to break the triangle first
before making a move. With the current market, it's &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/auto-bailout-shakeout-december-13-2008/"&gt;better to be late
