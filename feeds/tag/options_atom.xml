EUR/USD is bouncing off a long term support around 1.3600. Thus I'm
covering my short in Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) before the weekend.
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/story-of-a-bad-trade-and-a-missed-opportunity/"&gt;This position turned out horribly&lt;/a&gt;. I've been waiting for MFC.TO to
print 14.50, just above its 38.6% Fibonacci retracement level at 14.40
on the recent spike. But 14.80 doesn't seem to budge even today with all
that bearishness floating around. Intraday volume is also decreasing on
every new test of this intraday support. So I'm throwing in the towel
here. Loss is (\$0.45 - \$0.93) * 4 * 100 = -\$192 - \$27.90 =
-\$219.90 = -2.3% of account.&lt;/p&gt;

It is confirmed
by EUR/USD's rise and treasury's gap down (TLT) today. I'm not going to
argue with the market. So I am ditching my short for Manulife Financial
(MFC.TO) while it is still testing its 13.00 resistance at the open.
12.60 is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level for MFC. It made a textbook
perfect bounce on it (Fig. 1). Also, it's Friday today, so I'd rather
not have the time decay eat more out of my premium by holding over the
weekend. Loss for this trade is (\$1.74 - &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-jan-2010-puts-14-00-1-70-mark-13-25/"&gt;\$1.70&lt;/a&gt;) * 100 * 4 = \$16

This time on Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) with a
January 2011 put at 14 strike price. MFC is trading at \$13.25 at time
of entry. Recent series of &lt;a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-bank-story-no-one-is-talking-about-2010-09-10"&gt;prop desk closings&lt;/a&gt; isn't going to bode
well for the market, particularly for the banks as they need to
recuperate those easy income. On top of it, the lack of push from the
bulls this week as S&amp;amp;P test 1110 resistance doesn't look promising
either. Yet, this could very well be a bear trap. In any case, I am
taking a bearish bet via shorting MFC. Figure 1 shows a chart of MFC. It
is depressed and it is struggling. Moreover, MFC keeps announcing
billions of dollars worth of share offerings lately. I like it. There is
a distinct possibility of a bear raid if MFC can break this \$13.50
resistance level. The gap above \$15 is just staring at me. Hard stop is
at \$1.00 premium. Worst case risk for this trade is thus (\$1.70 -
\$1.00) * 4 * 100 = 280 + \$27.90 commission = \$307.90 = 3.2%.
However, I'd be very cautious if MFC closes above \$13.50. [caption

Of the few commodities that I
follow, silver looks to be weakest (Figure 2). Thus, I look for a short
based on silver. I chose Pan America Silver Corp. (PAA.TO) because it
looks to be the weakest of the silver miners (Figure 3). In particular,
referring to Figure 3, I highlighted the current price moves versus six
months ago. The price movements in the two boxes look similar. Thus I am
looking for a big dive in PAA soon with these puts options. I entered
today as PAA is testing its \$24.80 resistance. Next resistances are
\$25.00 (the gap) and \$25.15 (38% Fib level in the July dive). As such,
there are a couple of safety cushions in case this doesn't work out. My
mental stop is \$1.30 on the premium. Through time decay (around October
if we trade sideway from now), price appreciation, and mostly a
combination of these two factors. I figured I have about a month's time
to find out if it can break the \$25.15 level. Risk is thus (\$2.27 -
\$1.30) * 100 * 3 = \$291 + \$25.90 commission = \$316.90 = 3.3%. Once
again, that's higher than what I'd recommend. But that's just the worst
case scenario. We should know soon enough if silver can break lower as
it is trading against a descending trendline as shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

This is not good for my options as the time delta will slowly eating
away my premium. So I've decided to unload this position at a small loss
just now as the market is testing support across the board. The U.S.
dollar index is testing \$86 resistance. Oil is testing \$78 support.
S&amp;amp;P500 is testing the 1070 support zone. Purchase price for these puts

\$20 - \$13.95 * 2 commission = \$47.90 = 0.5% of account. As you can
see, the commission is horrible on my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/"&gt;RRSP trading account at
Questrade&lt;/a&gt;. I will wind down trading options from now on and move back
to trading forex in the summer. My live account at &lt;a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/"&gt;Dukascopy&lt;/a&gt; is
ready... Update: The market finally broke support the day after this

support on June 29th opening hour and I don't expect it to hold. This
could turn out to be a winner if I had held.&lt;/p&gt;

on the bears as oil (DBO) has already cracked. I waited the whole week
for a retracement to re-enter a short position. I thought the FOMC
announcement today could produce some sort of short-term rally. But
nothing materialized. This lack of a retracement rally after a 30 points
drop in the S&amp;amp;P500 between Monday and Tuesday is good for the bears.
Furthermore, seeing that EUR/USD is testing resistance again, I am
establishing an equity short with a financial company. In particular,

in an up trend. However, the intermediate trend is turning negative as
shown in Figure 1. \$45 is an obvious resistance for ABX.TO. Even with
today's positive market moves, ABX.TO fail to catch on the bullish wave
and only touched \$44.86 in the morning optimism (Figure 2). Who knows,
perhaps it might break it sooner than later. But the reward/risk is
