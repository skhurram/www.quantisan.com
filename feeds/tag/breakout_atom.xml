consolidation around the area. See Figure 1 for a daily chart of
EUR/CHF. I just happened to be looking at the charts when this breakdown
occurred last night so I made a few day trades. These scalps turned out
better than I thought because a particular technical analysis phenomenon
worked really well on this move. Referring to Figure 2, a 5-min. chart
of the move, you'll notice that I've marked some Fibonacci levels on
each of the big dive in prices. While there are several Fibonacci levels
that are notable and commonly used, I pay attention to the 50%
retracement level almost exclusively. A half retracement is easy to spot
even with the naked eyes without any technical analysis so even those
that don't use Fibonacci can see it. With this hypothesis in mind, I
shorted EURCHF a few times last night on the bounce to 50% of each of
the move. The first entry was at 1.5048. EURCHF retraced about 50% after
that big dive from 1.5080 to 1.5030. Then it formed a descending
triangle on the 1-minute with the support at 5050. A nice round number
support level. The entry was triggered near the end of the triangle and
right when it broke the support. I held on to this short looking for the
move to take us all the way down below 1.5000 since there's bound to be
lots of stops there (which never happend last night probably because of
SNB intervention). Before that though, we made another quick dive and
then retraced 50% again. I shorted some more with a limit order placed
at the 50% level before hand. So I had two positions sitting from 5048
and 5039. See Figure 2 at the bottom for a chart with the levels marked.
However, by the third dive, it is now obvious that the move down is
getting smaller and smaller. Then when the 50% level of that last move
held for like eternity, and numerous tests of resistance at 5030 failing
yet didn't back down by much every time, I took profit at 5027-5028. The
reward/risk ratio were impressive with these trades. I risked a few pips
to make 10-20 pips. However, one mistake I made which made all these
efforts wasted. Simply put, I did not have enough position size to make
these pips gained worthwhile. Being used to swing trades with much
bigger stops, I merely used my usual lot size for these trades. The
reason being that I didn't expect these to go so well since I've always
been burned by day trading and was just testing the water with these
days. Oh well, these could all have been just because I was lucky last
night. In hindsight, I could have saved myself from all that stress and
made a lot more simply by betting on SNB intervention as many traders
have done. Recall [my lesson on fundamental analysis and the SNB pegging
up the EURCHF market][]? Well, last night presented a great opportunity
to profit from that open secret again when EURCHF tested 1.5000. The
reason why I didn't go long is because it was just too obvious that SNB
would come to the rescue. I thought that they would have waited for
running the stops below 1.5000 before intervening (note to self, don't
second guess). Well, it seems that obviousness works. The optimal entry
for a long EURCHF would have started at the point when I covered for the
same reasons. I should have eased in a long position around 1.5030 with
stop at 1.5000. A reasonable profit target would have been 1.5100. Why
1.5100? Aside from that the fact that it's an obvious resistance, this
is just something I noticed while drawing up the chart for this post. In
Figure 2, I've drawn the 161.8 % Fibonacci extension levels for those 3
down moves discussed. See that they formed the reversal targets
perfectly with equally impressive textbook perfect consolidation
reaction afterwards? If the price action adhered to the Fibonacci
retracements so well as described above, it's no surprise that a Fib.
level would work well for the reversal too. Just because the same people
are probably involved with the move down as well as the move up when all
these happened within mere hours. So two lessons from last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should pay more attention to the 161.8% level in my analysis along
    with the 50% level in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more importantly, don't think the central bank (e.g. SNB) will
    not intervene just because everyone is milking them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

identified &lt;a href="http://www.crackerbarrel.com/"&gt;Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (CBRL) as a
candidate of an in-play stock. CBRL will release their earnings on Sept
15th before the market opens. So there's only Monday before the earnings
and then perhaps a few days after to play this stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price I am watching is \$32.10 based on Figure 1. This is a breakout
setup to the long side. What caught my attention is the recent gap up
breaking a long term trendline resistance with only moderate volume. And
then the lack of a retracement with little volume on the down days
(Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop Entry: \$32.10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop: \$31.40&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target: \$35. Based on the projecting from breaking the wedge formation
of Figure 1. The wedge's height is about \$2.50. So if CBRL breaks out
of \$32. The target is \$34.50. But the round number resistance is so
close at \$35, so it's likely that the push will reach that level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reward / Risk: 2.9 / 0.7 = 4.1 \&amp;lt; 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;CBRL touched \$35 on September 16, just two days after
breaking my stop entry of \$32.10. This was a good trade.&lt;/p&gt;
