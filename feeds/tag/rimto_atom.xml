stock market. Case in point, just look at the media coverage of Research
in Motion (RM.TO) before and after their earnings release yesterday. It
was just days ago when investment firms were going gaga over Research in
Motion (RM.TO). See table below for the accolade of buy recommendations.
Globe and Mail even posted the following article the day before earnings
release, "&lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/expectations-high-as-rim-set-to-report/article1517857/"&gt;Expectations high as RIM set to report&lt;/a&gt;". Then immediately
after RIM's earnings release yesterday, which was after the market close
(when only the big banks and brokers can trade amongst themselves),
headlines such Globe and Mail's "&lt;a href="http://www.google.ca/url?q=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/rim-profit-short-of-expectations/article1519081/&amp;amp;ei=3qa0S7qdBoWdlgeAvuhU&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=news_article&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CDQQqQIoAjAA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEsvQ_j9Nk2sqDxf-40LQLxo_QGNA"&gt;RIM profit short of
expectations&lt;/a&gt;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â½" pops up all over the news wire. Goldman
Sachs even &lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2010/04/01/rim-reactions-goldman-downgrades-to-sell/?mod=yahoo_hs"&gt;promptly downgraded RIM to a SELL&lt;/a&gt;. Citing concerns from
Apple, Google, etc. As if the world around RIM suddenly changed within
minutes before and after their latest earnings! Not surprisingly, RIM
(on Nasdaq) traded -5% post-market last night and gapped down big today.
Anyone that bought into these sales pitch (see table) just days ago
would have been hit hard. This type of &lt;strong&gt;orchestrated raids&lt;/strong&gt; from the
media and big investment firms never cease to disgust me. That is a
reason why I've taken to &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/"&gt;learn to trade&lt;/a&gt; and not invest with a
buy-and-pray mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
