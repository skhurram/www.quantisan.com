yesterday so I had to reassess the position. I sold my shares at \$0.56
for a loss of (\$0.56 - \$0.62) * 1000 = \$70 + \$19.90 commission =
\$89.90 = 0.9% of account. Gold is falling while USD tanked this week.
The lack of volume on today's goldminers rally is also uncharacteristic
of the recent uptrend. The long term uptrend of gold and gold miners is
unmistakable on both fundamental and technical basis. I am taking a
dabble in this junior gold miner as its share price is making a gap fill
on a recent breakout (Fig. 1), amongst other things. Intraday chart
(Fig. 2) is also showing signs of life at this support level. What's
going to happen to gold as it breaks below 1350 (first time since
November) from worries about Chinese inflation, which led to strength in
USD (on fear of further Chinese tightening) as EURUSD dropped 60 pips in
2 hours. See FT: &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ab89d906-244e-11e0-a89a-00144feab49a.html"&gt;Fears grow that China is overheating&lt;/a&gt;. Couple that
with political and economic uncertainty, we have a short term
uncertainty in gold's direction. However, all these is in line with the
underlying gold-bug case that money is becoming more worthless as
governments pump in money to their respective economies. Another point
to note is that as the Shanghai Composite and Bombay Stock Exchange
(i.e. growth markets) are making 3-month lows in recent weeks, people
will start to look for other assets to diversify their wealth. This is
all conjectures anyway. I can't predict the future.I am merely placing
my bet as the stars seem to have aligned for me to increase the
probability of this good reward/risk trade. Mental stop is \$0.55. Hard
stop is \$0.48, however, I'll give it some margin and say 0.40 is my
stop as liquidity is thin in this junior. Thus, risk is (\$0.62 -
\$0.40) * 1000 = \$220 + \$9.95 commission = \$229.95 = 2.4% of
account. Note: You might have noticed that my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/"&gt;trade log&lt;/a&gt; style has
changed for 2011. I am trying to jot down my thought process rather than
the data analysis and numerical logic to better capture my &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;
for the record.&lt;/p&gt;

It got stopped out
2 minutes before the close for a small profit. Following the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-350-hgd-to-10-84-profit-2/"&gt;covering
of my short side play this morning&lt;/a&gt;, I sneaked back in to the gold bug
camp. In particular, I bought some of my recent favourite gold miner,
Ventana Gold Corp. (VEN.TO), a few minutes before the close. Gold held
on to the 1330 support as I've discussed this morning (see &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-350-hgd-to-10-84-profit-2/"&gt;gold chart
in this morning's post&lt;/a&gt;). I
also watched the closing 30 minutes of the market and VEN.TO respected
its 8.90 support level too. See Figure 1. There was a brief touch below
8.90 but it pushed back up quickly (not shown). This is a play inline
with the direction of the recent rally. Just riding the trend. Nothing
fancy. Hard stop is \$8.80. Mental stop is \$8.88. Maximum risk is
(\$8.95 - \$8.80) * 300 = \$45 + \$9.90 commission = \$54.90 = 0.5% of
account. There's a risk of another gap down open tomorrow. So my
position is small in case the market runs away overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

steam despite gold prices hitting record high seemingly on a daily

it fails for the third time. I'll just sit and wait for a while to see
how this one goes. Recent low at \$10.40 is the support to watch.
Coincidentally, the 50 daily MA just crossed over the 200 MA today for a
classic bullish signal (Fig. 2). A contrarian correction (downward) to
bleed off overbought condition is in play, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;

gold price took a dive (Figure 1) before the Bank of England minute
today. However, the support at 10.50 look very promising as VEN.TO made
a couple of successful long tail test of that level in the last 24 hours
(Fig. 2). Seeing that the BoE has blatantly admitted to support the
bandwagon on &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-28/posen-says-bank-of-england-should-buy-more-assets-to-support-economy.html"&gt;more quantitative easing&lt;/a&gt; (along with the FED), the
bullishness in gold is written on the wall. As such, I am re-entering my
VEN.TO position this morning with a smaller amount of shares. New stop
is a close of VEN.TO below 10.50. Volatility is expected to be high. So
I am giving it some intraday leeway to move. A hard stop is set at
10.20. Risk is thus (\$10.67 - \$10.20) * 250 = \$117.50 + \$9.90
commission = \$127.40 = 1.3% of account. For the record, previous
entries were at &lt;a href="../bought-200-ven-to-9-74-stop-8-90/"&gt;9.74&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="../bought-150-ven-to-10-85/"&gt;10.85&lt;/a&gt;. My stop at 10.50 was too tight.
I am admittedly being quite aggressive here. Let's wait and see if it
pays off.&lt;/p&gt;

nothing good out there&lt;/a&gt; today. Yes, I eat my words often. So I took a
long position in Ventana Gold Corp (VEN.TO). That cup-and-handle
breakout from \$9.00 is just textbook (Fig. 1). I am indeed a bit late,
but the trend is now upward. There is a big resistance at \$10. It is
where the June epic decline started. From just above \$10 to \$6.5
between June and July. Now that VEN is back at this level again. I am
betting that the positive momentum would carry it upward. My hard stop
is \$8.90. My mental stop is \$9.50. As VEN seem to like to gap at
\$9.50. From the look of it, \$9.50 level is more important than \$10.
Since we're above it already, this gives me a bit more confidence in
this trade. Another point to note is gold price. It is on a direct train
to test, and possibly, break a new high record (Fig. 2). Risk is (\$9.74
- \$8.90) * 200 = \$168 + \$9.90 commission = \$177.90 = 1.85% of &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/"&gt;RRSP

looks to be the weakest of the silver miners (Figure 3). In particular,
referring to Figure 3, I highlighted the current price moves versus six
months ago. The price movements in the two boxes look similar. Thus I am
looking for a big dive in PAA soon with these puts options. I entered

\$25.00 (the gap) and \$25.15 (38% Fib level in the July dive). As such,
there are a couple of safety cushions in case this doesn't work out. My
mental stop is \$1.30 on the premium. Through time decay (around October
if we trade sideway from now), price appreciation, and mostly a
combination of these two factors. I figured I have about a month's time
to find out if it can break the \$25.15 level. Risk is thus (\$2.27 -
\$1.30) * 100 * 3 = \$291 + \$25.90 commission = \$316.90 = 3.3%. Once
again, that's higher than what I'd recommend. But that's just the worst
case scenario. We should know soon enough if silver can break lower as
it is trading against a descending trendline as shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
