The break of the MACD and Stochastic didn't produce a strong pullback as
I have hoped. However, one thing for certain is that by the time even I
am sure it's going to fall, it would have been too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost entered a short position today. But held back because I am
taking enough risk already with the 4 gold contracts. If I'm to cover 2
fewer Gold shorts, then I may enter a Soybean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the past year of history, it seems that Soybean corrections
precede Gold corrections. Coincidence? They seem to be controlled as a
hedge by HB&amp;amp;B. A big drop in prices should come when these people unload
their holdings back into the equities. i.e. near the bottom of this bear
market.&lt;/p&gt;

However, rather than
enter a short now, I'll probably wait for a retracement. The ATR of
soybean is too much risk for me at the moment, each point move is \$50.
A bad day in soybean would pose a \$3000 paper lost even inside trading
range.&lt;/p&gt;

The
bottom is about 8 minutes after the Dow. Coincidence? I think not. HB&amp;amp;B
are obviously milking the public.&lt;/p&gt;

It
is current trading at a 34-year high. How long can this continue? Both
gold and grains seem to be making record highs. Is this a shorting
opportunity? I'll watch the 3 markets closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note, many famous traders seem to have made their first pot
of gold on soybean futures.&lt;/p&gt;
