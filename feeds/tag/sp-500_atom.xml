&lt;p&gt;The only thing for certain at this point in the market is that there're
a lot of uncertainties. Notice the several big swing days near the
October low but with open and close near each other (a.k.a. the doji's).
Are we at the bottom yet? I don't know. Have we started a rally attempt
this week? Definitely! Is it going to hold? My intuition says likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I say that? Three reasons. Fundamentally, the joint effort by
world central banks to inject billions of dollars into the capital
market isn't going to be unnoticed. Secondly, the up days this week has
been marked by some strong late-day climb across the market. This
suggest the pros/smart money are buying. Thirdly, also notice the
significant volume at the doji last Friday, when the market reached a
new low. Subsequently, the decline in the last two days has been on much
lower, and declining volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the fear and panic are still very much alive.
Profit-taking will create some serious resistance going up. Also, the
market has been very irrational lately, so any fundamental or technical
analysis could very well be thrown out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is, I believe an intermediate term bull phrase is taking
shape, yet be very cautious in your approach and use a conservative risk
management approach. I am not going to &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-errors-lessons-being-long-just-before-the-october-2008-crash/"&gt;repeat my errors from last
month&lt;/a&gt; when I entered full long just before the biggest market crash
of our generation.&lt;/p&gt;

[![S&amp;P 500 review][]][]
:   S&amp;P 500 review

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I have been waiting to go long in this bear market for a few weeks now,
hoping for a bottom soon (first of my errors).  Then on week of
September 29th, I decided to go all in (error #2).  S&amp;amp;P closed at 1099
that Friday.  A week later, on October 10th, the Friday close of S&amp;amp;P 500
was 899 points, and I am still left holding on (error #3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error #4 though, requires some explaination.  Simply put, I was not
reading the chart as I should have.  While both the price action and
contrarian sentiments were bullish, I totally missed out on a basic
technical analysis indicator ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â? the volume.  Looking at
the above chart, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to see that the first
downward break of the trendline in mid-September was confirmed with
volume.  The volume on that day (left blue arrow), and for that entire
week, is substantially higher than usual.  The subsequent mini rally
attempt before the next break has been marked with little volume.  This
suggests that market participants, particularly the longs, still
havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t flocked in yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing that, I [should at least reduce my position size by exiting some
of my most weak positions][] (i.e. least profitable positions) before
the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is not my costliest lesson in trading, it illustrates some
very fundamental lessons which I should &lt;strong&gt;reiterate&lt;/strong&gt;, because I should
have known better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never try to pick the top or bottom.  Which I thought I learned from
    my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/"&gt;futures trading&lt;/a&gt; already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/"&gt;Manage risk according to volatility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exit at any cost if it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look right in a bear
    market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get fixated on the individual stocks, look at
    the bigger picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Actually, I think this all boils down to proper &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/"&gt;risk management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The DJIA is too manipulated. &lt;a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/gm-falls-1950-levels-european/story.aspx?guid={C503DCF6-2571-42CD-AFA4-682958304034}"&gt;GM was downgraded today by S&amp;amp;P&lt;/a&gt;,
conveniently when GM is testing it's long term low. Just where the heck
were these guys a few weeks back? Do they think we're idiots? This is
blatant market manipulation! Anyway, enough with the vent. I was just
going to point out this week's market plunge with respect to the longer
term picture. S&amp;amp;P 500 at 903 today is just shy of its 900 support. Next
support would be 750. The million dollar question is, will we see 750 or
1000 first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With VIX at a multi-year high and the current market turmoil, it seems
to be a good time to write about market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market volatility is a two-edged sword. Day traders dream of catching
the 800 point swing in the YM contracts. Yet, most would lose more being
stopped out before giving up and then missing the swing. For long term
traders, these 800 point swing could cause panic (if you're on the wrong
side) or doubts (should you or should you not take the profit?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my brief experience in &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/day-trading/"&gt;day trading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/"&gt;futures markets&lt;/a&gt;,
I am not one to play with fire. For my longer term plays, I am &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/didnt-cut-losses-as-planned-and-now-paying-dearly/"&gt;feeling
the pain as we speak&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, it is important to realize that although
market &lt;em&gt;volatility is very tempting for quick profits, greed never pays
in trading&lt;/em&gt;. Another characteristic in a highly volatile market is that
there're a lot of emotions going on. As you know, emotions can cloud our
judgement. It's more difficult to trade when you're filled with panic,
fear, greed, excitement, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, market volatility is bad because 1) large swings both
ways at any time and 2) lots of emotions in the market and yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To minimize your risk, it's better to minimize your exposure to the
market at times of high volatility. Thus, I use the rule that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If 50 dma of VIX &gt; 20, then reduce position size to some % (i.e. 50%)
of usual amount.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a corollary, here's another interesting idea. It's widely known that
markets tend to creep up and plunge down, i.e. rising slow and steadily,
and fall quick and hard. Looking at the 50 dma VIX, it's actually a
quicker indicator for the 2007 top than my previous &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/back-to-basics-market-sentiment-via-2-line-ema-on-sp500/"&gt;2-line EMA
indicator for market sentiment&lt;/a&gt;. Conceptually, if we accept that bull
market is slow and bear market is fast, then this idea of using VIX to
signal bull/bear sentiment do seem viable. However, there's already too
many IF's and assumptions for me to take this seriously. Therefore,
let's just stick with using volatility for managing position sizing
only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most, if not THE most, important theme in trading is
identifying if we're in a bull or bear market. It's easier to "ride with
the wave" than to fight against it. While there are an abundance of
work, studies, theories, or whatever, on calling out market sentiments,
I feel that the most useful way of doing it would be ones that stick to
the facts. And the only fact we can be certain of in the market is the
price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's the idea (definitely not original) for &lt;strong&gt;guessing&lt;/strong&gt; market
sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bull market = 50 dma &gt; 200 dma for S&amp;amp;P 500.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bear market = 50 dma \&amp;lt; 200 dma for S&amp;amp;P 500.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any indicator, this is not a law. It's just a signal to give you
a piece of information for you to &lt;strong&gt;intrepret&lt;/strong&gt; based on the
fundamentals and maybe other technical analysis tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
