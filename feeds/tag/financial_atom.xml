(\$14.30 - \$13.97) * 4 * 100 = \$132 + \$27.90 = \$159.90 = 1.6% of
account. Note that calculation is not accounting for option theta (time

It is confirmed
by EUR/USD's rise and treasury's gap down (TLT) today. I'm not going to
argue with the market. So I am ditching my short for Manulife Financial
(MFC.TO) while it is still testing its 13.00 resistance at the open.
12.60 is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level for MFC. It made a textbook
perfect bounce on it (Fig. 1). Also, it's Friday today, so I'd rather
not have the time decay eat more out of my premium by holding over the
weekend. Loss for this trade is (\$1.74 - &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-jan-2010-puts-14-00-1-70-mark-13-25/"&gt;\$1.70&lt;/a&gt;) * 100 * 4 = \$16
- \$27.90 = -\$11.90 = -0.10%. Now that I am out of my short position,
watch the market tank without me on board. Update: MFC and the market
managed an impressive rally today. MFC closed at 13.15. I am glad that I
followed my own strategy. I guess I do make &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/"&gt;good timing once in a blue

This time on Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) with a
January 2011 put at 14 strike price. MFC is trading at \$13.25 at time
of entry. Recent series of &lt;a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-bank-story-no-one-is-talking-about-2010-09-10"&gt;prop desk closings&lt;/a&gt; isn't going to bode
well for the market, particularly for the banks as they need to
recuperate those easy income. On top of it, the lack of push from the
bulls this week as S&amp;amp;P test 1110 resistance doesn't look promising
either. Yet, this could very well be a bear trap. In any case, I am
taking a bearish bet via shorting MFC. Figure 1 shows a chart of MFC. It
is depressed and it is struggling. Moreover, MFC keeps announcing
billions of dollars worth of share offerings lately. I like it. There is
a distinct possibility of a bear raid if MFC can break this \$13.50
resistance level. The gap above \$15 is just staring at me. Hard stop is
at \$1.00 premium. Worst case risk for this trade is thus (\$1.70 -
\$1.00) * 4 * 100 = 280 + \$27.90 commission = \$307.90 = 3.2%.
However, I'd be very cautious if MFC closes above \$13.50. [caption

This is not good for my options as the time delta will slowly eating
away my premium. So I've decided to unload this position at a small loss
just now as the market is testing support across the board. The U.S.
dollar index is testing \$86 resistance. Oil is testing \$78 support.
S&amp;amp;P500 is testing the 1070 support zone. Purchase price for these puts
were &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-48-mark-16-38/"&gt;\$1.48 per contract last Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. When Manulife Financial
(MFC.TO) was trading at 16.38. Loss is (\$1.48 - \$1.43) * 100 * 4 =
\$20 - \$13.95 * 2 commission = \$47.90 = 0.5% of account. As you can
see, the commission is horrible on my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/"&gt;RRSP trading account at
Questrade&lt;/a&gt;. I will wind down trading options from now on and move back
to trading forex in the summer. My live account at &lt;a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/"&gt;Dukascopy&lt;/a&gt; is
ready... Update: The market finally broke support the day after this
exit. This was not a good exit as I lost patience. MFC is testing \$16
support on June 29th opening hour and I don't expect it to hold. This
could turn out to be a winner if I had held.&lt;/p&gt;

1). I'm not sure which way it will go just yet. But I am placing my bet
on the bears as oil (DBO) has already cracked. I waited the whole week
for a retracement to re-enter a short position. I thought the FOMC
announcement today could produce some sort of short-term rally. But
nothing materialized. This lack of a retracement rally after a 30 points
drop in the S&amp;amp;P500 between Monday and Tuesday is good for the bears.
Furthermore, seeing that EUR/USD is testing resistance again, I am
establishing an equity short with a financial company. In particular,
Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) is my victim as it appears to be the weakest
of them all (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

presented a shorting opportunity that I took today. Figure 1 speaks for

vouch for confidence is encouraging for the bears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\$74.00 - \$74.50 is a strong resistance for CM. There are three
scenarios in which this trade can play out. CM can go up, go down, or
move sideway. If CM move upward, I will watch the push above \$74.50. My
current exit stop is at \$75.00 (about \$1 on the premium). However, as
this is an options position. There is a time decay factor working
against me. As such, I will decrease my exit stop by \$1.00 on the share
price every month to compensate. For example, by mid-June, my exit stop
is \$74.00 on the underlying share price of CM. If CM move downward, I
will move my stop to breakeven if it breaks below \$72. If CM move
sideway, I will give it a month's time. If CM just consolidates around
\$74, I will exit by late June for a loss of \$1 (\$300 total) on the
premium. My targets are \$70, \$68, and \$65 as shown on Figure 1. I
will tighten my stop passing each support level. My ideal loss is \$300
at most. That represents 3.4% of my total account on this trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GICS SECTORS REVIEW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the 6-month, 1-month, and 1-week graphic comparison of the
performance of GICS10: energy (XLE), GICS15: materials (XLB), GICS20:
industrials (XLI), GICS25: consumer discretionary (XLY), GICS30:
consumer staples (XLP), GICS35: healthcare (XLV), GICS40: financial
(XLF), GICS45: technology (XLK), GICS:50 telecommunication (IYZ), and
GICS55: utilities (XLU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently, the ball is with the financials for the past few months. 
They have led the turn down (6-month chart) and also the bounce (1-month
chart).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Financial again were leading the pack in the rally. 
However, Energy kept the ball rolling on Thursday while the Financial
were drifting down.  At the other end of the spectrum, Healthcare and
Utilities are against the flow as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of guessing whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to come next week. 
LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s take a closer look at the financial.  As you can
see, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re hanging by a tread right at the support at
the moment.  So &lt;strong&gt;if XLF is to break this support here,
itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to take the whole market with it&lt;/strong&gt;.  Then,
weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be breaking the 750 support for the S&amp;amp;P 500 and
go back to the 600ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s range as IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve
been saying for the past 2 weeks.  This is definitely one scenario which
I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like it to happen.  As always,
letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s see how the market acts next week and go with the
flow.  Again, watch the 750 and 800 zones.&lt;/p&gt;
