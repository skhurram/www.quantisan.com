portfolio. This position is definitely one of the higher risk because of
the leverage in options. I shorted these puts at \$1.20 two weeks ago.
This represent a profit of \$120 - \$15 for commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABB tested the 40 day MA on pretty low volume. It is hanging around the
\$13 mark today. However, the market looks weak as we're testing the 850
resistance again on the S&amp;amp;P500 as we speak. So I'm unloading this first
because if it breaks down, ABB could dive fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upside: Inverse head and shoulder forming. Positive divergence on
indicators at this neck level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance: \$14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downside: Diminishing volume for past couple of months. 200 day MA still
down and 10 day MA just turned downward too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support: \$12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: So many stocks and indices seem to be tittering at their
supports today. I even considered entering into FAS or UWM for a bounce
move. But I decided to be safe and placed my bet on strength and clearer
signs. Since I entered when ABB is trading at \$12.17 and my stop is
\$11.90 or so, I consider this to be a low risk trade for a potential
Obama rally next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target: \$15&lt;/p&gt;

We gapped up at the open, stayed in a
trading range for the day, then slowly rose up in the last hour, but
only to lose a small chunk and settled at 850, again. The volume has
been low throughout the day and the internals didn't look too good.
That's what prompted me to unload about half my positions in the last 45
minutes. The recent beating in my account certainly is making me being
very cautious now. I'd rather &lt;strong&gt;save my ammo to enter higher later when
we get confirmation for a rally than wait for one with bloated bullish
positions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the S&amp;amp;P 500, TICK, and Advance-Decline line. Aside from the
open gap up peak, both the TICK and A-D line failed to impress
throughout the day. Actually, it was lack of strength in the numerous
840 tests and the weak 850 breakout about 3:20 that worried me. Notice
the lower lows in both the TICK and A-D line at the 840 and 850
breakouts in the chart below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first to go was -90 DELL @ 9.90 at 3:25pm for about a 50% loss. I
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-90-dell-1649/"&gt;bought DELL at the beginning of October for \$16.49&lt;/a&gt; and it has been
underperforming throughout the two months. There's been little volume
since I bought, up or down. Even with the exuberant buying on the market
today, DELL failed to break above \$10 (it did close at \$10.14). Most
important reason for me selling this long term holding now is that
there's very little volume even on this up day when everyone's expecting
a real bear rally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, I sold my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/"&gt;C calls from the strangle placed Friday&lt;/a&gt;. As I
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-uyg-449/"&gt;said earlier in the day&lt;/a&gt;, the news that the FED is bailing out
Citigroup has rocketed its share price from \$3.17 at my time of
purchase to \$6.50 on the morning rush. However, C share price eased
down throughout the day and failed to break \$6 with high volume. I sold
at about \$6.05. I purchased the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/"&gt;+2 Dec 5 calls for \$0.79&lt;/a&gt; and sold them for \$1.77. This was a
speculative play and I didn't want to be greedy. So I sold when C share
price showed it's lacking steam to continue to move up ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_888" align="aligncenter" width="500"

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I sold my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-abb-100-dec-08-10-call-155/"&gt;+2 ABB Dec 10 calls purchased at \$1.55&lt;/a&gt; for
\$1.70. A breakeven trade after commission. The drawdown was humongous
in this trade since I have &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/"&gt;missed some previous stops&lt;/a&gt;. The ABB share
price action is a lot like DELL today, a lot of fireworks but no real
substance. Yes, the price is up a lot today, but there's no volume from
it. In particular, in the last 15 minute, ABB dived back down to its
major pivot point of \$11.10. I quickly unloaded my calls then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else, I am really hoping for a good bear rally. It would
do everyone, both bears and bulls, some good at this point. The thinking
is, after so many fake rallies lately, this one has to be it, right?
However, having learned my lesson in bottom picking in this bear market,
I'm putting my hope/logic aside and interpret what I see in front of me.
From today's price and volume movement, this rally doesn't seem like it
will follow through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hope I'm wrong though, if we can hold the 845/840 level on the
S&amp;amp;P500 tomorrow. Then I would be looking to add to my already 60% long
holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

Every time I think we're at a bottom, the market rally a bit to get my
hopes up and then continue to drift down more. In retrospect, there are
so many trading no-no's I have broken with that dangerous mentality. My
account is down significantly as of this writing and I have learned many
old and new lessons throughout these weeks. In fact, I have demonstrated
improving trading &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/"&gt;technique&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1190/"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt; even as I was losing
money overall (what an oxymoron). Rather I'm trying to comfort myself or
not, the fact is that losing money is simply unacceptable in trading. So
I will review these trades in this post and perhaps learn something from
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title suggest, this is a post for post-hoc analysis of the
options which I held into expiry (3 losing and 1 winning). I'll do this
chronologically. The longest Nov09 position I have is SLW Nov 2.5 Call.
I have been a big fan of SLW as I've &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/"&gt;written and traded SLW numerous
times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, I've annoted my charts
more than usual and will show more and write less in this post. I noted
my entry point in each trade, and labelled the stop and post-hoc &lt;strong&gt;ideal
exit/stop points&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_857" align="aligncenter" width="500"

&lt;p&gt;My effective &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/"&gt;entry point in my SLW Nov 2.5 Calls&lt;/a&gt; were at SLW share
price of \$2.90 (SLW closed at \$2.81 Friday). I bought 2 Calls for
\$0.55 and at expiry, they are worth \$0.325. A loss of \$45 + \$15 for
commission as of this writing. I held on to my 2.5 calls and exercised
them, so +200 shares of SLW for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is ABB on the same day. The share price for ABB was at \$10.31
when I entered. ABB closed Friday at \$9.95. I bougt the three ABB Nov
10 Calls for \$0.90. They are worth \$0.05 each. A total loss of \$255 +
\$15 for commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_858" align="aligncenter" width="500"

&lt;p&gt;Then we have TCK entered at TCK share price of \$5.575. I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-tck-100-nov-08-5-call-100/"&gt;bought two
TCK Nov 5 Calls for \$1.00&lt;/a&gt; each and they are now worthless. A
complete wipeout of \$200 + \$15 commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there's this puny winning day trade in the last 40 minute of
Friday. I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/"&gt;bought a UYG Nov 3 Call for \$0.55&lt;/a&gt; and it expired for
\$0.95. A profit of \$40 - \$15 comission, so a total of +\$25 so far. I
held on to this call and exercised it. I have +100 shares of UYG to
carry over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_868" align="aligncenter" width="500"

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, &lt;strong&gt;if only I have used trailing stops, I could have held
onto some of the profits and not turn winning trades into a losing
ones&lt;/strong&gt;. I didn't want to let the large swing in premiums stop me out
from a big rally. That's why I didn't use trailing stop. However, the
lack of subsequent follow-through and confirmation in the rally should
have been a glaring alarm sign. I should have put in trailing stops from
this lack of strength in the rally. &lt;strong&gt;Any counter-trend position should
be carefully managed with tighter than usual risk management&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have let my &lt;em&gt;undying hope for a rally&lt;/em&gt; clouded my judgement. This
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/move-from-certainty-to-curiosity-to-improve-your-trading/"&gt;stubborn need to be right&lt;/a&gt; is a very fundamental psychological flaw
in trading. If I can't stop doing that in the future, I might as well
quit trading manually and focus on developing my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/"&gt;quantitative financial
engineering&lt;/a&gt; work. However, as I have noted, I think I'm improving
lately and upon further reflection, I believe I have come up with a
potential methodology to correct myself in the act ... More on this as I
develop on this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered my last short put. Bought ABB Nov 12.5 put for \$1.95 (bid:
\$1.8, ask \$2.05 at the time). I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-170/"&gt;shorted this ABB put at \$1.70&lt;/a&gt;. As
I've opined yesterday, things don't look good on the market. Despite &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/"&gt;my
earlier optimism for a bear rally&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/monday-after-the-last-minute-market-dive-outlook-for-the-rest-of-the-day/"&gt;market obviously haven't
followed through&lt;/a&gt;. The reality is that there's a good possibility of
another market crash at this critical support level. Thus, I have exited
today on signs of weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the broad market, the S&amp;amp;P failed to push through the morning when I
made this trade. Figure 2 shows a double top at 865 with corresponding
double top in the TICK (neutral read) and lower Advance-Decline line
(bearish read).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point is that ABB today merely filled the down gap, and this
second retest of 865 on S&amp;amp;P only led to a lower low with lower volume.
In terms of intraday move, this is very bearish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than sit tight and hope for the best, I unloaded this last
short put as planned to reduce my downside risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have plenty of long calls in ABB and others if we do rally from
here. I am still very bullish on ABB from its fundamental and signs of
big block accumulations recently. Just that with only 3 more days until
options expiration, I can't risk having the shares put to me now that
I'm low on cash from all the greedy calls buying in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;

immediately for my trades, but I needed to keep my eyes on the market
due to the fact that I went all in today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really tired after a long day and the fact that I went swimming
right after the close. So I'll cut myself some slack and refer you to my
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-recollection-of-my-analysis-for-buying-when-sp-broke-down-to-820-today/"&gt;market analysis post from today&lt;/a&gt; instead. Long story short, I entered
long because of the low volume retest of major support. I held because
the price and volume showed strength in testing the resistance
throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am heavy on ABB because S&amp;amp;P broke down to 820 and ABB is still above
the Oct low of \$10. It has held on triumphantly in this leg of market
selloff. Refer to my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-170/"&gt;ABB entry yesterday for a more detailed analysis
of the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added to SLW because the commodities are showing some strength too. I
have been a fan of SLW for a while, take a &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/"&gt;look at those posts for my
opinions of SLW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan now will be as usual, I will unload into strength starting with
my weakess position and work my way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There're a lot I want to write down, but my mind is blank now. So I'll
leave this as is.&lt;/p&gt;

at \$10.44. I am adding to my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-170/"&gt;ABB short puts from this morning&lt;/a&gt; and
bought some Dec 10 calls for \$1.55. This is a steal! My &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-170/"&gt;analysis from
the previous entry&lt;/a&gt; still stands. &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/using-option-pain-max-pain-to-estimate-stock-price/"&gt;Max
pain&lt;/a&gt; for Dec of ABB is at \$20... At effective price of \$11.55 for
my shares, the risk/reward potential is ... &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrote an In The Money Nov 12.5 put for \$1.70. ABB share price was at
\$10.92 at time of entry. I have been trading in and out too many times
this past two weeks. This trade is intended to let it expire or let the
option being put to me. I have the cash ready to buy 100 ABB shares if
it doesn't expire for an effective price of \$10.80 / share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three reasons why I'm fundamentally bullish on ABB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;\$8.6 billion in cash and \$2 billion in debt (0.2 debt/equity
    ratio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is making use of this cash and current market panic to expand its
    operation. See: Cash-Rich ABB Speeds Up Buys As Markets Weaken. It's
    one of the few companies not afraid to act at this time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABB makes power control and distribution systems. It's one of the
    largest builder of power grids. All these talk of alternative
    energy, reduce oil use, hybrid/all-electric cars, etc. have one
    thing in common -- electricity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upside: Good fundamental, active management to make use of current
condition. Significant volume around \$10 last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Resistance: Recent top of \$14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downside: We seem to be in correction of 10/28 day, moving to low of
about \$10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support: \$10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Risk/reward ratio of about 3 to 1. Not that great. But I
can afford to have the shares put to me if this doesn't expire next
week. Not saying I would sit still if it does collapse, but at least I'm
not biting more than I can handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note, I entered because the market seem to be stronger today.
Notice the Advance Decline line staying around neutral and the TICK not
really down that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: An hour later and we've broken down. ABB is at \$10.39 and S&amp;amp;P
at 868. I guess I should have waited til the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
