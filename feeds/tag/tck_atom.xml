(TCK-B.TO) at \$36.03 but got &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-110-tck-b-to-36-03-stopped-out-at-breakeven/"&gt;stopped out at breakeven&lt;/a&gt;. In
hindsight, the retracement after testing the \$37 resistance held the
50% level near the close. That was a bullish sign that I missed at the
time and only realized during my weekend review. As you know, the TSX
market gapped about 2% up and S&amp;amp;P gapped about 4% up right at the open.
The market traded in a range all day but managed to hold the gap.
However, EUR/USD closed its gap and is testing 1.27 support as I write
this. The EUR/USD pair will be an important pair to watch as the
European Union drama unfolds. With regard to TCK, Figure 1 speaks for
itself. It gapped up about 8% and closed up 8.78% at \$39.53. I decided
not to chase the market early on today as the reward/risk ratio just
isn't as appealing anymore. There are always opportunities sailing
around the corner. So there is no need to go out of breath chasing that
one missed boat.&lt;/p&gt;

TCK.B gapped up almost
7% at the Monday open to \$38.88. I won't be chasing the market at this
point as the reward/risk ratio isn't appealing anymore. Update: I got
stopped out at breakeven (after commission) before I can post this piece
at the end of the day. I'm back to all cash going into the weekend. I am
taking a dip in Teck Resources (TCK/B.TO) with 110 shares bought at
\$36.03. This is a trade to "buy when everyone else is in fear".
Following my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-hell-and-back-a-review-of-tsx-after-a-v-day/"&gt;assessment of the market yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I don't think
things are that bad, yet. So I am establishing a small position in a
strong company today. TCK is trading on its 200 day moving average at
\$35 this week (Figure 1). Yesterday's epic dive and recovery didn't
break this \$35 support. So that's a very good sign for TCK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Tech Resources
(TCK-B.TO)"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO.png" /&gt;][][/caption] Furthermore, \$35 is an obvious
psychological round number support. It is also above the recent low of
\$32.50 printed in February of this year as shown in Figure 1. The
oscillator value (top of Figure 1) is making a positive divergence as
TCK is testing this support level). I entered today based on the 5-day
intraday chart. This morning's opening hour test of \$35 support has
lower volume than earlier this week (Figure 2). As such, I think \$35
can hold. So I entered when the price shot above minor resistance at
\$36.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TCK-B.TO

drifted back under \$35.50 after I entered but then reversed and tested
\$37. I moved my stop loss to breakeven as it touched an equidistance
price opposite of my stop. Just so I don't see profits turn into losses.
If I get stopped out today, I will not re-enter until after the weekend.
My target is \$40 and original stop was \$35 for about a 4 to 1 reward
to risk ratio. I am risking 1.25% in this trade with a position size of
110 shares.&lt;/p&gt;

TCK made
it above \$5.00 in the morning with mediocre volume. Then I watched it
break above \$5 again around noon and it was disappointingly
unspectacular. This isn't a good sign. On top of this, S&amp;amp;P 500 seems to
be on the verge of breaking below the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/pre-market-analysis-march-20-2009/"&gt;support of 780 as I've noted in
the morning pre-market analysis&lt;/a&gt;. So I decided to place a stop to
close my long-held position at \$4.87, just below yesterday's intra-day
trough at \$4.88. TCK was marked at \$4.98 or so at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then at 13:19, my stop was triggered. Two hours later, TCK is now
trading at \$4.65. The S&amp;amp;P is holding out at 770, which isn't all that
bad. Perhaps this is just a shakeout before another leg of this bull
run. Perhaps 800 was indeed the end of this leg of the rally. I'm not
sure at the moment. What matters is that [from my analysis, there is a
higher risk than reward expectancy at the moment][]. So I'm just saving
my chips rather than risk them over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's interesting to see that my prediction as pretty accurate this
morning. We are in fact trading in the 845 - 870 level on the S&amp;amp;P. After
having so many large swing days in the market, this is good that we're
taking a breather. And then get ready for some more big moves probably
after the US Thanksgiving holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One stock that's been lackluster lately is TCK. It is clearly not a
stock in-play at the moment. This is a huge contrast to the times
earlier when lots of &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-tck-100-nov-08-5-call-100/"&gt;bad news were hitting TCK&lt;/a&gt; and the share price
tanked. While being out of sight likely, the price continued to drift
down to some new lows. Unlike many of the players in the market, there
just isn't much swing in TCK even though we've been moving like 50
points on the S&amp;amp;P on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upside: This record low price level and the lack of interest in the
stock. It has to move one way or the other some time. Even though I have
a bullish bias in TCK, I am using an options strangle to hedge my
position. Just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downside: We might be stuck inbetween my breakeven price of 1.97 and
5.53 until December. The exact premium paid was 0.27 for the 2.5 Put and
0.26 for the 5 Call.&lt;/p&gt;

Every time I think we're at a bottom, the market rally a bit to get my
hopes up and then continue to drift down more. In retrospect, there are
so many trading no-no's I have broken with that dangerous mentality. My
account is down significantly as of this writing and I have learned many
old and new lessons throughout these weeks. In fact, I have demonstrated
improving trading &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/"&gt;technique&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1190/"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt; even as I was losing
money overall (what an oxymoron). Rather I'm trying to comfort myself or
not, the fact is that losing money is simply unacceptable in trading. So
I will review these trades in this post and perhaps learn something from
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title suggest, this is a post for post-hoc analysis of the
options which I held into expiry (3 losing and 1 winning). I'll do this
chronologically. The longest Nov09 position I have is SLW Nov 2.5 Call.
I have been a big fan of SLW as I've &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/"&gt;written and traded SLW numerous
times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, I've annoted my charts
more than usual and will show more and write less in this post. I noted
my entry point in each trade, and labelled the stop and post-hoc &lt;strong&gt;ideal
exit/stop points&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_857" align="aligncenter" width="500"

&lt;p&gt;My effective &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/"&gt;entry point in my SLW Nov 2.5 Calls&lt;/a&gt; were at SLW share
price of \$2.90 (SLW closed at \$2.81 Friday). I bought 2 Calls for
\$0.55 and at expiry, they are worth \$0.325. A loss of \$45 + \$15 for
commission as of this writing. I held on to my 2.5 calls and exercised
them, so +200 shares of SLW for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is ABB on the same day. The share price for ABB was at \$10.31
when I entered. ABB closed Friday at \$9.95. I bougt the three ABB Nov
10 Calls for \$0.90. They are worth \$0.05 each. A total loss of \$255 +
\$15 for commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_858" align="aligncenter" width="500"

&lt;p&gt;Then we have TCK entered at TCK share price of \$5.575. I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-tck-100-nov-08-5-call-100/"&gt;bought two
TCK Nov 5 Calls for \$1.00&lt;/a&gt; each and they are now worthless. A
complete wipeout of \$200 + \$15 commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there's this puny winning day trade in the last 40 minute of
Friday. I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/"&gt;bought a UYG Nov 3 Call for \$0.55&lt;/a&gt; and it expired for
\$0.95. A profit of \$40 - \$15 comission, so a total of +\$25 so far. I
held on to this call and exercised it. I have +100 shares of UYG to
carry over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_868" align="aligncenter" width="500"

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, &lt;strong&gt;if only I have used trailing stops, I could have held
onto some of the profits and not turn winning trades into a losing
ones&lt;/strong&gt;. I didn't want to let the large swing in premiums stop me out
from a big rally. That's why I didn't use trailing stop. However, the
lack of subsequent follow-through and confirmation in the rally should
have been a glaring alarm sign. I should have put in trailing stops from
this lack of strength in the rally. &lt;strong&gt;Any counter-trend position should
be carefully managed with tighter than usual risk management&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have let my &lt;em&gt;undying hope for a rally&lt;/em&gt; clouded my judgement. This
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/move-from-certainty-to-curiosity-to-improve-your-trading/"&gt;stubborn need to be right&lt;/a&gt; is a very fundamental psychological flaw
in trading. If I can't stop doing that in the future, I might as well
quit trading manually and focus on developing my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/"&gt;quantitative financial
engineering&lt;/a&gt; work. However, as I have noted, I think I'm improving
lately and upon further reflection, I believe I have come up with a
potential methodology to correct myself in the act ... More on this as I
develop on this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a plethora of horrible news for TCK lately. Last week on 11/11,
&lt;a href="http://www.financialpost.com/trading_desk/mining/story.html?id=950874"&gt;Financial Post published an article&lt;/a&gt; about it. TCK gapped down on
11/12. Even the Motley Fool has an article titled "What the Heck, Teck?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCK share price seem to be settling in \$5 - \$6. So why the heck am I
long now? Ignoring the hypes, the fundamentals of TCK still stand. See
the Motley Fool article. It has \$2.7 cash/share and 0.17 debt/equity
ratio. Granted, it took on \$9.8 billion of debt recently, about &lt;em&gt;4
times its current market cap.&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technicals though, are looking good. On the daily chart, the VW-MACD
is showing a positive divergence. The CO has reached an unprecedented
low and is just heading back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the commodities are showing signs of a positive divergence
too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upside: In addition to the above, Max Pain is at \$30 (\$10 for CBOE
data) for November! Yes, \$30!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance: \$6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downside: Same reasons why TCK has dropped from \$30 to \$5. Possibility
of defaulting on massive loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support: \$5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Max pain at \$30 when we're just below \$6! TCK is a
diversified miner, a value &lt;em&gt;producing&lt;/em&gt; company. TCK and &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/abb/"&gt;ABB&lt;/a&gt; are now
my top choices in this struggling economy.&lt;/p&gt;
