data-driven. From encouraging management to make strategic decisions
with hard data to building real-time feedback loop within our products
themselves. We have built the infrastructure in place to capture and
analyse streams of high granularity data using open source tools like
Kafka, Hadoop, and Cascalog. Now the hard part is to convince the rest
of the company that counted numbers on an Excel spreadsheet is
insufficient so that they can incorporate these new high-frequency and
high-granularity information in their everyday decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came to light for me when I tried to revamp our Attribution
Modelling, which is a fancy marketing term for how referral is
attributed and doesn't have to do with mathematical modelling at all.
Many companies traditionally use a last-referral-takes-the-cake
approach. Say if a customer comes in via an email referral first, leaves
the site, then comes back in from an Adword to ultimately make a
purchase, the Adword would get attributed for that revenue produced.
This last-referral method is a lazy way of doing things. Lead generating
referrals get no credit and return on investment values are biased
towards closing-stage marketing efforts. Granted, doing anything else
would require a global view of customer journey, which is a non-trivial
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that is exactly what we're able to do easily now. So we
took a couple of days to spike out a fair-share attribution model such
that every touch point a customer used get a share of the pie. The
intention is to provide a holistic view of referrers efficacy to feed
into our higher-level models. But seeing that the old system is so
unrealistic, I thought I might as well open it for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening a can of worms, that was what it felt like. I found that things
like financial reports and people's bonuses are tied to this old
attribution modelling system. Even though it is obvious to everyone that
the old attribution modelling system is unrealistic, changing it would
require changing the work processes of multiple individuals across the
company. You know what they say about people's habits? Habits are hard
to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing that this is a fundamental obstacle to our company's
competitiveness, I've taken a break from pushing our data architecture
to build and evangelise internal data products. I've been working
closely individually with our business people to identify ways of using
data, staging data views from Hadoop/Cascalog back into good old MySQL,
and assisting them to generate actionable data with SQL to make their
lives easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of such views borrows a technique from my algorithmic
trading. By applying a breakout strategy (which I wrote entirely in SQL,
good fun) on the revenue and cost time-series data of our PPC and SEO
campaigns, our PPC/SEO manager now have available a customisable
screener for abnormality with any of our thousands of continuous
marketing campaigns. Very much like a stock screener for breakouts. This
used to be a subjective process based on a spreadsheet of numbers and
expert opinions. Now it's data-driven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a saying that a business
is its people. To become a data-driven organisation, you need
data-driven people. I never realised the significance of this until now.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="data-driven organisation"></category></entry><entry><title>My talk on bootstrapping data science in a company</title><link href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-talk-on-bootstrapping-data-science-in-a-company/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-25T10:15:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Paul Lam</name></author><id>tag:www.quantisan.com,2012-03-25:my-talk-on-bootstrapping-data-science-in-a-company/</id><summary type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/embed?id=19wVHXeMM_uOfGqDJszZdn4TyXvlKRRoxpf65HyiaK5A&amp;amp;start=false&amp;amp;loop=false&amp;amp;delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="480" height="389" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</summary><category term="presentation"></category><category term="data-driven organisation"></category></entry></feed>
