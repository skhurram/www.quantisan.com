I have violated my
own rule and didn't dump it when the total premium dipped below my stop
at \$0.50. The 12 Put/13 Call premium is now worth \$0.15/\$0.095 =
\$0.20. This is a loss of \$132 + \$30 comission if I were to close the
position now. Frankly, I haven't been watching over this position this
week as much as I used to because of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one logical reason for me to be still holding on to this.
As you can see from Figure 1, the daily chart to the right illustrates a
coiling price action over the past couple of weeks. The overall market
looks similar to this chart of XLF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the writing is on the wall now for a breakout, the million dollar
question though, is when? This lack of action could very well drag on
for days more. With option expiration just next week, this position is
looking like it will expire worthless (more slap on the hand for not
ditching when it hit stop).&lt;/p&gt;
