(a.k.a. financial advisor) at a bank isn't appealing to you, then it is
time to consider your investment choices. I am about to contribute for
the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/considering-investment-options-for-my-first-rrsp/"&gt;first time ever into my RRSP&lt;/a&gt; this year. So I performed my due
diligence by researching and evaluating my choices. This post is a
ranking of my findings. I evaluate each investment strategy according to
three criterias, in descending order of importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk&lt;/strong&gt;. Will I lose sleep at night if I put all my money in it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward&lt;/strong&gt;. How much can I potentially gain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effort&lt;/strong&gt;. How much time and energy do I need to spend on it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My overall portfolio is exposed to enough risk already from my other
trading activities. So my risk appetite is leaning towards a
conservative approach. Also note that I factor in costs as a part of my
risk assessment. I place a 40% emphasis on this criteria. Next, I
consider the return of each investment vehicle using a 40% weight. For
obvious reasons. Lastly, I prefer something that requires as little time
and effort as possible. I weight this criteria at 20%. As I've said
numerous times, I don't like the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/"&gt;limitations in a registered
account&lt;/a&gt;. It is like trying to invest with one hand tied behind my
back. I do not want to put much effort to manage this account because I
can do better in my regular trading. The resulting ranking of the six
types of markets &lt;em&gt;that I am considering&lt;/em&gt; for my RRSP (and TFSA) is as
follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guaranteed savings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indices or sectors (through passive mutual funds or ETF's)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed income (using a mutual fund or ETF bond index)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively managed mutual funds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing of note about investing in physical gold within a registered
account is that it can only be done at &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/"&gt;Questrade&lt;/a&gt; as far as I know.
Although I doubt they are the only one. Here is the table I used to
estimate this ranking. I give each category a score from 1 (bad) to 5
(good) based on my own experience and my sentiment of future market
condition. So yes, it is a very crude guess at best. Nevertheless, the
table shows that my best choice is to either put my RRSP money in a
savings account or invest in indices using passive mutual funds (like
the TD e-Series) or ETF's. However, I plan to do both. I will trade
indices in my RRSP and put my TFSA money in a high yield savings
account. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="493" caption="RRSP

longest time. Unfortunately though, that is because of my long stay in
academia plus a couple of years of a low salary research position. I
didn't have to pay much income taxes, if at all. Things are different
now that I am working in a full time job with a decent pay. I am
reminded of the impact of our high Canadian taxes from the missing chunk
on every paycheck. That is why I am looking into what to do with my RRSP
contribution lately. Last month, I analyzed the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/"&gt;cost-benefit of a Tax
Free &lt;em&gt;Trading&lt;/em&gt; Account&lt;/a&gt;. I concluded that &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-4/"&gt;a TFSA trading account is
not worth my while&lt;/a&gt; for the moment. So I will probably just stash my
TFSA contribution in a good old savings account for now. That is not the
case with a RRSP. One big difference that change the whole argument
around with RRSP is that any contribution that I make into it is tax
deductible! I won't go into details here because I hate taxes. Refer to
the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_Retirement_Savings_Plan"&gt;Wikipedia entry on RRSP&lt;/a&gt; if you are unfamiliar with it.
Essentially, I am guaranteed about 30% (or your marginal tax rate) of
"profit" by way of tax refund for the amount of money which I put into
my RRSP account. I don't know about you, but 30% is a massive return for
me! And it's risk free! (Technically it's just a refund of my own money,
but still) The benefit of having a RRSP is obvious. What I have been
pondering about is where should I put my money in my RRSP? As I
discussed in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/"&gt;Benefits of trading in a TFSA account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, there are many
limitations to a self-directed registered account. Although there are
certainly other options than just trading stocks in a registered
account. Here are the options that I have considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Savings account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutual funds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchange traded funds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my next post, I will &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/ranking-investment-options-for-my-self-directed-rrsp/"&gt;rank my preferences for each retirement investment option&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

gain tax in Canada. But just to be sure before filing my taxes soon,
I've decided to double check the facts from Canada Revenue Agency. As
you know, the difference between income tax and capital gain tax is
substantial. Income tax is taxed at your marginal tax rate. Whereas
capital gain tax is a generous half of your marginal tax rate. That
works out to a 10% to 20% difference. Taxes in Canada is generally
simple to do. The problem though, is sifting through the cacophony of
information within the Canada Revenue Agency to find out the applicable
rules. I've copy and pasted a couple of relevant excerpts from the 2010
CRA &lt;a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/menu/ITSC-e.html"&gt;Income Tax Interpretation Bulletin&lt;/a&gt; for the record. Basically,
forex trading can be treated as either income or capital gain tax in
Canada (surprise). According to &lt;a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it95r/it95r-e.html"&gt;IT-95R Foreign exchange gains and
losses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where it can be determined that a gain or loss on foreign exchange
arose as a direct consequence of the purchase or sale of goods abroad,
or the rendering of services abroad, and such goods or services are
used in the &lt;strong&gt;business operations&lt;/strong&gt; of the taxpayer, such gain or loss
is brought into income account. If, on the other hand, it can be
determined that a gain or loss on foreign exchange arose as a direct
consequence of the&lt;strong&gt;purchase or sale of capital assets&lt;/strong&gt;, this gain or
loss is either a capital gain or capital loss, as the case may be.
Generally, the nature of a foreign exchange gain or loss is &lt;strong&gt;not
affected by the length of time&lt;/strong&gt; between the date the property is
acquired (or disposed of) and the date upon which payment (or receipt)
is effected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it is very vague. That's why forex trading can be
considered income or capital gain tax. It is up to you and your
accountant to figure out which works for you. A noteworthy point in the
above excerpt is that the holding period is not taken into account.
&lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;So there's no 30-day rule
like in the states whereby frequent trading would miss out the capital
loss credit if they re-purchase the same asset within 30-day of
disposal.&lt;/span&gt; Update: Looks like I have misconstrued the above
article with regard to capital loss. As Olga pointed out in the
comments, Chapter 5 of T4037 defines &lt;em&gt;Superficial Loss&lt;/em&gt;. In which if you
&lt;em&gt;repurchase&lt;/em&gt; your property (e.g. stock) within 30-days after a sale at a
loss, then that initial loss cannot be deducted as a capital loss. More
about the &lt;a href="http://www.wheredoesallmymoneygo.com/superficial-loss-rules-in-canada/"&gt;Superficial Loss rules in Canada&lt;/a&gt; can be found at
WhereDoesAllMyMoneyGo.com. Further down the page in IT-95R, we have the
following bullet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A taxpayer who has transactions in foreign currency or foreign
currency futures that do not form part of business operations, or are
merely the result of sundry dispositions of foreign currency by an
individual, will be accorded by the Department the &lt;strong&gt;same treatment as
that of a "speculator" in commodity futures&lt;/strong&gt; see 7 and 8 or IT-346R.
However, if such a taxpayer has special "Inside" information
concerning foreign exchange, he will be required to report his gains
and losses on income account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it346r/it346r-e.html"&gt;IT-346R Commodity Futures and Certain Commodities&lt;/a&gt; explains the tax
treatment of speculation in the commodity markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a general rule, it is acceptable for speculators to report all
their gains and losses from transactions in commodity futures or in
commodities as&lt;strong&gt;capital gains and losses&lt;/strong&gt; with the result that only
one-half the gain is taxable, and one-half the loss is allowable
subject to certain restrictions, (hereinafter called "capital
treatment") provided such reporting is followed consistently from year
to year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there, we have it. Amateur forex traders, such as myself, can report
our forex trading gain/loss as capital gains and losses. The reason
being that &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex"&gt;forex trading&lt;/a&gt; isn't part of my business operation because
I have another primary source of income (e.g. salary from another job).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Canada"></category><category term="tax"></category></entry><entry><title>Is a $5000 Questrade TFSA trading account cost effective?

Let's finish this cost-benefit
analysis before the weekend. Here are back links for &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-2/"&gt;Part

expected return as derived through part 2 and part 3 of this series. As
you can see, I'm only expected to break-even by risking 1% of my \$5000
TFSA trading account. Trading just for the sake of break-even isn't
exactly an enviable goal. Based on my statistics, I typically say an
expected return of 0.10% per trade is acceptable. Looking at the table,
that would require that I risk 1.5% per trade. [caption id=""
align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TFSA Trading Cost-Benefit for
Reward/Risk = 2.0 and 40% win rate"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/TFSA_trading_cost-benefit_analysis.png" /&gt;][][/caption] So I'll have to
risk 1.5% just to scrape in 0.10% of profit? The problem is obvious.
Using a \$5000 trading account with \$5 commission, along with my
historical trading performance simply do not justify the odds. I started
this series to study the cost effectiveness of a Questrade TFSA trading
account. But the conclusion which I derived is much broader. Considering
that even without being taxed, a \$5000 TFSA trading account is
insufficient for trading with a commission of \$5 or higher. Thus, if
this is a taxed, non-registered trading account, the cost would be even
more. As such, not only is \$5000 an insufficient capital for a
Questrade TFSA trading account; \$5000 is simply too little money to
trade any trading account with \$5 of commission per trade for me.
Remember though, this cost-benefit analysis is based on my own
statistics. You can input your own parameters into &lt;a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AnZW_RfDqK11dG5jVzUwbDIxWEQ5aFV3cjVRdU5BbFE&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;this spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;
to get &lt;strong&gt;your own set of results&lt;/strong&gt;. To be fair, I must clarify that the
problem isn't with Questrade. Even with their &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/"&gt;lowest trading commission
in Canada&lt;/a&gt; (affiliate link), a \$5 trading commission for an account
of \$5000 is simply too much for me. Yes, there's nothing to stop you
from trading with a \$5 commission for a \$5000 account. Heck, many have
claimed to be successful with less than \$5000. However, that's just not
my style. I don't gamble with my hard earned money. I only trade when
the odds are in my favour. If the cost is un-proportionately high, it's
as if I've suffered a setback even before I begin fighting the battle.
As such, I'm going to say "no thanks!" to a Questrade TFSA trading
account for now. My short term plan is to look for a guaranteed TFSA
savings account until I can develop a trading system for Canadian stocks
that would justify the cost-benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="cost analysis"></category><category term="Questrade"></category><category term="tax"></category><category term="TFSA"></category></entry><entry><title>Is a $5000 Questrade TFSA trading account cost effective?

trading cost analysis series. Part 1 is an &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/"&gt;introduction outlining the
rationale&lt;/a&gt; for this work. Let's pick up where we left off. I was just
about to figure out what is my &lt;em&gt;expected profit&lt;/em&gt; using probability
theory. To do that, I use my historical performance data to calculate my
probability of profitable trades. I've been calculating my trading
statistics in my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/monthly-review/"&gt;monthly reviews&lt;/a&gt;, so it's just a matter of
aggregating all the monthly data to a single number. After a few
keystrokes, I find that my win/loss percentages are roughly 40%/60%.
Given my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-2/"&gt;known reward/risk ratio&lt;/a&gt; (discussed in part 2) and
probability of win (40% as noted above), we can calculate a net return
expectancy. This is a simple formula if you know statistics and
confusing if you don't. So I'll just write it out as is but do refer to
the Wikipedia on&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"&gt;statistical expectancy&lt;/a&gt; if you'd like to know more
about how I derived this. Expected net return per trade = (Average
Reward from Step 1 - Commission) * (Probability of Win from Step 2) -
[(Risked Amount + Commission) * (1 - Probability of Win)] This formula
is the result we seek. We apply the forumula to extend the cost-benefit
table presented last time. Here's a complete cost-benefit table using
the parameters of a \$5000 principal balance, \$5 commission, capital
gain tax of 17.5% (half of marginal tax rate), reward/win ratio of 2.0,
and a 40% winning rate. It likely that you'll have different parameters
than me. So I am &lt;a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AnZW_RfDqK11dG5jVzUwbDIxWEQ5aFV3cjVRdU5BbFE&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;sharing my spreadsheet here&lt;/a&gt; so that you can use
your own parameters for your own set of results. Download it in your
preferred format and then edit the values under the Parameters column.
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/contact/"&gt;Contact me&lt;/a&gt; if you have any problem using it. I will discuss the
result and make [my conclusion in the next and final post in this TFSA
trading cost-benefit analysis series][]. Hint: Short answer to the
title's question is NO. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

rate"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/TFSA_trading_cost-benefit_analysis.png" /&gt;][][/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calculation Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested, let's calculate one data point of the table above
using all the the steps discussed so far in this series. Using \$10 risk
(0.2% of \$5000) as an example. Known data: risk = \$10, commission
(comm) = \$5, reward/risk = 2.0, probability of win = 40% Round-trip
commission = \$5 x 2 = \$10 Average Reward = risk * (reward/risk) =
\$20 x (2.0) = \$20 Expected net profit = (Average Reward from Step 1 -
Commission) * (Probability of Win from Step 2) - [(Risked Amount +
Commission) * (1 - Probability of Win)] = (\$20 - \$10) * (40%) -
[(\$10 + \$10) * (1 - 40%)] = 10 * 0.4 - [\$20 * 0.6] = -\$8 If I
risk only \$10 on a trade, it is expected that I would &lt;strong&gt;lose&lt;/strong&gt; \$8 on
average based on my historical trading performance statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

the[costs of a TFSA trading account using data from my recent forex
trading][] (&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/"&gt;forex trading is not allowed in a TFSA&lt;/a&gt;, by the way) as a
hypothetical case study. I conclude that even if I can trade in my best
month, every month, I would still lose money in a TFSA because of the
high relative commission versus a limited principal balance. In this
second part of the series, I use my recent trading performance data to
compare trading a TFSA trading account with a non-registered trading
account (i.e. with capital gain tax). Feel free to &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-4/"&gt;skip to my
conclusion in Part 4&lt;/a&gt; if you don't care for the calculations. As I
said in my previous post, the key problem with a Questrade TFSA trading
account is the commission with respect to the small contribution limit
(\$5000 per year). The only way out of this is to risk more on each
trade such that the commission isn't as big as a portion of your cost
anymore. I normally risk 0.2% on each trade. In a \$5000 account, that
is \$10 risked per trade. With a commission of \$5 per trade, a
round-trip commission would also be \$10. So my total risk has doubled.
But if I increase my risk to 0.5% of my account, or \$25 per trade. A
\$10 commission is reduced to 40% of my total trading risk. As you can
imagine, a cost analysis spreadsheet is starting to take shape. It's
obvious that the more you risk on a trade (not a suggestion), the less
the effect of commission have on you because the commission is a fixed
cost. This isn't telling us anything useful so far. So let's take this a
step further by conducting a cost-benefit analysis. For that, we compare
net profits from a taxed trading account versus a tax-free trading
account. Consider the reward with respect to the risk per trade. Step 1.
Given each risk amount (e.g. 0.2%), what is my typical reward? In other
words, what is my reward/risk ratio in trading? That's easy for me to
identify as I've been keeping detailed &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/"&gt;records of my trading&lt;/a&gt;. Based
on my data from recent months, my reward/risk ratio is around 2.0. For
example, with a risk amount of 0.2% per trade, my average reward is 0.4%
per trade. Step 2. I find out how much capital gain tax I'm paying on
profit per trade. The capital gain tax in Canada is half the marginal
tax rate. Say my marginal tax rate is 35%, my capital gain tax is
effectively 17.5% because it is halved. So any profit which I derived
from a trade is taxed 17.5%. Step 3. Repeat steps 1-2 for each risk and
reward values. Putting the results into a table, we get the following.
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="361" caption="Risk amount vs.
capital gain tax table"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/TFSA-risk-tax-table.png" /&gt;][][/caption] Because the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/"&gt;Questrade TFSA
trading account&lt;/a&gt; (affiliate link) is tax free, the column of tax
amount is also representative of the saved dollar between a TFSA and a
regular trading account. As such, given a total commission of \$10 for a
trade. We can see from the table that the tax saved is more than the
commission for anything greater than a \$30 risk (\$60 profit) amount.
In more general terms, here's my first finding in this case study. Given
a reward/risk ratio of 2.0, the money saved per &lt;strong&gt;winning&lt;/strong&gt; trade in a
TFSA trading account will be better than the commission paid if I risk
more than \$30 per trade, or the average reward per trade is more than
\$60. Notice I highlighted the word "winning". This is merely the first
part of a cost-benefit analysis. Unless you can win 100 percent of the
time, we need to take into account the money lost when trades don't go
as planned (more often than not). We still pay commissions on top of the
risked amount for all losing trades. That needs to be factored into our
cost-benefit analysis. In my next post in this &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/cost-analysis/"&gt;cost analysis&lt;/a&gt; series,
I will &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-3/"&gt;wrap up my calculations&lt;/a&gt; by incorporating simple probability
theory to derive my &lt;em&gt;expected profit&lt;/em&gt; after all is said and done.&lt;/p&gt;

account&lt;/a&gt;. In this series of posts, I will take the other side of the
debate. That is, to answer this simple question, with a \$5,000 initial
deposit, is a TFSA trading account a cost effective means to allocate
your asset? &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-2/"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-3/"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt; of this series discuss my
derivation of a spreadsheet to do the job. &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-4/"&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt; is the conclusion
along with a free interactive spreadsheet that I made so that you can
get your own results with a few keystrokes. The first step in any
trading or investing is to consider your costs. After all, trading is a
business and your bottom line is well... your bottom line (cue eye
rolls). Every penny added to your costs means that you'll just have to
perform that much better to overcome it. Easier said than done. As such,
here is my cost analysis in response to my previous post about the
Questrade TFSA trading account, in particular. Feel free to use this as
a guideline for your own cost analysis if you're considering &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/"&gt;opening a
Questrade TFSA trading account&lt;/a&gt; (affiliate link) yourself. We each
have our own unique financial picture so this cost analysis is merely a
peek from my personal perspective. Here goes my calculations and
rationales. The minimal commission on stock trades is \$5 at Questrade.
A \$5 commission may not seem much to most people. But consider this.
For a \$5000 account, \$5 is 0.1%. On a basic single-lot round-trip (buy
and then sell, all shares at once) trade, the total commission is \$5 x
2 = \$10. Thus, I will be 0.2% behind in my account on each and every
trade! Yes, 0.2% is a small number. However, take a look at my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/"&gt;trading
log&lt;/a&gt; from my recent &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/"&gt;forex trades&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see that I made more
than 10% in 4 months by taking 0.2% here and 0.3% there. In fact, if we
consider the statistics from&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/october-2009-trading-performance-review/"&gt;my best forex trading month last year&lt;/a&gt;,
my average net profit percentage per trade is 0.12%. I totalled 4.19%
net profit on that particular month by raking in a lot of those +0.12%
trades. As you can see, a 0.2% commission would effectively break my
profitable system. So conclusion #1. I cannot trade my TFSA with the
same &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/"&gt;trading strategy&lt;/a&gt; as my forex trading. In other words, no
aggressive day and swing trading. In my next post in this cost analysis
series, I will see if I can find an &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-2/"&gt;cost optimal risk amount to use per
trade&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/"&gt;Questrade TFSA trading account&lt;/a&gt;. And if I can't justify it, well, bye bye TFSA
trading!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="cost analysis"></category><category term="Questrade"></category><category term="tax"></category><category term="TFSA"></category></entry><entry><title>Not pay trading income taxes through a TFSA trading account</title><link href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-02-19T10:12:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Paul Lam</name></author><id>tag:www.quantisan.com,2010-02-19:not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;RRSP contribution deadline on March 1st is fast approaching. Like most
Canadians, this is pretty much the only time when I give my&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_Retirement_Savings_Plan"&gt;Registered
Retirement Savings Plan&lt;/a&gt; some attention. Right now, my RRSP balance
stands at \$0. That's right, nothing. I've been putting my money at work
for 10 years trading all sorts of markets but willfully ignoring the
biggest cost to any trader. Taxes. Now that my marginal tax rate is for
the first time running above 30%, and with no tax break in sight, it's
time that I take a hard look at my tax strategies to reduce my trading
costs. Don't worry, this isn't yet another post about RRSP. (But if
you're indeed looking for RRSP information, I point you to a Canadian
personal finance blog, &lt;a href="http://www.milliondollarjourney.com/"&gt;MillionDollarJourney&lt;/a&gt;) The reason why I
haven't placed money into my RRSP is same as why I don't invest in real
estates. Which is, a lack of liquidity. As the name suggest, RRSP is for
retirement. Here's the problem simplistically put. If I take money out
while I'm still working, I get taxed at my full marginal tax rate for
those money. Even if they were supposed to be capital gain. Thus I
effectively lose my 50% tax discount from my investment capital gain. So
money into my RRSP would effectively be locked in while my salary is
still my main source of income! I don't have a wad of cash where I can
just stash away yet. So that's why my RRSP stands at \$0 this year.
Although I am thinking of opening an RRSP soon... But I digressed. The
fact is, taxes in Canada is ridiculously high. So I need to do something
about it soon. While looking for RRSP information, I came across
Questrade's Tax Free Trading Account. It is a reincarnation of the &lt;a href="http://www.tfsa.gc.ca/"&gt;Tax
Free Savings Account&lt;/a&gt;. As far as I know, Questrade is the only
discount broker offering this type of account. Basically, it is a
trading account in which there is no income taxes involved and any
profit taken out would not count towards annual income too. Sounds too
good to be true? Here are 3 limitations for a TFSA trading account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit of \$5,000 contribution per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extra costs for trading the U.S. markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash account only, no margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will discuss #2 shortly. But #3 is what matters the most to me as a
trader. No margin means no leverage, no shorting, and no futures and
forex trading. No shorting?! One-way trading is not a good thing for a
trader. This is obviously a ploy to get people to buy, buy, buy. And no
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/"&gt;forex trading&lt;/a&gt;?! Yet, I can't expect to have my cake and eat it too.
Yes, this TFSA trading thing has strings attached. But. It's tax-free!
That's enough incentive for me to consider incorporating it into my
portfolio. Make no mistake, this will not be my primary, or even
secondary, trading account. My plan is to use it as an
&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;ultra-conservative&lt;/span&gt;
investment vehicle only. It's about time that I replace my abysmal 1%
yield savings account! Before&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade"&gt;opening a Questrade TFSA trading
account&lt;/a&gt; (affliate link) though, I need to do my homework on Canadian
stocks. Because TFSA is a Canadian government offer, trading U.S.
markets would incur extra costs (a devious way of "Buy Canadian"). As
such, the only cost effective way for me to maximize a TFSA trading
account is to trade TSX and TSX Ventures stocks. This is yet another
item on my to-do list. Come up with a strategy to trade this account
&lt;strong&gt;with minimal risks&lt;/strong&gt; (can't stress this enough)using Canadian stocks.
I actually have some ideas already. But I'll save that for another time.
In my next series of posts, I ask a fundamental investment question like
any trader should. Is a \$5000 Questrade TFSA trading account cost
effective? P.S. For more information on Questrade, youngandthrifty.ca

latest global financial debacle, I am suddenly awashed with a feeling of
hopelessly powerless to this gross unfairness. In which the average,
hard working citizens are pouring money into the pockets of the filthy
and uber rich. If you don't know what I'm talking about here, watch the
video attached below for the tip of the ice berg in this on-going
problem. While Goldman is arguably the best at "legalized stealing" from
the moms and pops, they aren't the only crook on the block. Governments
around the world (not just the U.S.) were handing out money publicly
left and right in the past few months. And many still are. The whole
system is rigged as &lt;a href="http://www.caracommunity.com"&gt;Bill Cara&lt;/a&gt; has opined countless times in the last
few years. Bill's ingenious move to relocate his operation to the
Bahamas is only starting to shine in these months (to me). In addition
to voting with your ballot (which is useless if the whole system is
rigged), we can vote with our tax money by relocating our financial
operation. However, for those of us that still rely on a day job, this
is not an option. The best I can do right now is to become adequate with
managing our own money instead of depending on the financial salesmen.
This doesn't seem enough for me as the balance of power appears to be
getting worse by the day. Our government grossly tax us on one hand and
hand them out to the rich and well connected in the other. What have
others done/plan to do with regard to this unfair trap us working bees
are stuck in? The first video is Ratigan explaining how Goldman Sachs
made \$3 billions in 3 months (tipped by Stop Investing blog). The
second video is an interview with Michael Moore and Ratigan about where
all these loots are going now.&lt;/p&gt;
