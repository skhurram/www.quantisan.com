&lt;p&gt;I'm using the intra-day ATR as a risk factor because I'm assuming them
as noise. I use 10 min. as the basis because that's about the time
period I use. The reward is the max daily swing, which is the daily ATR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
As you can see, the reward/risk is about the same for all the liquid
index futures. However, I'm leaning toward YM because of the smaller
contract size and it seems more stable lately. I'll watch the markets
closely from now on.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="EMD"></category><category term="er2"></category><category term="ES"></category><category term="YM"></category></entry><entry><title>Day trading report Jan 25, 2008: -$140</title><link href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-trading-report-jan-25-2008-140/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-25T17:07:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Paul Lam</name></author><id>tag:www.quantisan.com,2008-01-25:day-trading-report-jan-25-2008-140/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5pPqxzQQaI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/3wMCZ4ZRvTw/s400/ymday.jpg" /&gt;][]The keltner + stochastic strategy seems good. However, I still
lost money today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two reasons really:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my stops are too tight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YM is too choppy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have cut down on erraneous trades but the false positives on the long
side today caught me many times. I don't think I'll be trading the Dow
from now on. Furthermore, the more I day trade, the more I want to
develop a trading system for mechanical trading. Day trading is giving
me experience and ideas for new strategies. I will get back on
programming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I have enabled CME data and will try the ER2 next week. I decided to
move to ER2 like I've always planned on. The only reason I haven't done
so earlier is that the stake is a lot higher there. But if I can trade
better there, then it'll be better than letting YM eat up a bit here and
a bit there even though it's \$5/pt. On the same day, here's the graph
for ER2. Notice that it's much nicer and fewer false signals, aka MM
traps.&lt;/p&gt;

it'd be another down day. But most traders know better. We might be at a
short term bottom at the moment because of the Fed intervention. By
about noon, the market bottomed out to a new low and started to pick up.
The rally went into full gear at almost exactly 3pm (ET) on a rally with
little breathing room for short covering. This was quite expected and
the signals were clear after the noon bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is where I was caught. My first 2 hours of trading were
great. I was up over \$200. Then in the mid-day, even when I was right
about the direction of the market, I ended up down about \$350 because
of all the choppy actions. In addition, I should be more confident of my
belief in a rally because of the obvious uptrend. Yet, the market acted
as if it's going to plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the graph above, I got into many trades in the
middle of the day. But not all of them were losing trades. I saw that
the market was in a trading range and profitted from fading the
breakouts. That made me a bit of money, but a few bad trades got me into
the negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't too happy to see my account under \$15,000 in the afternoon.
However, one thing I did well was regain my composure and got back into
the game with a clear mind. I had put my lost behind and only strived to
minimize risk in my later trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, near the end of the day, a real rally broke out as
expected. I didn't get excited and chased the price. Instead, I waited
my opportunity on a retracement and got into a long. That one last trade
made back all my loses. Even though my short term entry and exit were ok
on this trade. I should have entered another long position on the 2nd
retracement for the 2nd longer leg in the rally to double up on my long
position. I could have made at least another \$1000 or so if I had done
that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;So three lessons from today&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't waste my time on low reward trade. Only enter trades if I
    expect the reward to be a few times (at least 3) more than my stop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful in the mid-day when only the pros are swimming. Better
    yet, only trade in first 2 and last 1 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I am right, raise the stake in the pot! i.e. average up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The market was bound for a small rally. So the Dow moved from a negative
400 something point to almost breakeven and then closed down a 100 pts.
There were many wild swings today. Many opportunities for a day trader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I seem to have done well today, I think I could have done a lot
better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5avoBzQQOI/AAAAAAAAAIc/8w-84LbudSE/s400/ym_day.jpg" /&gt;][]Even though I knew the Dow is going to go up at least 200 pts
from open, I only captured about 150 points of it. I was hesitating a
lot after my winnings because I worried about losing my profits like I
did before. I need to be objective in my rationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the later day action were a lot choppier and the ATR were a lot
higher. Staying on the sideline may be a good decision. For my later
trades in a volatile setting, I may want to increase my stop because I
have missed a few good trades even though I was ultimately right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, my exits were a lot better today. I wasn't bagholding
nor was I ragholding. I got out when I should rather I was winning or
losing. In addition, my tight trailing stop method saved me a few times.
Although it did got me out too early a few times too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have adopted this new screen which I developed over the
weekend. It's based on the triple screen strategy by Dr. Alexander
Elder. The big window is for my main time frame. Then two more charts
for a 5x higher and another for a 5x shorter time frames. I only enter a
trade when all 3 (at least the lower 2's) are in sync. Then I exit when
either the short or current time period shows weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

I was
expecting that Bush's speech on a stimulus package would cause a mini
rally to squeeze the shorts. So I kept entering trades on the Buy
signals. As you can see from the graph, it didn't happen. Stupid me. The
parameter is definitely too loose at the moment on the Buy signal. I
have adjusted it now and it seems to be a bit better (fewer false
positives).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also shouldn't read too much into comments from Bill Cara's blog. Both
times I went against my own judgement because of reading too much of
other people's comments led to big losses. Lesson is to
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;never have any expectation of the
market&lt;/span&gt;. See what the price is doing and interpret it based on
that, and that alone. End of story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, I think I'm down about a \$500 from my YM day trading for the
past couple of weeks. If there's any consolation, I think my system is
improving from these failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5ET1PY4uxI/AAAAAAAAAH8/AOLruM5p-P0/s400/ym_day.jpg" /&gt;]: http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5ET1PY4uxI/AAAAAAAAAH8/AOLruM5p-P0/s1600-h/ym_day.jpg&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="day trading"></category><category term="YM"></category></entry><entry><title>YM day trading result for Jan 17, 2008: +$303</title><link href="http://www.quantisan.com/ym-day-trading-result-for-jan-17-2008-303/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-01-17T15:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Paul Lam</name></author><id>tag:www.quantisan.com,2008-01-17:ym-day-trading-result-for-jan-17-2008-303/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4-s9PY4uuI/AAAAAAAAAHk/6bblNJTEapQ/s400/ym_day.jpg" /&gt;][] Today is less volitile. I'm also using a higher contract count
to filter out the noise. It's also because I found that I'm not quick
trigger enough on fast times. I'm using 1200 contracts/bar at the
moment. It seems to be good. I'm also a lot more disciplined today. Not
over trading and sticking to my strategy. At the very least, my recent
loses have given me valuable experiences in day trading. Also, the floor
pivot points have been very reliable so far. The price seems to like to
bounce around these levels or settle in a range near them. Very useful
in identifying breakouts or exhaustions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some changes I added to my day trading screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented my CCI and Stochastic strategy into a PaintBar with
    alarms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Stochastic crossing of oversold or overbought as ShowMe with
    alarms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased contracts/bar to 1200 contracts / bar for slower time
    frame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added trailing stop Auto Strategy to pull the trigger for me (but
    doesn't seem to be working)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decreased stop to 10 points on YM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Never chase the price!&lt;/span&gt; It's
    ok to miss some opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only buy at the good end of the immediate trading range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Do chase the price with a trailing
    stop!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New money management technique: once price started to move in
    favoured direction, move stop to 2 points ahead of entry price to
    cover costs and then trail it with the price with some margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#8 has been particularly useful today. I was wrong a couple of times in
my entry but was able to breakeven because of it. Such that even being
wrong wouldn't lose me money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Update: the market is down a lot and it seems to be oversold. I got in a
long position near the bottom (or so I thought). This could lose me \$50
if it keeps going down after this consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update 2: I indeed did enter at near the bottom and my initial stopped
of 10 pts (\$50) were never touched. Then the price just shot up to the
resistance as expected. I gradually moved my stop to trail the price
move. This trade played out as I have planned. I made a quick \$120 or
so in the few minutes. I thought of reversing direction and go short
too. But I didn't want to push for luck for the day. However, the price
is now moving down as I have guessed. It might make a new low too. Oh
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a graph a few minutes after my last trade.&lt;/p&gt;

the news. WSJ is reporting inflation is at 17 year high. Boeing is also
delaying their 787 delivery. So many bad news indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the Dow decides to be up today. The futures gapped lower, but it
was quickly closed to yesterday's close. I saw that one coming from the
CCI and Stoch and was able to profit on the brief rally. It seemed
obvious that the MM are positioning themselves for the big fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I exited the long and went short on very good timing. Then the market
went on a free fall for an hour. I was holding 2 shorts of YM (one for
long term entered at market top and another one for short term, which
was added on an early consolidation). The paper profit amounted to
almost \$1300 for that hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself counting the profit and becoming ecstatic of the gain.
This is when my discipline lost to my conviction. CCI and Stochastic
were obviously turning upward. I originally intended the 2nd short
position to be short term only. If I stuck to my strategy, I should have
exited at least one position when the signals were staring at my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was indeed the bottom for the day. The market recovered and
actually went higher. This is due to the HB&amp;amp;B moving funds (gold, tech,
oil, etc) back into the financials. They are in fact
&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;rotating funds out of each sector&lt;/span&gt;
one at a time so that the indexes don't tank too fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was so smart to call the first rally a fakeout, I totally forgot
the same could be done on the other end! It was a double trap!!! Fake
rally, fake fall, then finally settle near prev close. This is because
most "news" from today were already discounted in the previous few days'
drop in DJIA. Buy on rumour, sell on the news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued to trade after the big lost hoping to recover. I kept on
going short near the top but the Dow kept breaking it. After a while, I
finally dawned on me. I went long on the bottom and made a little bit
back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I was down about \$500 to \$600 on YM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I re-learned/realized is that the morning are amateurs'
market. The afternoon are the pro's market. At least, it seems easier to
trade because there seem to be less noise in the mornings for the past
few days. My strategy seemed to have worked better in the morning too.
I'll focus on the first hour or two of the market from now on and see if
this hypothesis is true.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a very
good call, on both entry and exit timing. I went in as TRIX is above
zero and slowing down. Stochastic slow has just crossed its MA line.
Also the 5 min chart shows similar reveral signals from overbought zone.
In addition, the fundamental was good because yesterday's up run was
overzealous and unjustified (Bernanke's hint of rate cut in Feb) in a
sea of financial troubles lately. All signs pointed that today's market
would be down and the charts showed a good opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I exited when the stochastic bearly showed sign of upturn. The price
rebounded slightly. Another less probability chance for short came on
the 2nd mid level Stochastic cross under. I could have re-entered after
a small bounce at that point and made a lot more on the 2nd wave. Lesson
learned. When the stars are aligned, it's good to be greedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4hBmfY4ugI/AAAAAAAAAF0/Lok-FjE2Bm4/s400/ym_day.jpg" /&gt;][] I'm using TRIX and Stochastic Slow now. CCI gives more or less
the same signal as Stochastic but lags a bit more, so I got rid of it.
TRIX seems to complement Stochastic well because it gives a trend. I've
been working on a new system. It also has a few new tricks too. Such as
a window of opportunity feature so both signals doesn't have to happen
on exactly the same bar for the conditions to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched the market for a while today but didn't make any trade
afterward. I didn't want to lose my winner from today. Plus, I prefer to
use an automatic system. So I continued to develop my new TRIX +
Stochastic system today based on these 2 days' experience.&lt;/p&gt;

experience while I develop my auto system. The market I've chosen is YM
(mini Dow) for the short term, ZG (CBOT Gold) for the longer term, and
Corn for the long long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YM is on CBOT, so I wouldn't have to shell out another \$55 for the
NYMEX data. It's also a more popular/mature market than ER2 so I can
obtain fundamental analysis easier to complement my technical analysis.
The recent price action is also very predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the marked spot on the left graph is a potential strategy.
Notice the breakdown of the TRIX corresponds with an imminent breakdown
of the price. This is just one example. But observing price pattern and
TRIX pattern seems to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my other two choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold is hot at the moment, so there could be huge swings. It's now
around \$890 and I'm expecting a correction based on the fundamentals.
I'll watch the price pattern and indicators to time my entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn is on a run for the past 3 months. It has low margin requirement
(\~\$1000) and the price are quite consistent. So waiting for
breakout/down can riding the trend could be a long term profitable
trade.&lt;/p&gt;
