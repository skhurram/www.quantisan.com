stopped out at breakeven this morning. In fact, the pair is still
struggling around the descending resistance line as shown in Figure 1.
It made a higher low so I won't be surprised if it cracks higher.

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I took this trade was that the opportunity seemed too
good to pass on &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/short-usdcad-1-0654-stop-1-077/"&gt;based on my analysis at the time&lt;/a&gt;. I
always keep an eye on the market even when I'm not trading. Although the
basic setup remains intact, the opportunity isn't so fantastic that I
couldn't say no anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I shouldn't be wasting time managing a minuscule trade. Back to
staring at codes.&lt;/p&gt;

studying the market&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/"&gt;paper trading&lt;/a&gt;. Shorted USDCAD based on
the following intermarket observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yesterday's equities sell-off held around S&amp;amp;P at 1050&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overnight Asian market seem orderly, not every market followed
    through, but most did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European markets down move were slow overnight until US open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But perhaps most importantly, EUR/USD made a higher low with an
    increasing COT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, as much as the sell-off tries to scare off people, the
markets don't seem to be moving in unison. So it would seem this move
(in equities, thus inverse USD) is still a bear trap in an intermediate
term bull rally. Plus this daily chart, Figure 1, for picking USDCAD
specifically. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

0.05% of capital with a hard stop at 1.077. Anything above 1.070 would
put me on alert though. Coincidentally, I first got into the forex
market by studying the loonie. Let's see how this first trade performs.&lt;/p&gt;

the top. It was a lucky move, that's all. Now it looks as though CAD/JPY
will do one of the following: &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break down from here. A break below 86.50 will confirm an
    intermediate term downtrend. However, I don't expect CAD/JPY to spin
    on a dime right after testing an obvious resistance. So I think #2
    is more likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False breakdown to above 86.50, retrace to 88.00, and hang around
    this range for a few more days then initiate an intermediate term
    price fall (#1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although unlikely, case #3 is still possible. CAD/JPY can remain
    suppressed at this 87 price level and creep upward deviously to test
    89.30.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between #1 and #2 could be subtle. But I couldn't bank
on either one yet because the reward/risk isn't favourable at this
moment. So I'm going to stay on the sideline and wait for a better price
or for the signs to be clearer. On another note, I'm still keeping an
eye on gold and &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/AUD/"&gt;Aussie&lt;/a&gt;. There should be a big one soon.&lt;/p&gt;

It broke through
88.00 nicely and tested 88.50 on Tokyo open just now. I decided to book
my profit in the demo account on this CAD/JPY long position entered at
86.88 and 87.87. See Figure 1 for the 3-hour chart with the entries and
exits marked. Main reason for my cold feet is that there's a lot of
resistance on CAD/JPY above 88.50, all the way to 90.70, from the daily
chart (not shown). I couldn't tell if CAD/JPY will continue pushing
upward or retrace. So I'm booking my profit now to observe the price
action from the sideline. This position has turned out +40 pips more
than I expected, so I'm trying not to be too greedy in this volatile
time. The net profit on this &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/"&gt;paper trade&lt;/a&gt; amounts to +0.3% of my demo
account. The yellow triangle in Figure 1 shows my exit. I risked 0.1% on
the initial entry (first blue triangle). Then added 70% more to the
position above a weak resistance level (second blue triangle) and moved
the stop on the initial size to breakeven.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a
continuation of my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-usdcad-short-1-0540-for-131-pips/"&gt;previous USDCAD short&lt;/a&gt; position. However, USDJPY
is on a run upward so I'm switching to go long on the loonie with yen
instead. Figure 1 shows the daily chart of CADJPY. Notice the imminent
MACD bullish crossover and the already in-play stochastic upturn. I like
it. My stop loss level is set at 86.10. It's the high of a previous peak
on February 3, two weeks ago. My target is the round number 88
resistance. 88.0 has been an important price level for CADJPY for the
past few months. So I'm setting my sight there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="CADJPY,
daily"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-02-17-cadjpy_d.gif" /&gt;][][/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows my timing for this entry. CADJPY is noticeably meeting
some resistance at 87.50. 87.50 is also the 61.8% Fibonacci level of a
recent down move. This is a cause for concern on my long position as we
could very well retrace here. However, the bullishness of CADJPY is
apparent in Figure 2. Prices have consistently been bought for the past
few days right on the short term moving average (teal line).
Furthermore, the intermediate term moving average (orange line) is about
to cross the long term moving average (red line) as I enter this
position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, gold price has taken a dive from 1130 to 1100. Meanwhile, crude
oil price is holding the 77 support nicely. Thus, this confirm my
previous view that &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-change-of-wind-for-australian-dollar-shorted-audusd-0-9183-and-audcad-0-9546/"&gt;oil has better upside than gold&lt;/a&gt; in the
intermediate term. Which is why I've been trading the loonie these past
weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this particular CADJPY trade, I have another buy order waiting above
current support level to add to my long position. Let's see if CADJPY
can break decisively to the upside in the next 24 hours as US and
Canadian data comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

few times. My decision last week to &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-short-target-hit-1-0581-trying-something-new-to-hold-for-longer/"&gt;hold this for longer&lt;/a&gt; after
USDCAD touched my target paid off. I moved my stop closer last Thursday
evening and the order got filled on Friday. However, as I type this on
the following Monday, USDCAD is trading even lower at 1.0478. It looks
as though my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/"&gt;original target of 1.0415&lt;/a&gt; is in the cards. Even though
this is a profitable trade with a 0.17% gain in my demo account, there
is one major flaw with this short USDCAD play. I was not able to squeeze
more out of this profitable move. As I've said, this short took a few
tries. In fact, if we consider all the entires and exits of this play.
My stopped out losses totaled 0.29% and my single win here is merely
0.17%. So I'm actually at a net loss of 0.12% from all these work. My
win/loss rate is about 40% based on my review of recent forex trades. I
was able to edge out more than &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/"&gt;10% profit in four months&lt;/a&gt; because
when I am wrong, I take small steps. But when I'm right, I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/"&gt;pile into a
position&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since my trading environment has changed, I've been
trying to trade a longer timeframe. This USDCAD short is my first
attempt on a new strategy. Evidently, I will need to re-think and
re-learn what I've become accustomed to in the past few months. One of
the necessary trait of a successful trader is to be able to adapt.
Markets change. Traders need to evolve with the markets or they will
become obsolete. This will be a good test of myself to see if I can
re-invent myself to adapt to a changing trading environment. [caption

A mere 5 pips difference. &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/"&gt;This position&lt;/a&gt; is now +79 pips on paper. I
moved my stop to breakeven last night. Normally, I would have covered
most, if not all, of the position at this point. But I'll hold onto the
full amount this time. For now. Reasons are as follow. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USDCAD likes to grind out both bulls and bears at obvious levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/"&gt;down move that I'm seeing&lt;/a&gt; is still in an early
    stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My position is too small to be worthwhile if I take profit now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of my recent performance shows that I often don't ride my
    winners long enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I must learn to adopt a longer term strategy now that I [can't trade
    as often][].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, Figure 1 shows what I mean by #2.&lt;/p&gt;

to add to this position. As long as USDCAD stays below 1.0645, I'm
confident (not exactly the right word though) with this down move. From
this point onward, it's new territory for me as I push beyond my comfort
zone. Is this an ill-fated move or a spark of insight? Let me know what
you think about this extended trade. Update February 15: I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-usdcad-short-1-0540-for-131-pips/"&gt;closed this

USDCAD continued on a rampage upward and I was
caught on the wrong side of the fence. Total loss for this was 0.12% of
my account. At least I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/"&gt;was light in it&lt;/a&gt;. In retrospect, I broke my
own rule and didn't enter at one of the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/"&gt;4 fundamental entry points&lt;/a&gt;.
However, after some bear rampage throughout the markets today
(Bloomberg: [Stocks Plunge on Concern Rising Debt, Job Losses Threaten
Global Recovery][]), USDCAD is at the top of my channel as shown in
Figure 1 below. So while my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/"&gt;previous entry&lt;/a&gt;
was early. USDCAD at this price is a good short. I will take it slow
this time by setting a limit order below current support on the 4-hour
at 1.0680, with a stop at 1.0750. And then adding a second chunk at
1.0640, my stopped out price. As is customarily lately, I am only
risking 0.1% of my account on the initial order. On a weekly chart,
1.0750 to 1.0810 is obviously a strong resistance for the USDCAD. It is
a congestion zone in 2007 and 2008. Then USDCAD spent the last quarter
of 2009 trying to break this resistance to no avail. But who knows,
perhaps USDCAD has had enough and it will break this resistance
decisively soon. That's why I'm only betting on this reversal with
