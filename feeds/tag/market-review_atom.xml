less on the day-to-day market action and more on my own trading
development. Besides working on my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/"&gt;quantitative research&lt;/a&gt;, one of the
tasks that I like to do is to review what I have thought previously in a
similar time. This takes us back to a year ago, August of 2009.
Headlines from &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2009/08/"&gt;my fifteen posts back then&lt;/a&gt; shows that I was trying
desperately (in hindsight) to short the market. Why would I do that?
Take a look at this 3-year long weekly chart of S&amp;amp;P500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="S&amp;amp;P500 weekly
chart"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-08-18-SPX_wkly.png" /&gt;][][/caption] On the chart, August 2009 looked like a great
shorting opportunity. The resistance level at 1000 seem too good to be
true (it was). In fact, I said the following words on August 22, 2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been much talk of economic recovery and
a new bull market is already with us, I still am not convinced just
yet. True, the bears might be MIA. But all signs say that this bull
weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re seeing is standing on thin ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How wrong I was. Since breaking the 1000 resistance back then, the S&amp;amp;P
hitched on the bull train to steam upward steadily on to 1150 (Figure
1). It took a break there and continued on to 1207. Looking through my
trades back then, I eventually stopped shorting the market after S&amp;amp;P
broke above 1025. That was the good part. The bad part is that I wasn't
able to change my view and remained stubbornly bearish (but at least
didn't commit to any new shorts) for weeks afterward. If I were to sum
up my lesson in the past year, here's what I would say to myself back in
August 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading is not about being right. It is about knowing when you are
wrong &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; doing something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a final note, it was in August of last year that I started to paper
trade the forex market. I can't believe it has been a whole year
already!&lt;/p&gt;
