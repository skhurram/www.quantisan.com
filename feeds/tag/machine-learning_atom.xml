Here are the [complete 20
lectures for CS 229 Machine Learning from Stanford University][] for my
own record. I have learned most of the material before, but have
forgotten most of it already. In particular, the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCqPMD6coO8"&gt;last lecture&lt;/a&gt; talks
about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POMDP"&gt;POMDP&lt;/a&gt;. I have always thought it would be a great tool to be
applied on a financial trading system. Long story short, POMDP is a
distinctive machine learning algorithm because it inherently assumes the
'world' is partially-observable (MDP on its own takes care of the
uncertainty part). A drawback with using artificial intelligence in
trading is that A.I. are good for closed ended system but bad for open
ended ones (i.e. trading). I believe POMDP can be worked on to become a
valuable trading system. I haven't tried implementing it myself yet
because of lack of a good platform and data. But since POMDP has been
around for years now, I would assume somebody somewhere has tried this
already. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any information on
this problem. In any case, this post is merely a reminder for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
