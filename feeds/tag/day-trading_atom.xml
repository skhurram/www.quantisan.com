I made 95
pips in two hours at the open with only two trades. This post is a
review of my trades that day for my future reference. To save you and
myself from reading, the two reasons for this good run are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convergence of intermediate term signals with day trading signals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignoring my bearish sentiment (Dubai news) and traded what I saw
    from the prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before moving on, let's start by setting the stage with some background
information to summarize what conditions were like that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news on November 25 after NY close of &lt;a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-and-yen-buoyed-by-safe-haven-flows-2009-11-27"&gt;Dubai World delaying their
debt repayments&lt;/a&gt; sent the dollar and yen soaring. I made &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/audjpy-short-81-3777-17-anatomy-of-my-first-400-pips-trade/"&gt;my first
400+ pips trade&lt;/a&gt; by being at the right place and time on this panic
wave. The U.S. market was closed that day but FTSE sold off more than 3%
the day after the news. So the expectation was for US to do a catch-up
sell off when it opens again on Friday 27th. Risk aversion (equities
down, yen and dollar up) was the talk of the day. Figure 1 below shows
the charts of ES futures (e-mini S&amp;amp;P500). Left is a 1-min. from midnight
of 27th to that morning's NYSE opening. Right is an hourly showing the
move overnight from 26th to 27th.&lt;/p&gt;

S&amp;amp;P 500)&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intermediate term signal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows my intermediate term signal. EURUSD has been printing an
uptrend on the daily (not shown). Figure 2 shows that EURUSD was testing
the bottom of my channel so I should consider going long. Notice that
this is the same channel that called for the 1.5150 top on 25th. At
least it has proven itself useful once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURUSD,
3-hour"][&lt;img alt="EURUSD, 3-hour" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_3h.png" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_3h.png"&gt;EURUSD, 3-hour&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Short term signals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the short term signal, we need to go back to Figure 1 for the ES
charts. ES tanked 40 points over the holiday with very low volume. It
made it all the way to 1067 just before 3am on 27th. Then it lifted all
the way to 1080 at 9am. 1080 is the line in the sand for the bulls and
bears. So retracing all the way to that level before opening is
significant. This pre-open strength in ES was the sign of oversold for
me. This is the short-term confirmation I needed. I entered my first
position to long EURUSD @ 9:09 am to test the water. Then I watched both
EURUSD and ES closely for the next half hour. Once NYSE opened. I
noticed that the TICK was relatively mellow with readings around -250 to
-500. It's unusually good for a -20 points open drop on S&amp;amp;P 500. One
would expect at least -800 readings for a strong negative sentiment. So
after watching EURUSD, ES, and TICK for about 10 minutes, I entered a
second position on a weak retracement at 9:39 am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The exits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my exit, I took profit at 1.5180 because it's the 50% Fibonacci
level and it's also the top of another of my channel (Figures 2 and 3).
After about 10 minutes of watching the 1M bars, EURUSD failed to clear
that resistance, so I took profit on the second half to go flat in this
pair just before 11 am because it's an early-closing Friday (NYSE
closing at 1pm). The gains were +95 and +93 pips for +0.27% and +0.28%
in my demo account total. Not bad for holding for 2 hours. Update:
Thanks to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jlcnuke"&gt;Jeff on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for the question. I updated Figure 3 with
the Fib. levels and showed the top and bottom used to draw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURUSD, 30
min."][&lt;img alt="EURUSD, 30 min." src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_30min.png" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_30min.png"&gt;EURUSD, 30 min.&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I started with an intermediate term setup that aligns with
the major trend. I observed the reaction of the markets on an important
news. Identified an oversold condition from the short-term charts for a
short-term positive divergence signal. Scaled in a position. Then added
more with another confirmation. I scaled out when the target was hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I could have been more aggressive on this trade. As shown in
Figure 3, 1.4920-4930 was a short-term resistance. I could have added
more to my position when that level broke, with a stop at 1.4900.&lt;/p&gt;

consolidation around the area. See Figure 1 for a daily chart of
EUR/CHF. I just happened to be looking at the charts when this breakdown
occurred last night so I made a few day trades. These scalps turned out
better than I thought because a particular technical analysis phenomenon
worked really well on this move. Referring to Figure 2, a 5-min. chart
of the move, you'll notice that I've marked some Fibonacci levels on
each of the big dive in prices. While there are several Fibonacci levels
that are notable and commonly used, I pay attention to the 50%
retracement level almost exclusively. A half retracement is easy to spot
even with the naked eyes without any technical analysis so even those
that don't use Fibonacci can see it. With this hypothesis in mind, I
shorted EURCHF a few times last night on the bounce to 50% of each of
the move. The first entry was at 1.5048. EURCHF retraced about 50% after
that big dive from 1.5080 to 1.5030. Then it formed a descending
triangle on the 1-minute with the support at 5050. A nice round number
support level. The entry was triggered near the end of the triangle and
right when it broke the support. I held on to this short looking for the
move to take us all the way down below 1.5000 since there's bound to be
lots of stops there (which never happend last night probably because of
SNB intervention). Before that though, we made another quick dive and
then retraced 50% again. I shorted some more with a limit order placed
at the 50% level before hand. So I had two positions sitting from 5048
and 5039. See Figure 2 at the bottom for a chart with the levels marked.
However, by the third dive, it is now obvious that the move down is
getting smaller and smaller. Then when the 50% level of that last move
held for like eternity, and numerous tests of resistance at 5030 failing
yet didn't back down by much every time, I took profit at 5027-5028. The
reward/risk ratio were impressive with these trades. I risked a few pips
to make 10-20 pips. However, one mistake I made which made all these
efforts wasted. Simply put, I did not have enough position size to make
these pips gained worthwhile. Being used to swing trades with much
bigger stops, I merely used my usual lot size for these trades. The
reason being that I didn't expect these to go so well since I've always
been burned by day trading and was just testing the water with these
days. Oh well, these could all have been just because I was lucky last
night. In hindsight, I could have saved myself from all that stress and
made a lot more simply by betting on SNB intervention as many traders
have done. Recall [my lesson on fundamental analysis and the SNB pegging
up the EURCHF market][]? Well, last night presented a great opportunity
to profit from that open secret again when EURCHF tested 1.5000. The
reason why I didn't go long is because it was just too obvious that SNB
would come to the rescue. I thought that they would have waited for
running the stops below 1.5000 before intervening (note to self, don't
second guess). Well, it seems that obviousness works. The optimal entry
for a long EURCHF would have started at the point when I covered for the
same reasons. I should have eased in a long position around 1.5030 with
stop at 1.5000. A reasonable profit target would have been 1.5100. Why
1.5100? Aside from that the fact that it's an obvious resistance, this
is just something I noticed while drawing up the chart for this post. In
Figure 2, I've drawn the 161.8 % Fibonacci extension levels for those 3
down moves discussed. See that they formed the reversal targets
perfectly with equally impressive textbook perfect consolidation
reaction afterwards? If the price action adhered to the Fibonacci
retracements so well as described above, it's no surprise that a Fib.
level would work well for the reversal too. Just because the same people
are probably involved with the move down as well as the move up when all
these happened within mere hours. So two lessons from last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should pay more attention to the 161.8% level in my analysis along
    with the 50% level in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more importantly, don't think the central bank (e.g. SNB) will
    not intervene just because everyone is milking them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

So with spare
time on my hands, I had the urge to experiment with day trading the
forex market. Bad decision. After a good 3-4 days of day trading EUR/USD
with my demo account, here is what I have to show as illustrated in my
account balance graph for the past 4 trading sessions below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Account balance
Nov 10-14, 2009"][&lt;img alt="Account balance Nov 10-14, 2009" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-14-account_balance.png" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-14-account_balance.png"&gt;Account balance
Nov 10-14, 2009&lt;/a&gt;[/caption] Yes, you can push back up your dropped jaw
now. I considered not accounting for these losses in my paper trading
account because these trades were meant to be experimental only.
However, as the whole point of me paper trading the forex is to learn
and improve, I decided to keep these losses and suffer the consequences
of my own doing. Heck, I wouldn't have had the choice if this were real
money (which is the way that I should treat this demo account anyway). I
stepped out of my circle of strength (swing trading) into something that
has burned me many times before. Well guess what, &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/1000-in-2-days/"&gt;history does repeat
itself&lt;/a&gt;. Enough with lambasting myself. The real focus of this post is
to point out what I did wrong and what can I do to improve in day
trading the forex. Not that I'm intent on day trading though. This is
merely to increase my arsenal in forex trading. Figuring out what I did
wrong is actually obvious in hindsight. Figure 2 below depicts the
trades I made on Nov 13, which led to most of that steady decline in my
account balance as shown in Fig. 1. See the bounce from about 1.4820? I
kept shorting it and shorting it all the way up to 1.4880. What was I
thinking? The main reason for this epic failure is that I broke a
fundamental rule in trading. &lt;strong&gt;Trade what you see and what you thought&lt;/strong&gt;
(Techniques of Tape Reading by &lt;a href="http://www.realitytrader.com/blog/"&gt;V. Graifer&lt;/a&gt;). Based on the previous
day's market sell-off from 1.5000 and the Asian markets failing to break
1.4900, I thought the market would follow through on Friday and break
through this 1.4820 support. In particular, just before NY open before
9:30am, EUR/USD had a couple of big drops, as shown in Fig. 2. All these
circumstances led to my believe that we'll see a weak day like
yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EUR/USD,
5m"][&lt;img alt="EUR/USD, 5m" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_5m.PNG" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_5m.PNG"&gt;EUR/USD, 5m&lt;/a&gt;[/caption] However, a support is
still a support until it's broken. I shouldn't keep shorting it even
though it has obviously bounced. While identifying the trend is trivial
in hindsight, what evidence did I have at the time to tell me that? The
evidence was in fact staring me in the face that morning. Figure 3 shows
part of the screen that I usually use for intra-day observation. As you
can see, S&amp;amp;P500 rejected the previous day's close with a strong negative
TICK reading and then broke above the morning range. The TICK also
remained strong with many +800 readings in the morning. All the classic
signs that point to a strong positive trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="577" caption="intraday
sentiment"]&lt;img alt="intraday sentiment" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-intraday_am.PNG" /&gt;[/caption] Furthermore, if only I had
stepped back and observed the bigger picture, as shown in Fig. 4 with a
30-minute chart, I would have seen that we have a great positive
divergence swing setup (and which I normally would have exploited if I
weren't so focused on trading the 5m that day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EUR/USD,
30-minute"][&lt;img alt="EUR/USD, 30-minute" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_30m.PNG" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_30m.PNG"&gt;EUR/USD, 30-minute&lt;/a&gt;[/caption] What
is my goal in future day trading? Instead of a declining equity curve as
in Figure 1, just flip it up-side-down and that's what would be perfect.
All I needed to change is being able to spot the right trend and ride
it. Easier said than done. So what is the moral of this story? I have
once again proven that I am still no good at day trading. Stick with
swing trades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned previously &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/"&gt;about avoiding volatility&lt;/a&gt;. But with VIX about
75 now, I couldn't help but to take the opportunity to day trade. I
know, I know, I said I wouldn't do it again. So I'm only trading an
account with&lt;strong&gt;paper money&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the abundance of day trading opportunities these days, I
just launched my trading screen and within minutes I can see a viable
setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 1 minute chart on the left, notice the small doji at \$844 with a
high volume. Also off the chart is a low of \$837 for the day in the
morning. So \$840 is an effective support for the moment. Since the doji
at \$844 is above \$840, this is a good sign for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I placed buy orders around \$845 for the next few minutes and exiting
below \$850 (obvious resistance), with intent to get back later in if it
breaks \$850 strongly. This went on for a few minutes, and I traded in
the range taking small profits twice, until the price broke to \$841.50,
which I stopped at a loss at around \$842.50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, noticing it's in a steady climb from then on, I entered a long
at \$845 again, with stop at \$841, for a longer trade. The price rose
to \$853.75, bounced back to \$850, and started dropping. I exited my
long at a small profit at \$849.50 on a retracement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ES keeps dropping for those seconds until \$845.75 and bounced right
back to \$851. That was a good sign. I believe the initial \$850 break
and retracement was just a technical bounce. So I went in again at \$851
a bit later intending to ride it up to \$860.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That trade went as planned and I exited at \$858. I reversed and went
short at \$861 with a tight stop at \$863. The stop got hit and the
price went up to \$866.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to stop there since the trading screen didn't lean much to
on-the-spot analysis. I'm not asking for a full charting screen though,
that would be overkill for day trading. Simplicity is key. I'd be happy
if they had 1-min and 15 min candlestick charts with 2-line EMA, MACD,
Stochastic, and volume information. In the end, I'm \$162.50 richer in
paper money after 12 trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it's a profitable session, I think I took way too many trades
to reach that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my trading platform is very basic and isn't meant for day trading,
I didn't even have a chart on the trading matrix. I just looked at the
price movements and occasionally flip back to the chart. However, I do
have one good indicator for use... which is the price of Goldman Sachs
(GS). Long story short, we're in a financial driven crisis and GS (along
with MS and others) is one of the two surviving investment banks (of
original 5) in this mess. GS were off the lows of the day and moving up
very slowly throughout the few minutes which I day traded. That was a
good enough bullish sign for me to go long.&lt;/p&gt;

I took &lt;a href="http://wrahal.blogspot.com/2008/02/trading-for-february-21-2008_21.html"&gt;Will Rahal's prediction of a
positive market for the day&lt;/a&gt; a little too much to heart and kept
entering longs even though the market was diving. I was also thinking
that the price would bounce back to the pivot and S1 after breaking it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have noted that the ADX was at 50 and at least wait for a
trading range if I were to enter a long. Because with such dramatic
drop, the price wouldn't turn on a dime. But even better, I could have
entered a short on the initial break below the pivot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons for the day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realize that I'm wrong sooner rather than later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch from ER2 to YM after a few losing streak for a smaller
    position size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't have any pre-conceived notion of where the market will head!
    (not the first time this has cost me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm just \$60 away from my equity limit to exit from day trading.
Although I have learned a lot, I still can't produce result
consistently. Next week will be a vital test for my near term day
trading career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I recall a couple of times
I took a small profit too early instead of waiting for the big runs
afterward. It would have been a great week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb 14, I entered a short on the pre-market. I exited way too early
because the price kept dropping for the rest of the day and most of the
next. Although I knew the price was going to drop, I underestimated the
magnitude of it. &lt;a href="http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2008/02/nyse-tick-using-sentiment-to-trade.html"&gt;TraderFeed wrote an article&lt;/a&gt; about that day's market
and introduced his method of using the NYSE tick count as another
indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have since added it to my day trading window.&lt;/p&gt;

went to bed. I was too tired and found that I wasn't concentrating. My
brain was definitely off already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seriously considered entering a long at about the vertical line. Then
after watching it for a few bars, the price seems to be stuck in a
trading range, so it could go either way. Since I didn't want to wait
for long because I almost fell asleep at the table, I decided to not
enter a position. It was a good decision because the price would have
went below my stop (lowest of past few bars in the trading range) before
rising just a 6 index points, and with a lot of struggle too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the day, there were a lot of choppiness and not a lot of
big swings. It would have been better to stay off the market because my
stops would have been killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I didn't make any profit for the day, I didn't lose any either.
So I think going to bed early last because I wasn't up for it was a wise
decision.&lt;/p&gt;

wait for the right moment. I almost entered my 4th trade but didn't
because I wanted to stick to my rule, at least for the first day.
Luckily, that would have been another losing trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I'm finally learning that it's not worth it to get into small
moves. The reward/risk ratio is usually not good. And those are usually
the emotional trades too, where I somehow convinced myself the price is
going to move that way. [&lt;img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6yCfxzQQ1I/AAAAAAAAANs/jIfly4pLVqg/s400/er2_rpt.jpg" /&gt;][]&lt;/p&gt;

two weeks in Canada. I could blame it on the fact that I'm not used to
trading at night and that I was very tired also because of jet lag.
However, I shouldn't have traded at all if I knew that I wasn't in good
condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the thinking that caused me to trade so many times is that I
didn't want to miss any opportunities. I move in too fast before the
signals are mature. Thus, one thing I need to do is don't guess where
the market is moving. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Let the signals
mature and the price to move a bit first before entering; I don't have
to get in and out at exactly the top and bottom of a swing&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the moment, I am imposing a 3 trades maximum rule to restrain myself
until I'm producing better results and am more disciplined.&lt;/p&gt;

Volume was great and swings were huge too. I
had a good day today and covered my losses from yesterday. Good days
always seem to come after a bad day. I think it's probably because I'm
more calm after a losing day. So now, I just need to maintain my
composure even if I'm up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA had a conference call today and told everyone everything's still
good even though they are reporting a \$2.3bln loss last quarter! Go
figure! Someone at BillCara is suggesting that the fund managers are
proping the market because it's the last day of the month. Just so they
can have a positive January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I traded the pre-market signal as intended and it paid off. The gap
closed as expected but I &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;exited too
early&lt;/span&gt; again. If only I held longer, my profits would have been in
the 4 figures today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did well today, entering trades only when the risk/reward ratio is
deemed worthwhile. In addition, I am making use of resistance and
support levels. I think this helped a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think I need to be quicker on my decision. I found that many
times, I was still pondering should I enter and then the price have
moved already. On the other hand, my exit trigger is a bit too fast
because I'm still not letting my profit run. Thus, I think I need to
automate some of my decision making process (like adding some ShowMe's)
rather than just eyeballing my indicators. One idea I'm having is tune
my fast time period with an appropriate ShowMe. This should be something
simple. I am thinking of implementing a ShowMe for local high/low with
stochastic divergence as setup.&lt;/p&gt;
