he wanted me to produce. I work with him sometimes so I don't mind
putting on a business intelligence hat occasionally to help him out. But
I mustn't forget that driving long-term values to the business is what I
am good at, so I had to say no to him. What's supposed to be a quick
chat with him ended up in a hour long discussion to show case what I'm
working on and demonstrating that I can do so much more than count
things for him. In short, if you want data, ask the business analyst; if
you want to solve problems, let's talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been said that &lt;a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2012/04/04/big-data-reference-model"&gt;Big Data
analysis is a feedback loop&lt;/a&gt;. However, I don't think having the data science team toil away at data is the message. Who's to say that analytical steps in a big data reference model can't involve feedback
from people in addition to models? For the past week, I've been
showcasing a new internal data product to various stakeholders in our
business. This one data product is now leading to a new process for our
accountant, a product for our online marketing manager, and an
innovative company-wide metric. All of this happened because we
collaborated rather than delegated tasks. Analysing data is not a
one-way process. &lt;a href="http://s.hbr.org/IIVNL0"&gt;Make it a feedback loop of math and people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="data-driven"></category><category term="organisation"></category></entry></feed>
