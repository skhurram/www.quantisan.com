hint) with a 0.25% rate hike overnight (WSJ: &lt;a href="http://on.wsj.com/afczTG"&gt;China Raises Interest
Rates&lt;/a&gt;). The US Dollar shot up, precious metals took a big hit. I
close my gold short soon after the TSX market open to collect some quick
profit. Rinse and repeat. I did mention that this trade is a short term
swing. I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-am-sorry-my-precious-bought-350-hgd-to-10-26/"&gt;bought this Horizons BetaPro Gold Bear Plus (HGD.TO)&lt;/a&gt;, a
leveraged gold short, on Friday and unloaded it this Tuesday. I fought
against my greed to hold just a little longer. But the ascending support
line on gold is too obvious to ignore (Fig. 1). Thus I closed this short
term position with this 5%+ gap up while the market is still deciding
what to do. Furthermore, I noticed the equities market are holding
rather well at the open. S&amp;amp;P500 held onto 1170 price level. Asian
markets were marginally green overnight. And even the CAC in Europe is
fighting an intraday low as the North American markets open. Thus, the
sky is not falling just yet. I figured it would take more omph to push
this market further down as we are indeed in a strong bullish move. At
the very least I am expecting some retaliation from the bulls. This
can't be this easy for the bears, can it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net profit for this trade is (\$10.84 - \$10.27) * 350 = \$199.50 -
\$9.90 commission = \$189.60 = 2% of account.&lt;/p&gt;

I am shorting my favourite asset,
gold. Spot gold was trading at 1372 at the time of my short during lunch
hour (see Fig. 1). I bought 350 shares of Horizons BetaPro Gold Bear
Plus ETF (HGD.TO) to short gold. It is just more convenient to do that
in my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/"&gt;RRSP trading account at Questrade&lt;/a&gt;. I am well aware of the
deteriorating value of a leveraged ETF (especially bearish ones). So I
don't intend to hold this for more than a few days. The reason for this
trade is simple. Today Bernanke made it clear that QE2 is on (WSJ:
&lt;a href="http://on.wsj.com/atEQ2z"&gt;Bernanke Makes Case for Further Fed Moves to Boost Economy&lt;/a&gt;).
Coincidentally, note the orchestrated weakening upward momentum across
precious metal (Fig. 1), currency (Fig. 2), and equities (Fig. 3).
Perhaps this is a matter of buy the rumour and sell the news? I am
betting that this rocket is running out of fuel. If I am wrong, I have
my stop set with a limited risk. If I am right, there's a long way down
from up here. So this trade is merely a matter of exploiting good
risk/reward. Stop is set at HGD.TO \$9.90. Anything below \$10.20 will
be a sign of caution. Maximum risk is (\$10.26 - \$9.90) * 350 = \$126
+ \$9.90 commission = \$135.90 = 1.4% of account. [caption id=""
