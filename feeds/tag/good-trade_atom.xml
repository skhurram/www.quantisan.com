It is confirmed
by EUR/USD's rise and treasury's gap down (TLT) today. I'm not going to
argue with the market. So I am ditching my short for Manulife Financial
(MFC.TO) while it is still testing its 13.00 resistance at the open.
12.60 is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level for MFC. It made a textbook
perfect bounce on it (Fig. 1). Also, it's Friday today, so I'd rather
not have the time decay eat more out of my premium by holding over the
weekend. Loss for this trade is (\$1.74 - [\$1.70][]) * 100 * 4 = \$16
- \$27.90 = -\$11.90 = -0.10%. Now that I am out of my short position,
watch the market tank without me on board. Update: MFC and the market
managed an impressive rally today. MFC closed at 13.15. I am glad that I
followed my own strategy. I guess I do make &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/"&gt;good timing once in a blue

short&lt;/a&gt; in my demo account (Fig. 1). Aside from that, I've also stocked
up some GBP/CHF shorts this week (Fig. 2). Both positions are now closed
because of my adjusted stops. These positions have single-handedly
lifted me half way out of a &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/work-harder-trade-fewer-in-a-long-and-excruciating-trading-drawdown/"&gt;deep drawdown&lt;/a&gt; in my demo account. These
trades netted me about 1.5% in my demo funds. Yes, you read that right,
a meager 1.5% gain and I'm calling these my best trades. No, it's not
like I haven't had &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/"&gt;good trades&lt;/a&gt; in terms of the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-eurjpy-135-00-500-1-pips/"&gt;money made&lt;/a&gt; or the
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/eurusd-95-pips-in-2-hours-an-example-of-swing-and-day-trade-convergence/"&gt;fastest pips&lt;/a&gt;. These shorts aren't even close from just looking at
the numbers. Heck, it would have been a lot more profitable if I shorted
Euro and Pound with a Dollar or Yen counter this week. So why? If you
read my post on &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/"&gt;measuring trading performance&lt;/a&gt;, you may recall that I
don't measure success by profit alone. It is performance &lt;em&gt;in terms of&lt;/em&gt;
amount risked that matters in trading. These shorts in EUR/CHF and
GBP/CHF are my best forex trades ever (in my 4 months of fx trading so
far) simply because I risked no more than 0.2% at any given time (most
of the time there were no explicit risk as my stops have locked in
profits) to make that 1.5%. 1.5% gained by risking maximum of 0.2% gives
a Reward/Risk ratio of 1.5/0.2 = 7.5! There were several occasions when
I had doubts to add to my position or were pondering about taking
profits to settle my worries. Despite all of that, I soldiered on,
managed my stops like they were my babies, and piled more into the
position according to &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/"&gt;my plan&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC/"&gt;trading setup&lt;/a&gt; (Fig. 1). By the time I started scaling out, I have
built my biggest (non-scalp) position. That gave me a lot of freedom in
scaling out as you can see on my exits shown in Figure 1 (red dots).
This Reward/Risk ratio is the highest I have achieved in recent memory.
I have always read about 10x or even 20x trades at the &lt;a href="http://www.smbtraining.com/blog/"&gt;SMB Capital
blog&lt;/a&gt;. Those guys can achieve this type of reward/risk ratio day in
and day out (I'm not affiliated with them). I guess that's the
difference between the pros and me. This is definitely something I am
strifing to do myself. &lt;strong&gt;Executing consistently high reward/risk
trades.&lt;/strong&gt; How I might do that? By continuing to improve on my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/"&gt;trading
skills&lt;/a&gt; and my understanding of the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/"&gt;forex markets&lt;/a&gt;. [caption id=""

But
I took profit a few pips earlier than I wanted because the bounce from
0.9025 fooled me. As you can see from Figure 1, AUD/USD is resting on
0.9000 support as I predicted. Now the million dollar question is,
should I go long in this currency pair because of the super long term
trend as I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-change-of-wind-for-australian-dollar-shorted-audusd-0-9183-and-audcad-0-9546/"&gt;discussed in my previous post&lt;/a&gt;? That brown support line in which AUD/USD is resting on now
(Fig. 1) extends all the way back to April 2008. However, there's also a
nearby support at &lt;a href="http://www.tradergav.com/2010/01/22/is-it-time-now-audusd-is-in-the-zone/"&gt;0.8945 as shown on Gav's Trading Blog&lt;/a&gt;. Since I
don't trade such a long term timeframe, I will be more conservative on
this by watching how the price reacts in the short term at this 0.9000
level. Gold also broke below 1100 but is holding above its own support
around 1080-1090 too. Both markets are finding support at current
prices. Let's see how well they last. I am flat in this pair until
things are more clear to me. On another note, this isn't exactly a
victory as I've been trying to short the Aussie for days. You would have
been better flipping a coin in comparison to my success rate lately.
I've lost more than I have gained on this move so far. In fact, I am
still on handicap mode (half position size) as I'm &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/work-harder-trade-fewer-in-a-long-and-excruciating-trading-drawdown/"&gt;still in a 3%
drawdown&lt;/a&gt; as shown in my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/"&gt;trading log&lt;/a&gt;. However, I am slowly
crawling my way out with limited risk and &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade"&gt;profitable trades&lt;/a&gt; such as
this.&lt;/p&gt;

I made 95
pips in two hours at the open with only two trades. This post is a
review of my trades that day for my future reference. To save you and
myself from reading, the two reasons for this good run are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convergence of intermediate term signals with day trading signals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignoring my bearish sentiment (Dubai news) and traded what I saw
    from the prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before moving on, let's start by setting the stage with some background
information to summarize what conditions were like that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news on November 25 after NY close of &lt;a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-and-yen-buoyed-by-safe-haven-flows-2009-11-27"&gt;Dubai World delaying their
debt repayments&lt;/a&gt; sent the dollar and yen soaring. I made &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/audjpy-short-81-3777-17-anatomy-of-my-first-400-pips-trade/"&gt;my first
400+ pips trade&lt;/a&gt; by being at the right place and time on this panic
wave. The U.S. market was closed that day but FTSE sold off more than 3%
the day after the news. So the expectation was for US to do a catch-up
sell off when it opens again on Friday 27th. Risk aversion (equities
down, yen and dollar up) was the talk of the day. Figure 1 below shows
the charts of ES futures (e-mini S&amp;amp;P500). Left is a 1-min. from midnight
of 27th to that morning's NYSE opening. Right is an hourly showing the
move overnight from 26th to 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="ES Futures
(e-mini S&amp;amp;P 500)"][&lt;img alt="ES Futures (e-mini S&amp;amp;P 500)" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-29-ES.png" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-29-ES.png"&gt;ES Futures (e-mini
S&amp;amp;P 500)&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intermediate term signal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows my intermediate term signal. EURUSD has been printing an
uptrend on the daily (not shown). Figure 2 shows that EURUSD was testing
the bottom of my channel so I should consider going long. Notice that
this is the same channel that called for the 1.5150 top on 25th. At
least it has proven itself useful once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURUSD,
3-hour"][&lt;img alt="EURUSD, 3-hour" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_3h.png" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_3h.png"&gt;EURUSD, 3-hour&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Short term signals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the short term signal, we need to go back to Figure 1 for the ES
charts. ES tanked 40 points over the holiday with very low volume. It
made it all the way to 1067 just before 3am on 27th. Then it lifted all
the way to 1080 at 9am. 1080 is the line in the sand for the bulls and
bears. So retracing all the way to that level before opening is
significant. This pre-open strength in ES was the sign of oversold for
me. This is the short-term confirmation I needed. I entered my first
position to long EURUSD @ 9:09 am to test the water. Then I watched both
EURUSD and ES closely for the next half hour. Once NYSE opened. I
noticed that the TICK was relatively mellow with readings around -250 to
-500. It's unusually good for a -20 points open drop on S&amp;amp;P 500. One
would expect at least -800 readings for a strong negative sentiment. So
after watching EURUSD, ES, and TICK for about 10 minutes, I entered a
second position on a weak retracement at 9:39 am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The exits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my exit, I took profit at 1.5180 because it's the 50% Fibonacci
level and it's also the top of another of my channel (Figures 2 and 3).
After about 10 minutes of watching the 1M bars, EURUSD failed to clear
that resistance, so I took profit on the second half to go flat in this
pair just before 11 am because it's an early-closing Friday (NYSE
closing at 1pm). The gains were +95 and +93 pips for +0.27% and +0.28%
in my demo account total. Not bad for holding for 2 hours. Update:
Thanks to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jlcnuke"&gt;Jeff on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for the question. I updated Figure 3 with
the Fib. levels and showed the top and bottom used to draw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURUSD, 30
min."][&lt;img alt="EURUSD, 30 min." src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_30min.png" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_30min.png"&gt;EURUSD, 30 min.&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I started with an intermediate term setup that aligns with
the major trend. I observed the reaction of the markets on an important
news. Identified an oversold condition from the short-term charts for a
short-term positive divergence signal. Scaled in a position. Then added
more with another confirmation. I scaled out when the target was hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommendation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I could have been more aggressive on this trade. As shown in
Figure 3, 1.4920-4930 was a short-term resistance. I could have added
more to my position when that level broke, with a stop at 1.4900.&lt;/p&gt;

Still, I feel very lucky. In
this post, I will review why I entered this position, why I added to it,
and why I exited. The goal is for myself to learn from what works and
what can I do to improve on this trade given some hindsight advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Signal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See Figure 1 on the daily chart of AUDJPY (first entry price pointed
with blue arrow). Notice the lower highs, with the 2nd high inside my
fChannel and the 3rd (last, just before entry) high below a yet longer
term fChannel. Plus 1 point for the lower highs and another 1 point for
the highs moving into the channels. Two points here. [caption id=""

&lt;h3&gt;The Choice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both AUDJPY and AUDUSD seemed promising. I focused on AUDJPY
because the Yen seemed better poised for strength. I discussed my
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-use-fx-futures-to-narrow-down-which-forex-pair-to-trade/"&gt;method of choosing a better counter currency for trading&lt;/a&gt; in another
post, so I won't discuss it here. However, as this trade became more and
more obvious and into the green, I diversified my short by adding shorts
in NZDJPY and NZDUSD. Those two netted around +100 and +250 pips also.
Another plus 1 point for picking and choosing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Confirmation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really gave me confidence in this trade is the price action in gold
in comparison to the Aussie. Figure 2 shows the Gold Futures price (/GC,
lower left) and Australian dollar futures (/6A, middle left). Notice
that gold has been trending up steadily for days but the Aussie made a
lower low. That's a negative divergence. Plus 1 point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="4-hour charts of
forex markets, gold, and crude oil"][&lt;img alt="4-hour charts of 6 major
currencies, gold, and crude oil" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-26-ForexOverview_4h.png" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-26-ForexOverview_4h.png"&gt;4-hour charts of 6 major currencies,
gold, and crude oil&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Timing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For timing this trade, I observed the intraday movement of AUDJPY,
EURUSD, and other related pairs. The most obvious sign of Aussie
weakness was from comparing the price action of EURUSD and AUDJPY. The
3-hour charts of EURUSD and AUDJPY are shown in Figures 3 and 4,
respectively. Notice on Nov 24 and 25, EURUSD trended higher and made a
new high. At the same time, AUDJPY barely moved on the 24th and squeezed
even more on 25th. The difference was even more noticeable when I was
watching the 30-min at the time. I had thought that my datafeed was
lagging when AUDJPY barely moved yet EURUSD was rocketing up. Plus 1
point for the 3-hour price action and then another 1 point for the
30-minute price action (not shown).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURUSD,

&lt;h3&gt;The Entries and Exits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six points total for the trade, time to establish a position. You can
see my orders in Figure 4 above. My first entry was Nov 25 15:12 at
81.37 with a half position. It is marked by a yellow triangle at the
cliff beforethe dive (how lucky). I added another half that evening
23:06 at 79.94. I was waiting for a 50% retracement to 80.50 to add but
that didn't seem to be happening. So I added 1/2 when AUDJPY failed to
break 80.0 with a strategy to add another at 80.50. But 80.50 never
happened and it took another dive. My exits are determined at the time
as usual by using stops. I simply keep moving the stop along and
narrowing them once we break support level. After the move became
vertical, I zoomed out to the daily chart to view potential targets. The
77.0 and 76.00 levels (as shown in Figure 1) became my not-be-greedy
targets. I had my stops really tight at those point and even had a take
profit set for half the position at 76.0, but that level wasn't tested
before I got stopped out. The two red dots at 77.17 and 77.08 are my
stopped exits as shown in Figure 4's last bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made this lucky trade happen is that I had spent a lot of time
analyzing it from different perspectives and watching the intraday price
actions for days. I also took my time to scale in and out to minimize my
risk. To make this a habit, I will use this point counting system from
now on to help me analyze more and trade less. One thing that I'd like
to improve upon is to be more aggressive on a winning position. How?
That will be saved for another post when I figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Define a long term time frame for identifying setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw the major supports and resistances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a momentum technical indicator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a trend indicator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An entry is signaled by an agreement of the trend and the indicator
    at the support or resistance price level. Do not enter yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a short term time frame for timing, use this for the
    following steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw the supports and resistances on this short time frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place an order when the price breaks the short-term trend to be
    aligned with the trend on the longer one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exit when the entry conditions are gone (not necessarily reversed).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very vague. So here's a real example in practice. Figure 1 shows
steps 1 to 5 on the daily chart of CAD/JPY for a short entry. The entry
point is the bar before the marked vertical line on Oct 21. See that
CAD/JPY tested the descending resistance line (step #2) with a negative
RSI divergence (#3). The trend as suggested by the moving averages is a
choppy downtrend (#4). Thus, the conditions were met and a short entry
is signaled. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"

entry, Figure 2 is a 3-hour chart of CAD/JPY with the entries and exits
marked. Yellow triangles are entries and red dots are exits. I entered a
full position after CAD/JPY made the initial dive and then retraced to
the previous support (now resistance) line. It bounced right off that
line strongly (left side of figure). I entered at market price once we
made a hammer candlestick (negative signal) the bar before. Stop was
placed at 88.0, near the recent high and at a round number resistance.

I had a manually adjusted hard stop to be a couple of resistances away.
I kept it loose on purpose because this position was my biggest winner.
(Let your profits run). But once the RSI on the daily passed below 50, I
took a more conservative approach on the exit stop. Then once CAD/JPY
tested 84.50 and hung around 85.0, I tightened my stop and was taken out
at 85.30. Note that my original target was 84.0, so I thought testing
84.50 was close enough. Also note that this setup is expected to be
executed recursively. It is meant to be run so that you're &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/"&gt;stacking up
your winning position&lt;/a&gt; if the conditions and the trend is in your
favour. This is actually where the power with this setup kicks in. I'll
continue with the CAD/JPY example to illustrate this point. Notice in
Figure 2 that I added to this CAD/JPY short at the (second from the
right) yellow triangle point on the chart at 86.3 for 50% more units.
The down move was still intact as shown in Figure 1 at the time. Using
the same setup, I added more units to this position. And by adding 50%
more to my position, I was able to ride that last wave down for +200
pips on these extra units. Otherwise, I would have exited at 85.30 on
the consolidation around 85.0 and left with nothing on the market for
the last big wave. The timing as shown in Figure 2 for this addition
isn't the same as for the original entry. But it's obvious enough on the
figure with the same markings which I used. Simply refer to Figure 2 for
a visual explanation on the timing for this entry. In case you haven't
noticed on Figure 2, but I just re-entered this position with half the
size using the same setup. Since this third entry is still in progress,
I can't comment on it just yet. We'll see how it goes. Finally, for ease
of referencing this trading setup later on, I will call this particular
setup, FTC (forex trend-continuation). Right now it's version 0.1, a
first publication release but still in beta testing with my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/"&gt;paper
trading&lt;/a&gt;. Once the setup has proven itself, I will use it in live
trading with real money. Then I will christen it with a version 1.0, and
perhaps a better name. In the mean time, I expect more refinement to
this setup as I continue to try it out on paper trading. Check my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC"&gt;FTC
tag&lt;/a&gt; for more sample applications of this trading signal. Update Nov
18, 2009: I've changed the name from FTCS to FTC as I now have a &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTR"&gt;FTR&lt;/a&gt;
setup.&lt;/p&gt;

loaded to ride the trend. One of the earliest trade I made in this wave
is going long on USD/CHF. Figure 1 is taken today after a full week
since the initial move in USD. The vertical line marks the day when I
entered this trade on Thursday 22nd late afternoon. Here are my reasons
for making the entry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parity level 1.0000 was a mere 30 pips away from the low the day
    before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obvious positive divergence on the indicator, Fig. 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breakout on the shorter 3-hour timeframe, Fig. 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I placed the order just above the resistance and beyond the short term
channel. The order was filled the next day in the morning on the 23rd.
In hindsight, I should have used a half position only and added to it
once it broke the longer term descending resistance as shown in Fig. 2.
That's because a short term break is a low probability move given that
the downtrend was strong. However, USD/CHF was testing parity, which is
as strong a support as you can find for many reasons. As you can see
from Fig. 2, the entry was rather good overall (could have been better
as discussed above). However, I think the exit was also a disciplined
move. My original target was 1.026 as noted below. It was just below
that horizontal resistance at 1.0267 which I marked on Fig. 1. Yet,
there's also the longer term trendline marked on both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.
I had 4-5 positions open at the time and this was one of my strongest
two (the other being CAD/JPY short), so I tried to add to my position
once the pair broke that longer term trendline. However, the line proved
to be strong as USD/CHF retraced and took out my stop as shown in Fig. 2
(red dot, 2nd from right). Nevertheless, the pair remained above 1.0200
and my core position was safe (I moved my stop up). But not all was
well. USD/CHF eventually broke 1.025 but it didn't go far. It printed a
couple more bars on the chart while I kept moving my stop closer and
closer. Also noting that the pair was short-term overbought, I moved my
stop right up to below 1.025 at 1.0245 to lock in most of the profit.
That stop was eventually taken out and the pair took a dive as shown in
Fig. 2. Moving the stop up tight in a short-term overbought condition
was a good choice. I learned this from my recent trades when I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdcad-all-out-1-0872-196-6-pips-and-1-0821-145-6-pips/"&gt;left
profits on the table&lt;/a&gt;. So I got out against my hope for higher pips
even when the talk of USD making a return to strength was ubiquitous. I
traded what I saw and not what I hoped for, and against the opinions of
other people. If only my entry was a bit more patient, this would have
been one of my best executed trades. Below are the data for my entries.
Position size: 100% First Entry: 1.009 First Stop: 1.0030 First Target:
1.0260 Reward / Risk #1 = 170 / 60 = 2.8 \&amp;lt; 3, but close enough. Second
Position Size: 25% Second entry/stop: 1.0232/1.0220 I didn't have a
target in mind for this addition because it was only to add on the
strength of the existing position.&lt;/p&gt;

stop. Notice from Figure 1 that EUR/JPY is now in overbought territory.
In addition, a negative divergence is developing on the RSI from the
recent 2 peaks also at 135.00. The best thing about this trade was &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-eurjpy-long-100-129-99-stop-128-80/"&gt;my
entry&lt;/a&gt;. However, I certainly didn't chop this setup the best I could.
Even though I rode this up for +500 pips, I only had a 50% position
size. There were two easily identifiable adding points which I could
have taken advantage of. When EUR/JPY broke above 132.00, which was a
clear short-term resistance, a day after my entry I should have added to
my position then because of short-term momentum. Another chance came at
132.50 or so. As shown in Figure 2, when the price retested the low end
of the channel at 132.50. Both of these opportunities would have
survived with my usual stop of 100 pips. Another disappointment was that
my second half of the position was stopped out shortly because I moved
my stop up too soon. I was confident enough when I placed the order to
enter a full position size. But my over-zealous need to reduce risk got
the better of me. I observed on a daily time frame but traded in the
3-hour. To be more accurate in pointing the finger, it was my lack of
patience that stopped out my other half of the position. Anyway, I did
rode the wave with a sufficient position size. One thing I just noticed
is the T formation in Figure 2. EUR/JPY is back to where it started a
month ago. Where it heads now is uncertain. I will keep an eye on this
pair and aim to re-enter another long in a few days. The trend is your
friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally! I have been waiting for a bear market rally for weeks! I
decided to go &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/"&gt;full long after the bounce from 820 today&lt;/a&gt;. Refer to
that post for &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/"&gt;details of my entries&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I would like to discuss why the 820 bounce
gave me the confidence in going all in despite widespread fear and the
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/covered-slw-fro-and-wfc-short-puts/"&gt;many failed attempts&lt;/a&gt; myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick recap of the past week's action. After the failed rally attempt
from 10/28 to 11/04, the market has been brutal to say the least. Any
strength failed to stir enthusiasm and has bled down slowly. The market
drifted down lower on little volume day after day. If I were to describe
the market, I'd say it looked like the last moment of a dying man. This
lack of will to move has certainly killed many bulls. I was one of them.
I have been stopped out a few times trying to catch this falling knife
(more like a grind). I even prepared to exit the last of my holdings if
we do break down from this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of the day, the market looked like it's going to be
another down drift today. But being very near the 10/10 bottom already,
I know things are going to move one way or the other before the options
expiry next week. And since the Max Pain for the index options are at
least 10% higher, I am still looking for a reversal soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentally noted S&amp;amp;P at 845 is an important level. It was the low of the
10/28 big rally day. The market skid on the 845 level all morning with
little volume. That was good because it is testing a support on low
volume. I had thought we may bounce from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went to lunch just before noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back after 1pm, the market has already broken down. However,
there are several bullish indication I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the break down volume is higher than the previous bar (Figure 1),
    but it's still relatively low. Which means we don't have panic
    selling yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;both the TICK and Advance-Decline line moving averages (Figure 2)
    are relatively healthy for such an important drop. Indicating no
    broad selling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notice the unusual V shape for the TICK (Figure 2)? We even reached
    a new multi-day low of -1666. Yet #1 and #2 contradicts this
    seemingly panic selling, so this depression in price looked
    artificial to me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like how the recent rally attempts lacked enthusiasm, this break of 845
and test of 820 looked like it lacked enthusiasm too. Given that this is
such a major support level, odds are that we will bounce from here at
least for intraday. That is when I made my entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Before 2pm, we broke 850, the low of yesterday, with the highest 30 min
volume of the week. That is when the rally looked strong to me and my
doubt of a bull trap eased. Frankly, I had some tight mental stops and
prepared to jump if things deteriorate like the many times before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day continued strong with price and volume confirmation. We closed
at the high with significant volume. We even reached 700 million volume
on SPY, a first since 10/16. I believe an intermediate bottom has been
set so I'll be looking at a longer timeframe (days) for my long
positions now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First expected resistance from this move is 980 on the S&amp;amp;P from the
trendline (Figure 1, right). Target is at least the 50 dma, we just
haven't touched it for 2 months. This is as good a time as ever to give
it a run for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is a great example of the need for critical thinking with a clear
head in light of a lot of pressure and past emotion. The beaten account,
the grim market movement, and the many stopped out trades has nearly
made me walk away for the week. But I remained focus on the market and
made my decision based on the price action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite renewed optimism, I will continue to practice &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/"&gt;prudent risk
management&lt;/a&gt; and to eventually pocket at least most of the profit from
today, if not more.&lt;/p&gt;
