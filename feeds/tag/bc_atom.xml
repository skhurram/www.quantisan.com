(BC) stayed above \$11.00 as we began the week. I placed
a stop at Friday's high before the open today to be executed at 10:30am.
When I got back at lunch, I found that my stop was triggered as soon as
it was sent. Luckily, it was also at the time when BC retraced the
open's gain slightly. So it was a good price to be out since BC has
closed above \$12 today (Figure 1). This trade was &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-bc-100-oct-09-12-5-put-1-95-mark-10-81/"&gt;entered last Friday
before noon at 1.95&lt;/a&gt;, when BC was trading at 10.81. This represents a
loss of \$65. For this particular trade, I adhered to my exit strategy
(even though it was a loss), so that's good. For the entry, I could have
waited later on in the day on Friday to see how the market performs as
we approached the end of the week. If I had done that, the reward/risk
would have been better. But I think I would have entered short anyway
since the sign were pointing downward when BC hung back to around \$11
at the close after breaking above \$11.20 intraday on good volume. And
the fact hat the market was consolidating too. Looking at the long term,
BC has retraced all its loss since the dive last year. For the market,
S&amp;amp;P500 has etched higher today too but is still about 10 points below
last week's all-year high. The volume for the overall market is
noticeably lighter too. So this uptrend can possibly continue up as not
many is riding this move. We shall see how this goes. As can be seen
from Figure 2, BC at \$12 has some resistance above to \$13. For the
lower end of the range, we have \$9.60. A break below \$9.60 would
signal a stop of this recent bull train's momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

50 cents this morning on an analyst upgrade. It subsequently tested
\$11.00 with about 5 times first 30-minute volume. It has since been in
a trading range. Why is this significant? Observing Figure 1, we can see
that \$10.85 is the 62% Fibonacci level of the entire drop from Sept 19,
2008. Practically exactly a year ago. Secondly, this huge volume at open
is good as it typically signal retail/pubic euphoria. Combining the two,
huge volume retail push + test a long term resistance = shorting
opportunity! In the near term, BC is also testing a resitance as shown
in Figure 2. Finally the stars may be aligned for a short in BC. I have
tried many times and failed miserably in the past several weeks. But
after analysing my trades and re-evaluating my method, this setup offers
a very good chance. So let's see how it goes. Entry: \$10.81 Stop:
\$11.00 by end of next week. Target: \$9.00, the next Fibonacci level.
Reward / Risk = \$155 / \$45 = 3.4. (These values are obtained by
estimating the premium of this option at expiry using the
Bjerksund-Stensland approximation.)&lt;/p&gt;

short, here are some mistakes I made with this trade, in decreasing
order of significance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shorting when the trend is obviously up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not adhering to my stop.&lt;/li&gt;

The pre
and post FOMC action today merely produced a few points of move on the
S&amp;amp;P500. However, with the S&amp;amp;P500 making a marginally new high, the high
risk sectors (i.e. financial XLF and real estate IYR) are still off
their highs by much. Furthermore, the junk bonds (JNK) is failing to
lift too. This is a good sign that the junk of the market aren't being
bidded for. This is definitely a negative divergence. However, things
aren't always that easy. From that lack of participation either way,
we'll likely move within a range for a while. So &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-cof-100-aug-09-33-put-2-20-mark-32-10/"&gt;my COF short&lt;/a&gt; is in
threat of expiring. The move for me now is to unload both COF and &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-pg-100-aug-09-52-5-call-60-mark-52-16/"&gt;my
hedge in PG long&lt;/a&gt; before expiration next week. I bought Brunswick Corp
(BC) for September's expiration because some meaningful move is likely,
particularly considering the scenario BC is in now. Looking at Figure 2,
BC has tested a solid long term resistance about \$10. It has tanked
more than 4% today while the market is up about 1% and marked a new
intraday high. And in case you haven't noticed, BC has been going
through wild cycles of ups and downs. Those patterns are looking darn
nice if this is indeed the top for BC. We can expect BC to be breaking
below \$6 if history plays itself out once again. Furthermore, the
intraday push to resistance at 9.25 has failed miserably in the late day
(Figure 3). That was when I decided to enter this position. Entry:
\$9.12 Stop: \$9.70 Target: \$6.00 Reward / Risk = 3.12 / 0.58 = 5.4 &gt;
5 Note: Because these are farther out options, my risk is definitely
higher than this simple calculation depicts because of the time decay. I
will need to figure out a simple way of better assessing my risk other
than using Black-Scholes manually. P.S.: Forget to mention that I picked
up this tip for BC from &lt;a href="http://caracommunity.com/content/caras-commentary-community-chat-wednesday-aug-12-2009#comment-41326"&gt;Cara Community&lt;/a&gt;. [caption
