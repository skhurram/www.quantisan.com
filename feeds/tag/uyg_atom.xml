&lt;p&gt;I sold my 100 shares of UYG because it was &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/"&gt;bought on margin last
Friday&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/"&gt;call option was exercised&lt;/a&gt;. The effective share
price I bought was \$3.55. I sold it for \$4.49 today. A profit of \$94
- (\$7.5[option fee]+\$15[exercise fee]+\$5[stock fee]) commission.
Clearly, the commission made this trade a bad one. I didn't know TOS
charge me \$15 for exercising options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sold at \$4.50 because it's a resistance level and we tested it a
couple times this morning without breaking it. Although the risk/reward
at \$4.50 still remains favourable, I sold because I don't want to use
margin money. As of this writing, UYG has broken \$4.50 to \$4.67. I
believe \$5.00 is a good target and possible \$5.7 in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I still have my trump card in the financials. My &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/"&gt;C options
strangle&lt;/a&gt; is doing quite well now that the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122753629931853007.html"&gt;government is pumping
money into Citigroup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: After writing a &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/"&gt;big piece on trailing stop&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, I totally forgot to apply it myself. I really
should have used a trailing stop in this case since I thought \$4.40 was
a good stop. UYG is now trading at \$4.85 without much drawdown. At
least this is a small position.&lt;/p&gt;

Every time I think we're at a bottom, the market rally a bit to get my
hopes up and then continue to drift down more. In retrospect, there are
so many trading no-no's I have broken with that dangerous mentality. My
account is down significantly as of this writing and I have learned many
old and new lessons throughout these weeks. In fact, I have demonstrated
improving trading &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/"&gt;technique&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1190/"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt; even as I was losing
money overall (what an oxymoron). Rather I'm trying to comfort myself or
not, the fact is that losing money is simply unacceptable in trading. So
I will review these trades in this post and perhaps learn something from
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title suggest, this is a post for post-hoc analysis of the
options which I held into expiry (3 losing and 1 winning). I'll do this
chronologically. The longest Nov09 position I have is SLW Nov 2.5 Call.
I have been a big fan of SLW as I've &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/"&gt;written and traded SLW numerous
times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, I've annoted my charts
more than usual and will show more and write less in this post. I noted
my entry point in each trade, and labelled the stop and post-hoc &lt;strong&gt;ideal
exit/stop points&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My effective &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/"&gt;entry point in my SLW Nov 2.5 Calls&lt;/a&gt; were at SLW share
price of \$2.90 (SLW closed at \$2.81 Friday). I bought 2 Calls for
\$0.55 and at expiry, they are worth \$0.325. A loss of \$45 + \$15 for
commission as of this writing. I held on to my 2.5 calls and exercised
them, so +200 shares of SLW for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is ABB on the same day. The share price for ABB was at \$10.31
when I entered. ABB closed Friday at \$9.95. I bougt the three ABB Nov
10 Calls for \$0.90. They are worth \$0.05 each. A total loss of \$255 +
\$15 for commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_858" align="aligncenter" width="500"

&lt;p&gt;Then we have TCK entered at TCK share price of \$5.575. I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-tck-100-nov-08-5-call-100/"&gt;bought two
TCK Nov 5 Calls for \$1.00&lt;/a&gt; each and they are now worthless. A
complete wipeout of \$200 + \$15 commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there's this puny winning day trade in the last 40 minute of
Friday. I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/"&gt;bought a UYG Nov 3 Call for \$0.55&lt;/a&gt; and it expired for
\$0.95. A profit of \$40 - \$15 comission, so a total of +\$25 so far. I
held on to this call and exercised it. I have +100 shares of UYG to
carry over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="attachment_868" align="aligncenter" width="500"

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, &lt;strong&gt;if only I have used trailing stops, I could have held
onto some of the profits and not turn winning trades into a losing
ones&lt;/strong&gt;. I didn't want to let the large swing in premiums stop me out
from a big rally. That's why I didn't use trailing stop. However, the
lack of subsequent follow-through and confirmation in the rally should
have been a glaring alarm sign. I should have put in trailing stops from
this lack of strength in the rally. &lt;strong&gt;Any counter-trend position should
be carefully managed with tighter than usual risk management&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have let my &lt;em&gt;undying hope for a rally&lt;/em&gt; clouded my judgement. This
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/move-from-certainty-to-curiosity-to-improve-your-trading/"&gt;stubborn need to be right&lt;/a&gt; is a very fundamental psychological flaw
in trading. If I can't stop doing that in the future, I might as well
quit trading manually and focus on developing my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/"&gt;quantitative financial
engineering&lt;/a&gt; work. However, as I have noted, I think I'm improving
lately and upon further reflection, I believe I have come up with a
potential methodology to correct myself in the act ... More on this as I
develop on this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a cheap shot in the final 45 minutes of this option expiration
Friday. S&amp;amp;P has shot up to 775 and retraced a little. The
Advance-Decline line has turned up and the TICK is strong during this
retracement. This looks like a strong setup to rally into the close.
Let's see if the market can do it. Otherwise, there goes \$62.50 into
the drain.&lt;/p&gt;
