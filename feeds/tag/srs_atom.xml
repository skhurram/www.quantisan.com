deep-underwater SRS position. I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-31-srs-4808/"&gt;bought these shares back in April&lt;/a&gt;
for \$48.08 as SRS is testing a long term support. The next day, &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/srs-is-testing-a-long-term-support-still-holding-on-barely/"&gt;SRS
tanked over 17%&lt;/a&gt;! Having been delusional to myself, &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/review-of-positions-srs-and-uso/"&gt;I held on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a failed trade right from the start. The biggest mistake is not
setting a stop even though the price is sitting on a long term support.
A support is only a support until it fails. And when a long term support
fails, it usually does so spectacularly. A better trade should have been
to establish a short instead when it breaks below the support, well,
obvious to everyone now in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total loss from this position is about \$800 on a \$1500 principle.
Horrible, and not just number-wise, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

\$24.36. I took the opportunity to exit because \$24.50 is a major
resistance (Figure 1) and at the same time, S&amp;amp;P500 touched 885, which is
a major support (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My total &lt;strong&gt;loss&lt;/strong&gt; for this trade is -(\$6.10 - \$11.00) * 100 + \$15
commission = \$505... For what I thought would be a small play, this
amount of loss is totally unacceptable. There are a couple of lessons
here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always put a number to the risk you're willing to take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always adhere to stop levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never enter a trade "in a rush" like I have done for &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-srs-100-may-09-35-put-610/"&gt;this entry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultrashort ETF's are mathematically a losing game. Never go long in
    these again. However, they'll be great candidates to short.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've formalized my first 3 lessons into &lt;a href="../3-rules/"&gt;my 3 Rules to be followed
religiously&lt;/a&gt;. And I have also gone back to the &lt;a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tag/paper%20trade/"&gt;drawing board to work
on my trading strategy&lt;/a&gt;. I must remember how much pain this trade has
caused and my determination to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Now, I still have 31 shares of SRS to unload after this...&lt;/p&gt;

In particular, 890-900 seem like a
vital pivot point from intraday action. Since SRS popped 10.45% today
already, I have done something which I should have done when I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-srs-100-may-09-35-put-610/"&gt;wrote
this put for SRS for \$6.10 in April 9th&lt;/a&gt;. That is, adding a stop. My
stop to buy back this put is set at \$11.90, or effectively about \$23.3
for the underlying SRS shares. The closest intraday support as of this
moment is \$23.40 for SRS shares, just when S&amp;amp;P500 retraced back to 895
or so. But SRS quickly regained footing to \$23.70+ (another pivot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am putting a loose stop for now because there seems to be more
momentum for this market decline from the intraday sentiment. I'll
update my stop as we approach the close today. Since this option expires
Friday, I need to get rid of it one way or another before it does.&lt;/p&gt;

To add to the mistake, I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-srs-100-may-09-35-put-610/"&gt;added
to it last Thursday in a hurry&lt;/a&gt; hoping for a rebound from a massive
selloff to a new 52-week low. Even though the chart looked like it was
testing support last Thursday, I &lt;strong&gt;should have waited for a rebound
before entering&lt;/strong&gt;. And second, &lt;strong&gt;if I don't even have the time to write
my trade log, I should never enter a trade&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a wakeup call to rectify my tendency of entering too
early in the short term. I have since mentally walked through what I
should have done and have come up with a simple entry strategy that I
will follow from now on. Basically, I will wait validation of a intraday
low and then enter only if it passes its intraday resistance. Then I
will set a hard stop just below a recent support. This will no doubt
create a lot more stopped out trades, but it's up to me to find high
probability trades. All it needs now is some verification...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I clearly need to spend less time trading and more time
developing my skills and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the positions at hand. From Figure 1, SRS is at the bottom of a
long term down trend. Stop is \$30. Target is \$41. From the look of it,
SRS will be going down even further if the market can hold its ground
above 850. However, if the market fails to climb up, then yesterday's
slightly higher low than Monday is a small plus point for SRS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: Interestingly, in today's news &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123979197193420547.html"&gt;U.S. Foreclosures Jumped in
March&lt;/a&gt; and General Growth Files For Bankruptcy: Report. The 2nd news
came in the middle of the night. And it's nowhere to be found unless you
really look for it. I only read about it from &lt;a href="http://caracommunity.com/content/caras-commentary-community-chat-thurs-apr-16-2009"&gt;CaraCommunity&lt;/a&gt;. For one
of the largest REIT to declare bankruptcy, you'd think it'd be all over
the news. Doesn't take a genious to figure this incident is deliberately
hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My USO position is faring better, although it's merely hovering above
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-175/"&gt;my entry price&lt;/a&gt;. Now that the &lt;a href="http://shockedinvestor.blogspot.com/2009/04/uso-rollover-report-for-april.html"&gt;April roll over of USO&lt;/a&gt; is complete,
the downward pressure on USO should be gone. Even during the roll over,
USO has managed to remain above its upward trendline. This is definitely
a big plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New stop is \$28.80 and conservative target is \$32.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm down
\$10/share at the close today. However, we are just testing a long term
support line here. Furthermore, the market is only up about 1% today
whereas SRS tanked 17.58%. This is definitely capitulation of SRS we're
seeing now. The question I ask myself is, would I be buying at this
level? Given the above two reasons, the answer is yes. Yet, I would
definitely ditch it early next week if there's continued weakness for
SRS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest mistake for this trade is entering too early. Note to self,
&lt;strong&gt;wait for a bounce from support before entering and set a hard stop
just below it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Volume is light
today. In addition, &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/"&gt;my short, GE&lt;/a&gt;, is still below its \$11
resistance. And the finanacials isn't moving much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target: \$85, around the 200d MA and my trendline as shown, Figure 1
right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop: around \$45 - \$46. Or S&amp;amp;P 500 staying above 850.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: This rally in the market looks a bit over stretched based
on the indicators. We've been going up and up since the beginning of
March. I still believe we're in a long term downtrend. That's why I'm
shorting this &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-is-looking-ready-to-continue-its-bear-rally/"&gt;counter-trend rally&lt;/a&gt;. And today looks like a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: I seem to have a thing for picking my stops. SRS just glazed
below \$45 and then bounced back to above \$46. My stops typically mark
the turning point. In other words, I'm usually in too early. So if I
just set my entry price to my stops instead and let the price come to
me, then that might be a better entry for me. Better yet, &lt;strong&gt;before
entering a position, wait for the stock to hit my mental stops and watch
how it performs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
