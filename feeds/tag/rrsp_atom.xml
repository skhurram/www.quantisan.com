yesterday so I had to reassess the position. I sold my shares at \$0.56
for a loss of (\$0.56 - \$0.62) * 1000 = \$70 + \$19.90 commission =
\$89.90 = 0.9% of account. Gold is falling while USD tanked this week.
The lack of volume on today's goldminers rally is also uncharacteristic
of the recent uptrend. The long term uptrend of gold and gold miners is
unmistakable on both fundamental and technical basis. I am taking a
dabble in this junior gold miner as its share price is making a gap fill
on a recent breakout (Fig. 1), amongst other things. Intraday chart
(Fig. 2) is also showing signs of life at this support level. What's
going to happen to gold as it breaks below 1350 (first time since
November) from worries about Chinese inflation, which led to strength in
USD (on fear of further Chinese tightening) as EURUSD dropped 60 pips in
2 hours. See FT: &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ab89d906-244e-11e0-a89a-00144feab49a.html"&gt;Fears grow that China is overheating&lt;/a&gt;. Couple that
with political and economic uncertainty, we have a short term
uncertainty in gold's direction. However, all these is in line with the
underlying gold-bug case that money is becoming more worthless as
governments pump in money to their respective economies. Another point
to note is that as the Shanghai Composite and Bombay Stock Exchange
(i.e. growth markets) are making 3-month lows in recent weeks, people
will start to look for other assets to diversify their wealth. This is
all conjectures anyway. I can't predict the future.I am merely placing
my bet as the stars seem to have aligned for me to increase the
probability of this good reward/risk trade. Mental stop is \$0.55. Hard
stop is \$0.48, however, I'll give it some margin and say 0.40 is my
stop as liquidity is thin in this junior. Thus, risk is (\$0.62 -
\$0.40) * 1000 = \$220 + \$9.95 commission = \$229.95 = 2.4% of
account. Note: You might have noticed that my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/"&gt;trade log&lt;/a&gt; style has
changed for 2011. I am trying to jot down my thought process rather than
the data analysis and numerical logic to better capture my &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;
for the record.&lt;/p&gt;

Holding
time was just a day. I would have liked to hold this position for longer
but the market is directionless. In addition, the stop hunt on the
shorts in LLL.TO is unmistakable as seen in Figure 1. Option expiration
is this Friday. So I'm taking my profit now prior to expected
volatility. A reward/risk of 2 to 1 is too tempting to let go. However,
LLL.TO is pushing higher into the close. So perhaps this is yet another
lack of patience on my part. Update Nov 18: Yes, I was too early indeed.
LLL.TO gapped upward the day after my exit. Option pain is pegged at
\$45 on the American shares (NASDAQ:LULU). LULU is trading just above

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I'm picking a growth stock, Lululemon (LLL.TO). Lululemon is
holding well in this down move. Furthermore, the intraday test of
support at 46.50 looks promising as there were few sellers at that price
level. The recent break above long-term resistance at 48 is good too. So
is the 19.6% short float... Anyway, you get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

today. EURUSD looks to be trading in a range. And since FOMC and G20 are
right around the corner, I am not expecting the market to do anything
drastic (i.e. breakout). So I am shorting commodity (to long US dollar)
as EUR/USD is at the top of its channel (Fig. 1). I picked Horizons
BetaPro Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) because it's one of the most active
reverse ETF on the TSX. I considered buying HFD.TO (for shorting
financials) but that one has a fraction of the volume of HOD.TO. The
falling star candle right below the 82.50 resistance on the hourly chart
of crude oil (Fig. 2) is also a factor in my timing. Risk is (\$9.19 -

It got stopped out
2 minutes before the close for a small profit. Following the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-350-hgd-to-10-84-profit-2/"&gt;covering
of my short side play this morning&lt;/a&gt;, I sneaked back in to the gold bug
camp. In particular, I bought some of my recent favourite gold miner,
Ventana Gold Corp. (VEN.TO), a few minutes before the close. Gold held
on to the 1330 support as I've discussed this morning (see &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-350-hgd-to-10-84-profit-2/"&gt;gold chart
in this morning's post&lt;/a&gt;). I
also watched the closing 30 minutes of the market and VEN.TO respected
its 8.90 support level too. See Figure 1. There was a brief touch below
8.90 but it pushed back up quickly (not shown). This is a play inline
with the direction of the recent rally. Just riding the trend. Nothing
fancy. Hard stop is \$8.80. Mental stop is \$8.88. Maximum risk is
(\$8.95 - \$8.80) * 300 = \$45 + \$9.90 commission = \$54.90 = 0.5% of
account. There's a risk of another gap down open tomorrow. So my
position is small in case the market runs away overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

against my greed to hold just a little longer. But the ascending support
line on gold is too obvious to ignore (Fig. 1). Thus I closed this short
term position with this 5%+ gap up while the market is still deciding
what to do. Furthermore, I noticed the equities market are holding
rather well at the open. S&amp;amp;P500 held onto 1170 price level. Asian
markets were marginally green overnight. And even the CAC in Europe is
fighting an intraday low as the North American markets open. Thus, the

gold. Spot gold was trading at 1372 at the time of my short during lunch
hour (see Fig. 1). I bought 350 shares of Horizons BetaPro Gold Bear
Plus ETF (HGD.TO) to short gold. It is just more convenient to do that
in my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/"&gt;RRSP trading account at Questrade&lt;/a&gt;. I am well aware of the
deteriorating value of a leveraged ETF (especially bearish ones). So I
don't intend to hold this for more than a few days. The reason for this
trade is simple. Today Bernanke made it clear that QE2 is on (WSJ:
&lt;a href="http://on.wsj.com/atEQ2z"&gt;Bernanke Makes Case for Further Fed Moves to Boost Economy&lt;/a&gt;).
Coincidentally, note the orchestrated weakening upward momentum across
precious metal (Fig. 1), currency (Fig. 2), and equities (Fig. 3).
Perhaps this is a matter of buy the rumour and sell the news? I am
betting that this rocket is running out of fuel. If I am wrong, I have
my stop set with a limited risk. If I am right, there's a long way down
from up here. So this trade is merely a matter of exploiting good
risk/reward. Stop is set at HGD.TO \$9.90. Anything below \$10.20 will
be a sign of caution. Maximum risk is (\$10.26 - \$9.90) * 350 = \$126

steam despite gold prices hitting record high seemingly on a daily
