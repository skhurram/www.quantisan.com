EUR/USD is bouncing off a long term support around 1.3600. Thus I'm
covering my short in Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) before the weekend.
&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/story-of-a-bad-trade-and-a-missed-opportunity/"&gt;This position turned out horribly&lt;/a&gt;. I've been waiting for MFC.TO to
print 14.50, just above its 38.6% Fibonacci retracement level at 14.40
on the recent spike. But 14.80 doesn't seem to budge even today with all
that bearishness floating around. Intraday volume is also decreasing on
every new test of this intraday support. So I'm throwing in the towel
here. Loss is (\$0.45 - \$0.93) * 4 * 100 = -\$192 - \$27.90 =
-\$219.90 = -2.3% of account.&lt;/p&gt;

This might be the move that I waited but
got stopped out. I shorted crude oil on Friday afternoon below the 82
resistance. It was an undocumented trade. Now I am closing at a loss.
It's a slap on the hand for breaking my own trading rules. Oil broke
above 82 over the weekend. Fortunately, the opening gap was filled
before noon and I took the opportunity to cover my short. I was down 1%
at the open. Good thing I didn't panic and waited patiently (with a hard
stop just below the opening low) for a more rational exit. My planned
stop was \$9.15, the opening low was \$8.87, and I covered at \$9.12.
Just a tad under my plan but a lot higher than the low so far. Figure 1
is a chart of U.S. Oil Fund (USO) at the time of my exit. I traded the
Horizons BetaPro Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) as a vehicle for shorting
crude oil. The chart of USO is a better proxy of crude oil prices as
it's a few magnitudes higher volume (i.e. more popular) than HOD.TO.
From the looks of it, I will stay on the sideline until at least the
midterm election in the United States next week. Loss for this trade is
(\$9.12 - \$9.29) * 300 = -\$51 - \$9.90 commission = -\$60.90 = -0.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

today. EURUSD looks to be trading in a range. And since FOMC and G20 are
right around the corner, I am not expecting the market to do anything
drastic (i.e. breakout). So I am shorting commodity (to long US dollar)
as EUR/USD is at the top of its channel (Fig. 1). I picked Horizons
BetaPro Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) because it's one of the most active
reverse ETF on the TSX. I considered buying HFD.TO (for shorting
financials) but that one has a fraction of the volume of HOD.TO. The
falling star candle right below the 82.50 resistance on the hourly chart
of crude oil (Fig. 2) is also a factor in my timing. Risk is (\$9.19 -
\$9.05) * 300 = \$42 + \$9.90 commission = \$51.90 = 0.5% of account.

still hanging on the ceiling approaching the close. [caption id=""

close my gold short soon after the TSX market open to collect some quick

leveraged gold short, on Friday and unloaded it this Tuesday. I fought
against my greed to hold just a little longer. But the ascending support
line on gold is too obvious to ignore (Fig. 1). Thus I closed this short
term position with this 5%+ gap up while the market is still deciding
what to do. Furthermore, I noticed the equities market are holding
rather well at the open. S&amp;amp;P500 held onto 1170 price level. Asian
markets were marginally green overnight. And even the CAC in Europe is
fighting an intraday low as the North American markets open. Thus, the
sky is not falling just yet. I figured it would take more omph to push
this market further down as we are indeed in a strong bullish move. At
the very least I am expecting some retaliation from the bulls. This
can't be this easy for the bears, can it?&lt;/p&gt;

I am shorting my favourite asset,
gold. Spot gold was trading at 1372 at the time of my short during lunch
hour (see Fig. 1). I bought 350 shares of Horizons BetaPro Gold Bear
Plus ETF (HGD.TO) to short gold. It is just more convenient to do that
in my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/"&gt;RRSP trading account at Questrade&lt;/a&gt;. I am well aware of the
deteriorating value of a leveraged ETF (especially bearish ones). So I
don't intend to hold this for more than a few days. The reason for this
trade is simple. Today Bernanke made it clear that QE2 is on (WSJ:
&lt;a href="http://on.wsj.com/atEQ2z"&gt;Bernanke Makes Case for Further Fed Moves to Boost Economy&lt;/a&gt;).
Coincidentally, note the orchestrated weakening upward momentum across
precious metal (Fig. 1), currency (Fig. 2), and equities (Fig. 3).
Perhaps this is a matter of buy the rumour and sell the news? I am
betting that this rocket is running out of fuel. If I am wrong, I have
my stop set with a limited risk. If I am right, there's a long way down
from up here. So this trade is merely a matter of exploiting good
risk/reward. Stop is set at HGD.TO \$9.90. Anything below \$10.20 will
be a sign of caution. Maximum risk is (\$10.26 - \$9.90) * 350 = \$126

12.60 is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level for MFC. It made a textbook

This time on Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) with a
January 2011 put at 14 strike price. MFC is trading at \$13.25 at time
of entry. Recent series of &lt;a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-bank-story-no-one-is-talking-about-2010-09-10"&gt;prop desk closings&lt;/a&gt; isn't going to bode
well for the market, particularly for the banks as they need to
recuperate those easy income. On top of it, the lack of push from the
bulls this week as S&amp;amp;P test 1110 resistance doesn't look promising
either. Yet, this could very well be a bear trap. In any case, I am
taking a bearish bet via shorting MFC. Figure 1 shows a chart of MFC. It
is depressed and it is struggling. Moreover, MFC keeps announcing
billions of dollars worth of share offerings lately. I like it. There is
a distinct possibility of a bear raid if MFC can break this \$13.50
resistance level. The gap above \$15 is just staring at me. Hard stop is
at \$1.00 premium. Worst case risk for this trade is thus (\$1.70 -
\$1.00) * 4 * 100 = 280 + \$27.90 commission = \$307.90 = 3.2%.
However, I'd be very cautious if MFC closes above \$13.50. [caption

the following intermarket observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yesterday's equities sell-off held around S&amp;amp;P at 1050&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overnight Asian market seem orderly, not every market followed
    through, but most did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European markets down move were slow overnight until US open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But perhaps most importantly, EUR/USD made a higher low with an
    increasing COT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, as much as the sell-off tries to scare off people, the
markets don't seem to be moving in unison. So it would seem this move
(in equities, thus inverse USD) is still a bear trap in an intermediate
term bull rally. Plus this daily chart, Figure 1, for picking USDCAD
