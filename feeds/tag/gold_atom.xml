yesterday so I had to reassess the position. I sold my shares at \$0.56
for a loss of (\$0.56 - \$0.62) * 1000 = \$70 + \$19.90 commission =
\$89.90 = 0.9% of account. Gold is falling while USD tanked this week.
The lack of volume on today's goldminers rally is also uncharacteristic
of the recent uptrend. The long term uptrend of gold and gold miners is
unmistakable on both fundamental and technical basis. I am taking a
dabble in this junior gold miner as its share price is making a gap fill
on a recent breakout (Fig. 1), amongst other things. Intraday chart
(Fig. 2) is also showing signs of life at this support level. What's
going to happen to gold as it breaks below 1350 (first time since
November) from worries about Chinese inflation, which led to strength in
USD (on fear of further Chinese tightening) as EURUSD dropped 60 pips in
2 hours. See FT: &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ab89d906-244e-11e0-a89a-00144feab49a.html"&gt;Fears grow that China is overheating&lt;/a&gt;. Couple that
with political and economic uncertainty, we have a short term
uncertainty in gold's direction. However, all these is in line with the
underlying gold-bug case that money is becoming more worthless as
governments pump in money to their respective economies. Another point
to note is that as the Shanghai Composite and Bombay Stock Exchange
(i.e. growth markets) are making 3-month lows in recent weeks, people
will start to look for other assets to diversify their wealth. This is
all conjectures anyway. I can't predict the future.I am merely placing
my bet as the stars seem to have aligned for me to increase the
probability of this good reward/risk trade. Mental stop is \$0.55. Hard
stop is \$0.48, however, I'll give it some margin and say 0.40 is my
stop as liquidity is thin in this junior. Thus, risk is (\$0.62 -
\$0.40) * 1000 = \$220 + \$9.95 commission = \$229.95 = 2.4% of
account. Note: You might have noticed that my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/"&gt;trade log&lt;/a&gt; style has
changed for 2011. I am trying to jot down my thought process rather than
the data analysis and numerical logic to better capture my &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;
for the record.&lt;/p&gt;

It got stopped out
2 minutes before the close for a small profit. Following the &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-350-hgd-to-10-84-profit-2/"&gt;covering
of my short side play this morning&lt;/a&gt;, I sneaked back in to the gold bug
camp. In particular, I bought some of my recent favourite gold miner,
Ventana Gold Corp. (VEN.TO), a few minutes before the close. Gold held
on to the 1330 support as I've discussed this morning (see &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-350-hgd-to-10-84-profit-2/"&gt;gold chart
in this morning's post&lt;/a&gt;). I
also watched the closing 30 minutes of the market and VEN.TO respected
its 8.90 support level too. See Figure 1. There was a brief touch below
8.90 but it pushed back up quickly (not shown). This is a play inline
with the direction of the recent rally. Just riding the trend. Nothing
fancy. Hard stop is \$8.80. Mental stop is \$8.88. Maximum risk is
(\$8.95 - \$8.80) * 300 = \$45 + \$9.90 commission = \$54.90 = 0.5% of
account. There's a risk of another gap down open tomorrow. So my
position is small in case the market runs away overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

close my gold short soon after the TSX market open to collect some quick
profit. Rinse and repeat. I did mention that this trade is a short term
swing. I &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-am-sorry-my-precious-bought-350-hgd-to-10-26/"&gt;bought this Horizons BetaPro Gold Bear Plus (HGD.TO)&lt;/a&gt;, a
leveraged gold short, on Friday and unloaded it this Tuesday. I fought
against my greed to hold just a little longer. But the ascending support
line on gold is too obvious to ignore (Fig. 1). Thus I closed this short
term position with this 5%+ gap up while the market is still deciding
what to do. Furthermore, I noticed the equities market are holding
rather well at the open. S&amp;amp;P500 held onto 1170 price level. Asian
markets were marginally green overnight. And even the CAC in Europe is
fighting an intraday low as the North American markets open. Thus, the
sky is not falling just yet. I figured it would take more omph to push
this market further down as we are indeed in a strong bullish move. At
the very least I am expecting some retaliation from the bulls. This
can't be this easy for the bears, can it?&lt;/p&gt;

I am shorting my favourite asset,
gold. Spot gold was trading at 1372 at the time of my short during lunch
hour (see Fig. 1). I bought 350 shares of Horizons BetaPro Gold Bear
Plus ETF (HGD.TO) to short gold. It is just more convenient to do that
in my &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/"&gt;RRSP trading account at Questrade&lt;/a&gt;. I am well aware of the
deteriorating value of a leveraged ETF (especially bearish ones). So I
don't intend to hold this for more than a few days. The reason for this
trade is simple. Today Bernanke made it clear that QE2 is on (WSJ:
&lt;a href="http://on.wsj.com/atEQ2z"&gt;Bernanke Makes Case for Further Fed Moves to Boost Economy&lt;/a&gt;).
Coincidentally, note the orchestrated weakening upward momentum across
precious metal (Fig. 1), currency (Fig. 2), and equities (Fig. 3).
Perhaps this is a matter of buy the rumour and sell the news? I am
betting that this rocket is running out of fuel. If I am wrong, I have
my stop set with a limited risk. If I am right, there's a long way down
from up here. So this trade is merely a matter of exploiting good
risk/reward. Stop is set at HGD.TO \$9.90. Anything below \$10.20 will
be a sign of caution. Maximum risk is (\$10.26 - \$9.90) * 350 = \$126

steam despite gold prices hitting record high seemingly on a daily

the open but it quickly reversed (Figure 1). I upped my stop order at
the open on this third attempt because I don't want to be holding it if
it fails for the third time. I'll just sit and wait for a while to see
how this one goes. Recent low at \$10.40 is the support to watch.
Coincidentally, the 50 daily MA just crossed over the 200 MA today for a

gold price took a dive (Figure 1) before the Bank of England minute
today. However, the support at 10.50 look very promising as VEN.TO made
a couple of successful long tail test of that level in the last 24 hours
(Fig. 2). Seeing that the BoE has blatantly admitted to support the
bandwagon on &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-28/posen-says-bank-of-england-should-buy-more-assets-to-support-economy.html"&gt;more quantitative easing&lt;/a&gt; (along with the FED), the
bullishness in gold is written on the wall. As such, I am re-entering my
VEN.TO position this morning with a smaller amount of shares. New stop
is a close of VEN.TO below 10.50. Volatility is expected to be high. So
I am giving it some intraday leeway to move. A hard stop is set at
10.20. Risk is thus (\$10.67 - \$10.20) * 250 = \$117.50 + \$9.90

I am admittedly being quite aggressive here. Let's wait and see if it
pays off.&lt;/p&gt;

nothing good out there&lt;/a&gt; today. Yes, I eat my words often. So I took a
long position in Ventana Gold Corp (VEN.TO). That cup-and-handle
breakout from \$9.00 is just textbook (Fig. 1). I am indeed a bit late,
but the trend is now upward. There is a big resistance at \$10. It is
where the June epic decline started. From just above \$10 to \$6.5
between June and July. Now that VEN is back at this level again. I am
betting that the positive momentum would carry it upward. My hard stop
is \$8.90. My mental stop is \$9.50. As VEN seem to like to gap at
\$9.50. From the look of it, \$9.50 level is more important than \$10.
Since we're above it already, this gives me a bit more confidence in
this trade. Another point to note is gold price. It is on a direct train
to test, and possibly, break a new high record (Fig. 2). Risk is (\$9.74

(PAA.TO) is making another run to test the
short term high. Seeing that the volume is relatively higher on this
test of \$24.80 resistance (Figure 1) and that I have &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-200-k-to-15-94/"&gt;lowered my mental
stop to \$24.30&lt;/a&gt;, I have ditched this short position at a small loss
at 10 am today. I am mostly in cash again. I still have a small bullish
position in Kinross Gold. I'll just be letting it run its course. I have
no idea which way the market is going at this 1080 junction on the S&amp;amp;P.
There are some important supports just below. I will keep my hands off
until the market decides which way it will go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss is (\$2.27 - \$2.25) * 3 * 100 = \$6 + \$25.90 commission =
\$31.90 = 0.3%&lt;/p&gt;
