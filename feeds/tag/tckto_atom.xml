lasted mere minutes. I bought Teck Cominco (TCK.B.TO) after a small
bounce at \$34 support during lunch today. Figure 1 shows the clear
support level. Also note the fact that &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-43-mark-16-27-loss-0-5/"&gt;my recent shorts haven't been
working&lt;/a&gt;, so I thought I would go with the flow and go long. [caption

immediately after my long entry (something I haven't done in a while).
TCK cracked the \$34 support swiftly to \$33.80, my mental support. My
alert was sounded and I kept an eye on it afterward. But then not long
after \$33.80, my hard stop at \$33.70 was filled and TCK traded down to
\$33.66 or so. It has now stabilized around \$33.80 as of 2pm. Figure 2
shows the intraday chart of TCK.B.TO. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

for this trade is (\$33.68 - \$34.10) * 250 = -\$105 - \$4.95 * 2
commission = -\$114.90 = -1.2% of account. My account is now
experiencing a 3.4% drawdown since &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/"&gt;the high on June 8th&lt;/a&gt;. I can't
help but feel that this was a stop hunt. TCK is creeping higher at the
moment. However, as my initial position was stopped out, I am not going
to re-enter this trade just yet. Let's see what it does near the close
today. I am labelling this particular trade as a &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/"&gt;bad trade&lt;/a&gt; because
my stop was clearly too tight based on the time frame that I am
observing. I should have reduced my position size and widened my stop to
account for the recent volatility. Update: TCK gapped down 7% the day
after. At least my exit was timely.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="bad trade"></category><category term="entry"></category><category term="exit"></category><category term="Mining"></category><category term="TCK.TO"></category></entry></feed>
