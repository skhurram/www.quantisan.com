Contest doesn't need to be 100% automatic! According to &lt;a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/forex/jforex/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;amp;t=4771&amp;amp;sid=2ff0fd1b7645652d5f57821451586b08"&gt;Contest Support
in the official forum&lt;/a&gt;, I can set parameters like take profit target,
stop loss, and long-only or short-only trades. That make this contest
substantially easier to program as I can implement a semi-automatic
strategy, which is what I prefer in my real trading. The problem with
building an automated trading system is that market conditions change
frequently and without notice. Thus, it takes more than a few lines to
program a consistently profitable system to filter out undesirable
conditions. As I discussed before, because all winners in this contest
have to publish their source codes, &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reading-the-fine-print-for-dukascopy-jforex-strategy-contest/"&gt;I don't want to spend too much time
on this contest&lt;/a&gt;. Now that I know I can trade semi-automatically in
this contest. I can just do my analysis manually and then use the
strategy to execute trades when I so desire. That is exactly like &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-is-your-trading-process/"&gt;my
real trading process&lt;/a&gt; as illustrated before. As you can imagine, I am
very happy of this news. I don't need to scratch my head anymore to
build a new strategy for next month's contest. I programmed and tested
several new ideas in the past 2 weeks but haven't found anything better
than &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/"&gt;my existing strategy&lt;/a&gt;, which has been doing well in April. This
Dukascopy JForex Strategy Contest has been a great incentive for me to
become familiar with JForex. As I intend to use it for my &lt;a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/"&gt;real trading
at Dukascopy&lt;/a&gt; (open an account with this affiliate link to receive 35%
rebate on commissions) later this year, this is a win-win situation for
me as I learn the API and possibly win some prize money at the same
time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="API"></category><category term="JForex"></category></entry><entry><title>Comparing Trading API from 6 Online Forex Brokerages</title><link href="http://www.quantisan.com/comparing-trading-api-from-6-online-forex-brokerages/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-14T07:28:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Paul Lam</name></author><id>tag:www.quantisan.com,2010-04-14:comparing-trading-api-from-6-online-forex-brokerages/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Choosing a discount broker for forex trading is time consuming. As the
forex market is not centralized, choosing a discount broker is sort of
like picking a stall in a farmer's market. They all offer the same
product, but prices, features, quality, and services can vary
considerably between fx brokerages. One criteria that I consider
seriously is the Application Programming Interface (API) offered by the
broker. Most people couldn't care less about API because they never
intend to develop their own automated trading program. However, if this
is something that interests you, then I'd like to save you some time
here with the following table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Forex brokers

I highlighted the important limitation of each API. I have different
level of experience with each of these six APIs. As of this writing, I
am using &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/jforex/"&gt;JForex&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/"&gt;Dukascopy&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/in-a-forex-brokers-and-trading-platforms-jumble/"&gt;various personal reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
