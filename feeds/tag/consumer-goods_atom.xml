LLL.TO is testing its recent high
at \$40.50. However, volume is rather low up to now. I'm out my
Lululemon (LLL.TO) position because of market softness. Bonds (TLT) are
holding a support level. EUR/USD is struggling to hold above 1.27. And
the oversea markets (Asia and Europe) are weak overnight. Perhaps the
market is getting ready to catapult up. Perhaps it is not. But I'm not
going to place my bet on anything as I don't have a clue where it's
about to go at the moment. So I am stopping out of this position at
breakeven. Preserving capital. Moreover, recent price move in Lululemon
(LULU on Nasdaq) is disappointing. Despite the market marking new
consecutive highs for the past few days, LLL is stuck in a rut as shown
in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purchase price of these shares were &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-140-lll-to-39-86/"&gt;\$39.86 from a week ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exact return is (\$40 - \$39.86) * 140 = \$19.60 - \$9.90 commission =
\$9.70. In any case, I'm all cash in my account now. At least I've free
myself from the market for the next two weeks during my trip to Hong
Kong. Here's an updated view of the daily chart of LLL.&lt;/p&gt;

indicator of Figure 1. We are seeing a positive divergence from the
upticking companies above 50-dma/200-dma ratio (solid line in main
graph) and the lower low on the TSX. Furthermore, TSX index price has
been holding a longer term support at 11000 despite a new recent low on
the number of companies above their respective 200 day moving average
(top indicator) . The CDNV to TSX ratio is also showing a similar
positive divergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I am taking a bullish step with a cautious long position in
Lululemon (LLL.TO). There's a strong uptrend in this one as shown in
Figure 2. \$37.50 looks like a long term support. However, my stop is
\$38-\$39 zone to be in sync with the market move. Also, the gap to
\$37.50 support has been closed previously already in May, so a second
re-test wouldn't bold well for LLL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Lululemon
Athletica (LLL.TO)"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO.png" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO.png"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the chart, LLL currently has an enormous 22.79% short
floats according to &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/finviz/"&gt;Finviz&lt;/a&gt;. It is 70.51% owned by the big money with
a 3.72% increase in holding in the last quarter. Short squeeze, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took timed my entry based on intraday chart Figure 3. The top gap
today held for the first hour at least and then there were some
increased volume at the intraday support. I entered then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="LLL.TO intraday

&lt;p&gt;However, LLL touched \$40 and is now retraced below \$39.50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mental stop is \$39.00 and my hard stop is \$38.50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a risk of (\$38.50 - \$39.86) * 140 = \$190.40 + \$9.90
commission = \$200.30 = 2.13%.&lt;/p&gt;
