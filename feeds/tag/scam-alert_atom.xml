One of the frontpage stories in my local newspaper today tells the tale
of how a [Deadly crash shattered teacher's life][]. A young couple is
left permanently paralyzed for one and crippled for the other. All
because of "brazen and aggressive" driving of two other drivers. Alan
Kippax was racing with his cousin Peter Kippax on the street. Peter lost
control of his Porsche and crashed into the aforementioned young
couple's Pontiac. Peter died in the crash and Alan was sentenced to be
guilty of his contribution in this tragedy. While this is certainly a
sad news, unfortunately, it isn't rare either. And what does it have to
do on my trading blog? You see, it is actually the last line of the
article that really caught my attention.

&gt; Kippax, who used to run an emerald marketing network, Ontario Treasure
&gt; Traders International, is global sales manager for Business In Motion.

Business In Motion. That rings a bell in my head. Exactly a year ago,
[CBC News aired an investigative journal][] on this company. In the
show, PSA President Robert L. FitzPatrick concludes:

&gt; BIM is a blatant pyramid scam which ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ by its design
&gt; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ will inflict losses on 90+% of all consumers who
&gt; are ensnared. from Pyramid Scheme Alert

Alan Kippax (the one alive) was never charged or questioned in Canada
regarding BIM. Even though he was convicted of fraud by the government
of England in another pyramid scheme and in lieu of overwhelming
evidence against him and BIM here in Canada. It is sad that it takes
another tragedy to bring to justice another tragedy. Yet, I find it
incredibly just that at least one more financial scam has come to an
end, although in an unfortunate manner. As for Kippax. I feel no remorse
for him. A loved one dies in his face and he's left alive to bear the
consequences of his crime (not to the full extent, but still) in prison.
How fitting is that for a scammer? (Yes, I am evil.) My questions are,
why are there still so many financial scams out there, right in our
backyards, in this so-called information age? Is our government
deliberately turning a blind eye or are they really that incompetent?
How many more [Madoff cases][] will it take for us to wake up to this
problem?

ever more unscrupulous trading system sellers to spread their high yield
scams. Just to be clear, I am not against websites such as &lt;a href="http://www.myfxbook.com"&gt;Myfxbook&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://www.covestor.com"&gt;Covestor&lt;/a&gt;, nor against trading system sellers in general.
However, there are always bad apples in a basket. And there are many bad
apples out there. Trading social sites typically nurture a community of
traders by enforcing &lt;strong&gt;transparent&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;audited&lt;/strong&gt; trading history.
Unfortunately, it is because of this claim, people are enticed by
trading systems showing unbelievable high yields of 200%, 400%, 800%, or
even more in mere weeks on sites such as Myfxbook or Covestor. But if
the history of every trade taken is published and the account is
verified, doesn't that mean that they are just really that good? First
of all, if these people can double or triple their accounts in a few
weeks or months as they claim, why the heck are they selling their
system to you for a few hundred bucks and lose their monopoly?! If you
have a Lamborghini in your garage, do you rent it out for a few hundred
bucks to total strangers? Common sense should be on red alert. For sake
of argument, let's say that you give them the benefit of the doubt. All
is not as simple as it seems though. Here is one old trick in the book
scammers may use to game a transparent and audited trade history. I will
use &lt;a href="http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Pheniox/sir-lancelot/1806"&gt;one of the top performers currently on Myfxbook&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate
how their scam work. And surprise, surprise, this particular system is
on sale for a limited time (will see why later) for only US\$365. Figure
1 is the account percentage growth graph of this particular system. 488%
gain in 4 months!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Account growth

statistics. Remember, these are &lt;strong&gt;real, audited numbers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Trade
performance statistics"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradestats.png" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradestats.png"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;[/caption] Aside from the impressive
90% success rate (something &lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-goldman-sachs-robbed-you-and-me-of-3-billions-in-3-months/"&gt;only Goldman Sachs can achieve&lt;/a&gt;
consistently), the rest of the numbers actually look quite normal.
Notice that their average pips won and lost are both around 13 pips. So
this is supposedly a short-term scalping strategy to catch small but
high probability moves. Which does exist in real life, as you know. Then
as if you're not convinced of their awesomeness yet, here's a snapshot
of some recent trade history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Trade
history"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradehist.png" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradehist.png"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;[/caption] This is where you might start to raise
some eyebrows. Observe that 5 out of 8 trades shown are minuscule gains
but they have &lt;strong&gt;no stop loss&lt;/strong&gt; in place! That's not a problem, per se.
Some systems don't use an open stop order. However, notice the open and
closing time. These suspicious trades were held for almost a day! That's
like an eternity for a scalping system. Who knows how much drawdown have
occurred in the account during those hours! Actually, we do, take a look
at the figure below for an open order of this system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Open
trade"][&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_opentrades.png" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_opentrades.png"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;[/caption] Caught red-handed! The open order shows a
gigantic loss running. See the -\$9290 loss being held? That's about a
third of their current balance of \$29k! But here's the trick. What the
system does is wait for market noise to swing the price back to
breakeven and then close the trade for a +1 pip. As the trade isn't
closed at the moment, this humongous drawdown doesn't count as a loss
and is nowhere to be seen in the trading history. That is what happens
with many of those unusually small pips but long-held trades as
discussed above. In effect, they are risking their entire account
balance on just a few pips of profit on every trade. The reason why many
of these unbelieveable systems typically have a trade history of only a
few months at most? That isn't just for show. Sooner or later, their
luck runs out with this no-stop rule and the market will have them choke
down those monstrous losses. Eventually, their account just blows up.
But at that point, they can make a switch-aroo and pull up another
trading history that hasn't blown up yet to replace this one that just
failed. Then it's business as usual. What's more amusing is thatsomeone
asked this question of why there is a huge drawdown in another huge
drawdown open trade months ago. The response from the author is that it
was just a careless programming mistake. Imagine, here they are selling
a massively "profitable" system on one hand and then claiming a glitch
on another. In summary, &lt;strong&gt;the key to a statistically 100% winning
system&lt;/strong&gt; is simple. Follow the trend with no stop and only close a trade
with a positive gain. But as I've explained the fallacies with this
approach above, &lt;strong&gt;never try that with your money&lt;/strong&gt; as you are risking
all for so little! For general advice on avoiding forex scams, the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex_scam"&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt; offers an overview and ForexCrunch has a good
