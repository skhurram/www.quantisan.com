The
day before, CIBC shares were testing \$63 (in the states). Today, after
the announcement, CIBC opened at \$60.94.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the open, Bloomberg (for example) had this headline, &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=aZ3Jl5_CknSc"&gt;CIBC Profit
Rises Fivefold on Capital Markets.&lt;/a&gt; Note the wording. This is not the
same as profits is five times as before. Did they hire a lawyer to write
this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the open, in which CIBC (CM) shares gapped down about 5% (!),
headlines such as Toronto Star's&lt;span&gt;
[&lt;span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder_leftContentContainer_ListWebPart_SecondTierStories2_ctl00___Title__"&gt;TSX
falls on CIBC earnings&lt;/span&gt;][]&lt;/span&gt; began appearing at 10:30am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited:&lt;/strong&gt; Before I finished writing this, Toronto Star updated the
above headline to read
[&lt;span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder_article_NavWebPart_Article_ctl00___Title__"&gt;TSX
rises as U.S. housing numbers balance CIBC
earnings&lt;/span&gt;][&lt;span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder_leftContentContainer_ListWebPart_SecondTierStories2_ctl00___Title__"&gt;TSX
falls on CIBC
earnings&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder_article_NavWebPart_Article_ctl00___Title__"&gt;.
Ha! Tell that to the people that bought into CIBC at the open on the
earlier story. CIBC is still trading below \$60 at this point. Although
they would probably think CIBC is "cheap" now that it's below \$60 with
its "profit rising five fold". &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market tradition of buying the rumours and then selling on the
news for a stock is well known. Think of it this way, if CIBC is tanking
on this positive news now, what event do you think in the immediate
future will lift its price up? Also consider that CIBC has run from
\$27.50 in March 2009 to \$65 in July! The selling and profit-taking
pressure is simply humongous on CIBC at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what I found amusing is the flip-floppinge of tone of the media
(I guess I should get used to it by now, but no). One moment they're
spinning the story this way and before you even got through the page,
they're spinning it another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet another illustration of why I think most of the financial
mass media are nothing more than glorified advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update 11 am: Bloomberg changed their headline on that first link to
"&lt;span&gt;CIBC Profit Misses Estimates on Loan-Loss Provision". &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:30pm:&lt;/strong&gt; CIBC broke below \$59. If it breaks below
support at \$58.42 (Figure 2), then \$52.50 is just a breath away in
this roller coaster ride. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
