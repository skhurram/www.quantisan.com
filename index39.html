            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I wrote last Friday, I took a long position in Teck Resources
(TCK-B.TO) at \$36.03 but got <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-110-tck-b-to-36-03-stopped-out-at-breakeven/">stopped out at breakeven</a>. In
hindsight, the retracement after testing the \$37 resistance held the
50% level near the close. That was a bullish sign that I missed at the
time and only realized during my weekend review. As you know, the TSX
market gapped about 2% up and S&amp;P gapped about 4% up right at the open.
The market traded in a range all day but managed to hold the gap.
However, EUR/USD closed its gap and is testing 1.27 support as I write
this. The EUR/USD pair will be an important pair to watch as the
European Union drama unfolds. With regard to TCK, Figure 1 speaks for
itself. It gapped up about 8% and closed up 8.78% at \$39.53. I decided
not to chase the market early on today as the reward/risk ratio just
isn't as appealing anymore. There are always opportunities sailing
around the corner. So there is no need to go out of breath chasing that
one missed boat.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I typed a rather long reply on the SMB Training blog to <a href="http://www.smbtraining.com/blog/traders-ask-how-much-capital-do-i-need-to-trade">the question of
how much capital one needs to start trading</a>. So I thought I might as
well expand on this frequently asked question for traders visiting here.
Here is my process. The first thing to realize is the fact that trading
is a business. And like any business, the single most important question
to ask is -- what is your bottom line? That can be simplified to two
parts. What do you expect to make and what are your costs? Let's
consider your expectation first. You can't estimate your expectation if
you don't know what you did (that would be a haphazard guess). When I
dipped my hands in trading forex the first time. I started by paper
trading a demo account for a few months. As I was unfamiliar with
trading forex, that provided me with a risk-free opportunity to learn.
Equally more importantly, it serves as a Monte Carlo experiment (perhaps
more on this another time) to figure out my expected performance
statistics in this particular market (for example, here's my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">January
2010 review</a>). That is how you can scientifically derive your trading
expectation. Based on history. Yes, past performance is no guarantee of
future return. But at least it should give you a ballpark figure. So
unless someone can suggest a better method, you need to seriously grind
it out on a demo account first. (I only said this is straightforward. I
didn't say this is easy.) Fortunately, that is the hard part. Next step
to figuring out your costs is easy. Just calculate your trading
commission, data fees, etc. Then estimate how much fees you are paying
per trade. This is the cost basis of your trading. Then here are the
steps for calculating your initial capital need.</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate your average return percentage (of total principle) per
    trade from your paper trading.</li>
<li>Make an educated guess on your capital need, just to initialize the
    numerical process.</li>
<li>Calculate how much average amount of money you expect to make per
    trade using #1 and #2.</li>
<li>Divide your cost basis per trade with #3 to get a percentage of
    cost per trade.</li>
<li>Reiterate steps #2 to #4 until your percentage of cost per trade
    is acceptable. i.e. increase your capital (#2) if your percentage
    of cost is too high, and vice versa.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, say you expect to make an average +1% of your total account
per trade (step #1). Then let's say you thought an \$10,000 account is
enough (#2). \$10,000 x 0.01 = \$100. So you can expect to make an
average of \$100 per trade (#3). And let's say your fees is \$5 per
trade. A round-trip (buy and sell) would cost you \$5 x 2 = \$10. Thus,
#4 is found by \$10 / \$100 = 10%. Which means you'll be set back by
10% on every single trade. That cost percentage is too high. Then let's
double the capital to \$20,000 and go through steps #2 to #4 again.
Assuming your fees per trade is fixed, which is most likely for small
accounts. You'll find that your cost percentage is 5% for a \$20,000
account based on the same conditions. Perhaps 5% is acceptable for you?
If not, raise your capital estimate again and re-do the calculations (a
spreadsheet would be useful). The process is straightforward and
unambiguous. Once you've done your paper trading, the actual calculation
should take less time to do than reading this post.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update May 10: Looks like I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-illustration-of-what-it-means-by-missing-the-boat-in-trading/">missed the boat</a>. TCK.B gapped up almost
7% at the Monday open to \$38.88. I won't be chasing the market at this
point as the reward/risk ratio isn't appealing anymore. Update: I got
stopped out at breakeven (after commission) before I can post this piece
at the end of the day. I'm back to all cash going into the weekend. I am
taking a dip in Teck Resources (TCK/B.TO) with 110 shares bought at
\$36.03. This is a trade to "buy when everyone else is in fear".
Following my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-hell-and-back-a-review-of-tsx-after-a-v-day/">assessment of the market yesterday</a>, I don't think
things are that bad, yet. So I am establishing a small position in a
strong company today. TCK is trading on its 200 day moving average at
\$35 this week (Figure 1). Yesterday's epic dive and recovery didn't
break this \$35 support. So that's a very good sign for TCK.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Tech Resources
(TCK-B.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO.png" />][][/caption] Furthermore, \$35 is an obvious
psychological round number support. It is also above the recent low of
\$32.50 printed in February of this year as shown in Figure 1. The
oscillator value (top of Figure 1) is making a positive divergence as
TCK is testing this support level). I entered today based on the 5-day
intraday chart. This morning's opening hour test of \$35 support has
lower volume than earlier this week (Figure 2). As such, I think \$35
can hold. So I entered when the price shot above minor resistance at
\$36.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TCK-B.TO

drifted back under \$35.50 after I entered but then reversed and tested
\$37. I moved my stop loss to breakeven as it touched an equidistance
price opposite of my stop. Just so I don't see profits turn into losses.
If I get stopped out today, I will not re-enter until after the weekend.
My target is \$40 and original stop was \$35 for about a 4 to 1 reward
to risk ratio. I am risking 1.25% in this trade with a position size of
110 shares.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As every trader knows already, the Dow tanked 1,000 points (about 9%) in
like 15 minutes today. But what's more amazing is that all the indices
made their way back just as quickly. Figure 1 below is today's chart of
TSX Composite (blue) and S&amp;P 500 (red). So what does this mean for TSX?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-06-TSX-SPX.png"><img alt="TSX Composite and S&amp;P 500" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-06-TSX-SPX.png" /></a> Let's zoom
out to take a look at the big picture. Figure 2 is a weekly chart of
TSX. The top indicator is the percentage of TSX traded issues above
their 200 day moving average. The overlay indicator is the percentage of
TSX traded issues above their 50 day moving average. The lower indicator
is the percentage of issues above 200 MA divided by the percentage above
their 50 MA.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TSX
Composite"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-06-TSX-200-50.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>The TSX index is an aggregate of prices from a handful of companies. But
there are over three thousand issues trading on the TSX. This view of
Figure 2 provides another perspective of where the market stands.</p>
<p>The question to be answered is this, how much technical damage did
today's sell-off produce?</p>
<p>Not much apparently.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, both the 200 and 50 numbers are at their respective
support after the close. This is as low as we have been in the past 9
months or so. However, they are still hanging high above according to
the 200 percentage. There are still 56.5% of companies above their 200
day moving average.</p>
<p>On the shorter term though, the 50 number is pretty low at 30%. Only 30%
of companies are above their 50 day moving average.</p>
<p>Referring to the historical pattern as shown on Figure 2. Typically
numbers 30 or below means that the down move is exhausting. Since most
(70%) companies are trading low already, so there's not much room for
big dives until the market can reload. It is interesting that we touched
30% this week yet the TSX index is still not down that much in the big
picture.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I am still bearish on the market in the long run.
But I don't think today's move is the beginning of <em>the</em> dive. Since
volatility has contracted to a recent record low, this move is just a
shake-out of the bulls. Is this the end of this down move? I don't know.
But I expect to see at least an opposite shake-out of the bears soon
before any real move can materialize. Control your risks in expectation
of big ups and downs in the near future.</p>
<p>It's just too good to be true for the bears that the market makes a
U-turn and head straight down after congesting below a support level for
weeks.</p>
<p>In terms of my trading, I'm all cash today. So it was fun to watch the
move with no strings attached. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-12-cve-to-puts-2-90-mark-27-50-10-gain/">covered my CVE.TO shorts yesterday</a>
at a decent price. CVE.TO broke down further today during the panic but
ended up closing slightly higher. So my exit was good as I couldn't have
covered during that rapid breakdown.</p>
