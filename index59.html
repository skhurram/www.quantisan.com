            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As a part-time trader, measuring my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/monthly-review.html">monthly trading performance</a> can
be as simple or as complex as it can be. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being
just reading the percent return from the account statement and 10 being
running a statistical analysis, my preferred trading performance
measurement method is a simple 3. I am lazy but want a metric that is
useful for monthly self-evaluation. That is why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_alpha">Jensen's alpha</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio">Sharpe ratio</a> have appealed to me. Both of these ratios are can be
easily derived. However, 3 shortcomings of these metrics made me decide
not to use them for my forex trading. First is the fact that they
emphasize <em>excess return</em> with respective of the market. It makes sense
to compare a portfolio with the overall market on a long term basis. But
what if you want to do month-by-month, or even week-by-week analysis?
Short-term market volatility could skew your performance metric up/down
even when you have been performing consistently. Furthermore, what if it
is an out-right bear market? Your short-side strategy would be boosted
by the negative return of the market. For a swing trader such as myself,
a shorter time-frame and long/short unbiased measurements are
non-trivial matters for analysing trading performance. Secondly, neither
metrics factor in volatility of a market. A 5% return in a calm market
is not the same as 5% in a volatile market. If you go out to fish in a
storm, you'd better expect a huge payout to compensate for the extra
risk. Lastly, I don't like their definition of risk. For me, a
short-term performance ratio can sufficiently be characterized as reward
/ risk. Jensen's alpha calculation has no explicit measurement of risk
at all. Whereas Sharpe takes the standard deviation of the portfolio's
return as the risk value. For a monthly analysis, I would have to use a
daily or weekly drawdown to calculate the standard deviation. The
problem with using the daily is that it's too much work for me to do
manually on my spreadsheet. As for the weekly, having just 4 weeks in a
month <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_size">is not a sufficient sampling size</a> to calculate a
representative standard deviation. In summary, here are my 3 reasons for
not using Jensen's alpha and Sharpe ratio.</p>
<ol>
<li>Emphasis on excess return with respect to the market</li>
<li>No consideration for volatility of the market</li>
<li>Not agreeing on their definition of risk</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, there are numerous reasons why these metrics are the
standard portfolio measurments used by many traders. Heck, Jensen's
alpha and Sharpe ratio have been around for 40 years and are still
widely in use today. However, they are just not suitable for me as
discussed. The thing is, there are countless number of new and old
portfolio measurements out there. What one chooses to use depend on
various factors such as your style of trading, your agenda, and your
interest in this topic. In my next post, I will introduce the metric
that I use for my monthly trading performance analysis -- <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/">a modified
Sterling ratio</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Black Swan Events or 4-sigma moves (e.g. 1987 Black Monday and 2008
crash) in the markets are by definition hard to predict. Hard, but not
impossible. Experienced traders utilize prudent risk management to
shield themselves from monstrous losses, and some can even <a href="http://www.xtrenders.com/2008/10/dare-to-short-this.html">profit
immensely from them</a>. However, for us average folks, is there some
kind of simple warning signs that could give us a heads up to these sort
of extraordinary moves? In this post, I will introduce a simple leading
indicator that seems to do the job quite well. I will talk about what it
is and why it seems to work. Of course, this is merely based on limited
observations and is not to be construed as a vigorous analysis. The
particular indicator I am referring to is the <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=GOOGLEINDEX_US:INVEST">Google Investing Index</a>
(GII). Figure 1 below shows the GII vs. S&amp;P 500 from 2004. The blue line
is the GII, the red line is the S&amp;P 500. What I have observed is that
rapid (in a month's time) rise from a negative reading to +20% reading
of GII correspond with a shift in sentiment in the market rather well.
Referring to Figure 1 below, this condition occurred 4 times since 2004.
I marked these 4 occurrences on the graph with green dots. As you can
see, they correspond with the double top on S&amp;P, first dive in the
crash, the big one in October 2008, and then even confirming the 666
reversal in March 2009. It seems to be a leading indicator for down
moves but lagging on upward reveral. Mostly noticeably though, is that
the GII gave extreme readings, and in the direction of our condition
(negative to positive jump), days before the big crash in October 2008.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Google Investing
Index vs. S&amp;P 500 (green dots mark signals)"][<img alt="Google Investing Index
vs. S&amp;P 500" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-12-15-GoogInvIndex.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-12-15-GoogInvIndex.png">Google Investing Index vs. S&amp;P 500</a>[/caption] While this
can be mere coincidence, here is why I think this index holds some
truth. The GII measures the amount of search traffic for topics relating
to investing in the U.S. And with Google dominating the online searching
market (<a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2009/11/comScore_Releases_October_2009_U.S._Search_Engine_Rankings">65% as of October 2009</a> according to comScore), we can assume
GII to measure what the general public is interested in. Now, as we
probably know, market extremes are driven by irrational emotions.
There's an old saying that goes like this, on market highs, when even
the taxi driver is giving you stock advice, it's time to get out of the
market. When all the people have invested already, who's left to buy and
drive the price even higher? This is ultimately a supply and demand
effect. While we can't count heads in the market, we can estimate market
sentiment. The GII is just one more way of doing that. And it does so by
giving us a reading of the market sentiment according to the general
public. You know, the last ones in the party to pickup the mess the pros
have have left behind. That is exactly what sets the GII apart from the
plethora of existing market sentiment indicators. It is a market
sentiment indicator on mass psychology, but a crude one at that. Scoring
4 out of 4 positives is good, but the small sample size render this a
mere observation of interest. I do not recommend trading on this
indicator. However, it does seem promising to serve as an additonal
input to an analytical system... In summary, here is the condition of
this GIS (for <strong>G</strong>oogle <strong>I</strong>nvesting index for market <strong>S</strong>entiment)
indicator.</p>
<ul>
<li>the condition is true for a turn in the market when GII jumps from a
    negative to +20% or more within a month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, notice that the GII is still low at the moment while many are
calling the top is imminent, or even that it has happened at 1120 in
recent weeks. Thus, according to GIS indicator, this market rally is
still intact.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>In my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/november-2009-trading-performance-review/">last month's performance review</a>, I said that one of my goals
for this month is to think more and trade less. But in my first week of
December, I have racked up 53 trades already... Average for October (a
normal month) was only 34, for the entire month. Now that we're in the
second week, I can clearly see my over-trading problem from my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trading
log</a> and say to myself that enough is enough. In terms of my account
balance, I'm experiencing a 1% drawdown because of these
"testing-the-water" trades. They are small positions that I micro-manage
to minimize the exposed risks by moving the stops every so often. But
the facts speak for itself, 53 trades in the first week, 23 winning
trades (acceptable), 1 % drawdown (bad). The problem with this hit and
miss approach is that it is taking too much of my time with no result to
show. It's true that a single week makes no difference in the long run.
But this just isn't my style of trading. It doesn't fit with my trading
strategy. This is over-trading. Why do people over-trade? Lack of
discipline. Desire to catch major moves. Afraid to miss a run.
Addiction. Boredom. and so on. Over-trading has been a major problem for
me back in the days when I tried <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-trading-report-jan-30-2008-560/">day trading index futures</a>. I
haven't had this problem for a couple of years now. Which is great. But
this bad habit is creeping back up on me. This time, it's because I am
staring at the trading screen too much once I am in a position and tried
to micro-manage my trades to minimize my risk. This obsession with
tightening my stops backfired and I took more trades because of it and
get stopped out more often before any sizable move can materialize. A
lose-lose situation. Since realizing that my arch-nemesis is back in
business, finding a solution to restrain myself is simple. I studied my
trading journal in the past few weeks to review my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">best trades</a>. The
solution to improve my performance and restrain myself from over-trading
is actually both sides of the same coin. I just need to focus on trading
my best timeframe. What do I really mean by that? Different players and
factors affect different timeframes in the markets. Thus, prices behave
differently in different timeframes. <a href="http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/">Dr. Steenbarger</a> has an
excellent post titled <a href="http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/12/lessons-for-developing-traders-more-on.html">Lessons for Developing Traders: More on What
Moves Markets</a> which talks about how different market participants
affects the way market's flow in different time frames. He uses the
analogy of visualizing the markets as an ocean. Global climate affects
the flow of waves across the ocean. At the same time, kids splashing at
a beach can also create ripples to these waves. Obviously, one is a
macro-phenomenon and the other is a localized event. Similarly, central
banks and institutions are what powers the long term trend of a market.
But market makers and retail traders can create ripples in the short
term. What works for one timeframe might not work for another. My
trading style has always been geared toward riding the bigger waves,
e.g. my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC setup</a>. So if I become affixiated with what's happening
with the short-term ripples, it would not only cause me to over-trade
but also affect my long-term strategy too. As such, here is what I will
do.</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on analysis from the weekly and daily charts.</li>
<li>Determine <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setup</a> only from daily and 3 hour charts.</li>
<li>Time my entries and exits from the 3 hour chart.</li>
<li>Execute my trade orders on the 30 minute chart and for short-term
    confirmation.</li>
<li>Use the 1 hour chart if necessary to scaling in or out a position.</li>
<li>Never enter or exit a trade based on the 30 min. chart (or anything
    less) alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, I have started following this process this week already and it
seems to be working well. I will review my performance at the end of the
month <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/monthly-review">as usual</a> to see how this goes.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Much has been written about when to buy stocks, forex, or other
instruments. In fact, it is the topic that is written the most about in
trading. As if there's nothing else to trading than timing your entries.
On the contrary, I have come to realize that timing for entries is
actually the least important aspect of a trade (see a real world prove
below). Nevertheless, it is still a factor for consideration in a
complete trading strategy. As such, this post is about the 4 fundamental
entry signs that I use to enter in any trade. No matter which trading
setup I am using, I only place my order because one or more of these
conditions are met. To make sure that everyone is on the same page. Let
me define what exactly I am talking about here. I define the act of
timing for an entry as the process for deciding <strong>where or when to place
an order</strong> after a signal has been flagged by a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setup</a>. In
particular, it would be step #8 according to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC setup</a>. For
example, if the conditions to buy USDCAD are met on the daily chart,
then I will zoom in on to the 3-hour timeframe to spot a confirmation of
the move. Once that is also satisfied, I zoom in even more to the
30-minute chart to spot when (if market order) or where (if limit order)
to place the order. Figuring out exactly when and where to place your
bet is a topic for much discussion, even when you know that you want to
buy it somewhere around this level. The better the price, the better
your reward/risk will be. Wait too long, and the market could leave you
behind. Long story short, when it comes down to it, there are simply 4
fundamental entry signs for buying in any market that I use. I only buy
at/when the price is:</p>
<ol>
<li>at a support area</li>
<li>at a Fibonacci retracement level</li>
<li>at oversold conditions</li>
<li>showing accumulation by large players</li>
</ol>
<p>(and vice versa for shorting a market) These are necessary, but not
sufficient entry conditions. One or more of these conditions must be met
for all trades. But satisfying these conditions would not guarantee
profitability. I know I've repeated this many times now, but I can't
stress this enough. This is just <strong>one small step</strong> of a thorough
analytical process in deciding your trade. Don't go around buying
everything on support levels or when RSI goes over 80. The reason why I
find it necessary to write about something so trivial now is that I have
just been caught trying to catch a top again. Take a look at the figure
below illustrating my trade orders trying to catch a USD/CAD short-term
top. My trading setup flagged for a short USDCAD trade. So I gave it a
few tries. Eight times. Eight! If only I had remembered my 4 fundamental
entry signs, I wouldn't have tried to short this pair all over the place
and getting stopped out again and again. If I adhered to these 4 signs,
I would have only tried it a couple of times at 1.0480 resistance and
then let it pass once the condition is violated. On the other hand, as I
was saying earlier that the entry is the least important aspect of a
trade. I came out of this mess as illustrated unscathed. I managed to
exit all of my entries at break-even, or at least close to it. So even
failing 8 entries, my account balance barely budged. Recall I said
timing for entries is the least important part of trading? Well, this is
a good example of it. You could mess up your entries, 8 times, and still
come out ok. You probably know this already, but I'll say this for the
sake of thoroughness. By far the most important aspect of a profitable
trading strategy is prudent <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>. That is what saved me
in this embarrassing shorting USD/CAD example.</p>
