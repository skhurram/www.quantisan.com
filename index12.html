            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The biggest problem I had when learning to program my own trading
strategies in JForex is finding where to start learning. There were few
JForex documentation available at the time and I had to teach myself
through painstaking trial and error with the help of Dukascopy's
technical support. Things have certainly changed for the better as a
JForex community is starting to sprout and documentation for it is at
least sufficient to get anyone started. This post is the first of a
series of quick beginner's guide to learning JForex programming by
putting all these resources in a tutorial.</p>
<h2>JForex is a Java tool</h2>
<p>JForex is actually not a programming language. It is an application
programming interface (API) for use with the standard Java programming
language. As such, the first step to learning to program in JForex is to
learn Java. Luckily, Java is one of the most popular programming
languages. So there're plenty of resources on and off the web to learn
Java programming. Some examples of free online tutorials are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/">The Java Tutorials</a> -- This is an official tutorial from the
    developer of Java themselves. Highly recommended.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.roseindia.net/java/beginners/">Beginners Java Tutorial</a> -- More geared for the absolute
    beginners to programming.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you prefer a book, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596009208?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=quantisan-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596009208">Head First Java, 2nd
Edition</a>. I brushed up on my Java from this book. Don't dwell on
Java too much though as you only need to know the basics to get started
with JForex. Just read a few chapters to understand the Java syntax and
then move on. You can always refer back to them later.</p>
<h2>Diving into JForex</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">JForex Wiki</a> is one of the three essential resources for JForex
programmers. I will be referring to some specific pages of the Wiki in
much of this series of posts. If you haven't done so already, <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">signup
for a DEMO account at Dukascopy</a>. Then launch the JForex platform and
follow the instructions on the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Use_in_JForex">Use in JForex</a> wiki page to assemble
your first JForex strategy!</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>So far so good? By this point, I hope you can understand basic Java
source code and know how to start/open, compile, and run a JForex
strategy. In the next post in this learning JForex series, we will
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/anatomy-of-a-jforex-strategy-part-1/">study the anatomy of a JForex strategy</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Dukascopy started a new contest this month. This contest is manual
trading only on a demo account with no cash commitment by contestants.
The twist is that the ranking is determined not only by your demo
account balance, but also the total pips gained, popularity, and scoring
by Dukascopy's judges. Each trade in the contest needs to be commented
by the contestant through the JForex trading platform (when you submit
an order the platform asks you for a comment). See <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/tradercontest/?action=blog&amp;trader=Quantisan">my contest page for
comment examples</a> (shameless plug). About half of your score is based
on these trade comments as they are the basis for generating popularity
points and the Dukascopy judges' final evaluation. I can see the
potential in this contest as it offers transparency and encourages
interactions rather than let everyone just gamble away. However, most of
the trade comments now are meaningless as it's clear that you can
generate buzz simply by making ridiculous gains. Perhaps this might
change after this month's final ranking is released as it is not clear
how Dukascopy will allocate each contestant's 25% of points. The judging
by Dukascopy can effectively bump or dump you a few ranking. The
incentive to do this is the USD \$15,000 'cash' prizes to be won every
month just like the Dukascopy Strategy Contest. And similarly, these
'cash' prizes are deposited into the winner's Dukascopy trading account
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reading-the-fine-print-for-dukascopy-jforex-strategy-contest/">with a withholding period</a>. So they're forcing you to open an account
with them if you win, which is understandable as this is a marketing
effort. For information or registration in the contest, <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">visit the
Dukascopy website</a> and navigate to the Trader Contest page.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>For some traders, building a trading system means that they focus on
finding the best indicators they could get their hands on or the one
trading setup that is backtested to work 99% of the time. All I can say
is, to each his own. For me, the keyword of a trading system lies not
with <em>trading</em>, but with <em>system</em>. Remember, it is a system. First of
all, it is a system <em>for trading</em>. Not a system <em>to trade</em>. What do I
mean by that? Consider this saying, "traders don't go broke by missing
opportunities, they go broke by taking too many." A trading system needs
to be selective. It needs <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">prudent risk management</a>. Secondly, you
need to generate your own market view to trade. Rather it be technical,
fundamental, sentimental, or just following some joe, you trade based on
your view. Trading is a test of your market hypothesis using money. If
you think the market will rise, you buy. If you think the market will
fall, you short. Lastly, a trading system needs to execute trades.
Otherwise you'd be an anlayst. It needs to time <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/entry/">entries</a> and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/exit/">exits</a>. Again, this could be as simple as on a whim or as complicated
as some n-th order algorithm. Thus we have the three pillars of a
trading system.</p>
<ol>
<li>Risk Management</li>
<li>Market Analysis</li>
<li>Trade Execution</li>
</ol>
<p>What's more, if we combine some of these pillars we get some well known
concepts. For example, market analysis + trade execution = trading
signals, wherein you derive signals based on market conditions to
execute trades. Or risk management + trade execution = position
management, wherein you manage your holdings by manipulating your trades
based on your risk profile. All these relationships and composition of a
trading system can be summarized with a Venn diagram. So, this is my
view of a trading system:</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>JFUtil is a Quantisan.com open-source project focused on reusable JForex
trading strategy components. Latest version is 2.1.3 released on April
8, 2011. Please <a href="#download">keep your local JFUtil library up to date</a> for the
latest patches and features.</p>
<h2>Main Features</h2>
<p><strong>1. Access to IContext and IAccount from anywhere in your project files.</strong> 
The one and only JForexContext object in JFUtil is a
thread-safe, singleton object which can be called from anywhere within
your projects, across any class file. No need to declare global IContext
variables. No need to pass it around in parameters. </p>
<p><strong>2. Simplify order submission with ticket builder.</strong> 
Set your trade order parameters with
an order ticket object using a builder constructor. You can build ticket
with as few or as many parameters as you like. All with intuitive method
names in the same ticket class. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">OrderTicket</span>
<span class="n">buySpTicket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">OrderTicket</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">Builder</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">label</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">instrument</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">IEngine</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">OrderCommand</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">BUY</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mf">0.1</span><span class="o">)</span>

</pre></div>


<p><strong>3. No more confusion about indicator methods.</strong> Indicators are
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/conjuring-beans-to-simplify-jforex-iindicators/">encapsulated into their own bean object</a> with their full function
name and parameters are set using intuitive, clearly described methods.</p>
