            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've had more time to study the market tonight and is running a second
and a third instances of Quantised Trading Desk (QTD) to trade 3
currencies in total simultaneously. For my dollar bull sentiment, I'm
dividing between USDJPY long and NZDUSD short. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-usdjpy-on-week-of-april-17-2011/">QTD still hasn't taken a
position in USDJPY in the past 24 hours</a>. That's a good thing as
USDJPY is still drifting downward today even as the dollar is gaining
some ground. My line in the sand is at 80.70 for USDJPY and above 0.8100
for NZDUSD. EURGBP long is a hedge against my dollar longs. Again, I'm
not making any trade at this point but merely <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/quantised-trading-desk/">setting up QTD to wait
for the right moments to enter</a>. A break below 0.8660 for EURGBP would
challenge my bullish bias. These three currencies should be my complete
market bias for a while. I'm just going to let QTD do its thing and
trade for me. Hopefully this will be the last you'll hear from me about
my market bias for a while. [caption id="attachment_5342"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have unofficially launched my Quantised Trading Desk (QTD) expert
system this weekend as the system is ready for live trading after almost
a year in development. You can't miss the announcement if you visit the
new frontpage of this blog. So, I won't talk about it anymore here. The
purpose of this post is to discuss my forex trade. It's been over 7
months since I've traded on the forex market. I have been working on QTD
during all these months to improve my overall trading. Anyway, let's
dive right to it for my first trade back into forex. I am bullish on the
U.S. dollar this week. Why? The Financial Times is letting on <a href="">rumours
that the US Fed is signalling an end to quantitative easing</a>.
Coincidentally, the U.S. dollar appears to be testing supports across
all major currencies. Secondly the US equities market hasn't been able
to make higher highs even as the dollar is marking new lows. Still, I'm
not one to call a bottom, nor am I hunting for one. This is merely a
good risk-reward trade to gun for an obvious move. In particular, USDJPY
appears to be the best of the bunch as its been holding well over the
past few months while the dollar crumbled. The fact that Europe and US
are rumoured to be lighting up on the money printing whereas Japan's
money printing press is on full steam for the quake reconstruction (Yen
bearish) is a decent excuse to place some chips on USDJPY. You might
have noticed, I haven't specified my entry price, amount, or stop loss
price as usual. This is because I am relying on the Quantised Trading
Desk expert system to trade USDJPY for me. QTD will monitor the market
for me and execute trade entries and exits as it sees fit to accumulate
a long position in USDJPY. All the risk management and quant analysis
are built into the system. So I don't have a position yet because I'm
waiting for QTD to do the grunt work. [caption id="attachment_5332"

                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/software-design-trading-development-process-and-ikea/" rel='bookmark'>Software design, trading development process, and Ikea</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I spent a few months between 2010 and 2011 not on the market, not on
coming up with new strategies, but on developing a software framework
for my trading system. For my trading strategy development, I make use
of a continuous systems development life cycle process from the
engineering realm. Starting from planning, to analysis, to design, to
implementation, to maintenance, and finally, back to planning, and so on
for each and every new concept that I have. (see <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/04/in-praise-of-failure/all/1">Sir James Dyson's
guest column on Wired</a>) Imagine that if you need to write a new
strategy file for each and every idea and for each of its design
iteration. Pretty soon you'll have many strategy files and a lot of
boilerplate codes. What if you found a bug or figured out some
enhancements to a particular component of your strategy? Then you'll
have to sift through all those files and make the changes to all those
relevant codes to make the update across the board. Hopefully, this
isn't the approach you're taking. Yet, a few trading API that I have
used before inherently encourage or even limit you (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">EasyLanguage and
MQL4</a>) to this archaic procedural programming paradigm. Luckily, Java
is an object-oriented programming language. However, it is only as
object-oriented as you make it to be. JForex, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/jforex">the trading API that I
use</a>, actually runs on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/more-trouble-with-jforex-iindicators/">the edge of breaking this
object-orientedness</a> as I have recently lamented. The bad news for the
beginning developer is that practically every published strategy which I
have seen or <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/source-code/">guilty of posting myself</a> are illustrations of what not
to do with software design. In that there's none in it whatsoever. Think
of common published strategies like the Ikea mini-model showrooms.
Everything is crammed into a tiny space but it is a simple way to convey
the gist of a room design (read: the trading algorithm). However, they
are not built for practical use. Real strategies are like suites in an
apartment building. There is an underlying architectural commonality for
easy management and maintenance while enabling diversity in the
strategies. My recently completed software framework dramatically made
my life easier in the tasks of implementation and maintenance. Software
maintenance, in particular, is most often needlessly and overly
complicated in trading strategy development because of the lack of a
good design. Because at the end of the day, most programmers spend the
majority of their time debugging, maintaining, and extending their code.
A true object-oriented design decouples all its components so that you
can use a divide and conquer approach with no repetition of work. Do you
have a development process in place? I'd like to hear how you tackle
this problem.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Yes, this is still Quantisan.com. In case anyone is visiting and noticed
the different design. I've made some major changes to the website over
the weekend for both aesthetic and technical reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Professionally designed.</strong> The previous theme was something that I
    hacked together over a weekend. It's actually pretty bad under the
    hood as I had only learned PHP scripting to write that theme. This
    new theme is a minor tweak over a professional framework. It enables
    more flexibility to the page layout. Expect some major changes to
    the front page in the weeks to come as this personal blog transforms
    into a company site.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced computing resource hog.</strong> I disabled a number of Wordpress
    plugin modules as the theme has already taken care of things like
    search engine optimisation.</li>
<li><strong>Optimised page loading time.</strong> The code for the new design is also
    optimised for faster page load times with built-in optimisation of
    javascript and css file loading.</li>
<li><strong>Geographically distributed content delivery network.</strong> As forex is
    a global endeavour, the readers to this blog is quite geographically
    diverse. While the site is hosted in the U.S., I want to ensure the
    readers from Germany and India (8% of my readers) have a smooth
    browsing experience too. The use of a CDN to mirror contents around
    the world makes this possible.</li>
<li><strong>Bad traffic filtering</strong>. A significant traffic on the web is due
    to software crawlers. Some of them post spam comments on my blog or
    copy my copyrighted materials. I added a server-side security
    control service to block all those unwanted traffic. This increases
    security and reduces unnecessary server load.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might have noticed that aside from point #1, which is purely
aesthetic, everything else is done to improve page load time for readers
to this blog. The result is that the new loading time is down to about
4.0 seconds. Whereas the old site took around 8 seconds to load. You
might think this cost a fortune. But it still costs less than most small
websites out there. The old site cost me \$30 <em>per year</em> to run,
including everything from domain name registration to web hosting. The
new total is still only up to \$70 <em>per year</em>. The key to the savings is
that I made use of a free network enhancement service
(<a href="http://www.cloudflare.com">cloudflare.com)</a> and exploited my remote server and network
optimisation knowledge acquired from the long nights of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/vps">administering a
remote trading server</a>. Technology is cheap nowadays. The real values
are in the ability to deliver on that technology to bring about even
greater return. This is what drives everything I do at Quantisan
Systems.</p>
