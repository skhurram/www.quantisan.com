            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My semi-automated trading system, Quantised Trading Desk, closed its
first trade this week. I was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-eurgbp-as-hedge-and-bearish-nzdusd-as-diversification/">bullish EURGBP</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-usdjpy-on-week-of-april-17-2011/">USDJPY</a>, and
bearish NZDUSD as per the previous discussions. The QTD system saved me
from the premature calls in both USDJPY and NZDUSD by not making any
trade this week. That, in and of itself, has made me very happy with
QTD's first week of live trading. Particular in light of how fierce that
USDJPY down move has been. As a bonus, QTD entered a long position in
EURGBP for a small 0.19% gain as illustrated below. My parameter were a
maximum of 0.25% risk per position. The gain could have been better if
it weren't for that 61% retracement. Not that I'm complaining as I
haven't even looked at the market this past couple of days while the
system is trading for me. USDJPY touched my threshold support price
80.70, my bullish sentiment needs to be reevaluated. NZDUSD just cracked
a higher high (marginally though), so I'm easing on the bear button for
now. EURGBP is testing some resistance to, so I'm not so eager to dive
in again. Overall, I've been 2/3 wrong. I've told you before that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-didnt-miss-a-boat-i-missed-a-freakin-rocket/">I'm
very bad at timing the market</a>. That's why I developed QTD to trade
for me. Seeing that it's a long weekend, and I'll be way from town, I'm
just going to shut down my remote trade server in London until next week
when I can have some time to re-do my analysis. [caption

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've had more time to study the market tonight and is running a second
and a third instances of Quantised Trading Desk (QTD) to trade 3
currencies in total simultaneously. For my dollar bull sentiment, I'm
dividing between USDJPY long and NZDUSD short. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-usdjpy-on-week-of-april-17-2011/">QTD still hasn't taken a
position in USDJPY in the past 24 hours</a>. That's a good thing as
USDJPY is still drifting downward today even as the dollar is gaining
some ground. My line in the sand is at 80.70 for USDJPY and above 0.8100
for NZDUSD. EURGBP long is a hedge against my dollar longs. Again, I'm
not making any trade at this point but merely <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/quantised-trading-desk/">setting up QTD to wait
for the right moments to enter</a>. A break below 0.8660 for EURGBP would
challenge my bullish bias. These three currencies should be my complete
market bias for a while. I'm just going to let QTD do its thing and
trade for me. Hopefully this will be the last you'll hear from me about
my market bias for a while. [caption id="attachment_5342"

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have unofficially launched my Quantised Trading Desk (QTD) expert
system this weekend as the system is ready for live trading after almost
a year in development. You can't miss the announcement if you visit the
new frontpage of this blog. So, I won't talk about it anymore here. The
purpose of this post is to discuss my forex trade. It's been over 7
months since I've traded on the forex market. I have been working on QTD
during all these months to improve my overall trading. Anyway, let's
dive right to it for my first trade back into forex. I am bullish on the
U.S. dollar this week. Why? The Financial Times is letting on <a href="">rumours
that the US Fed is signalling an end to quantitative easing</a>.
Coincidentally, the U.S. dollar appears to be testing supports across
all major currencies. Secondly the US equities market hasn't been able
to make higher highs even as the dollar is marking new lows. Still, I'm
not one to call a bottom, nor am I hunting for one. This is merely a
good risk-reward trade to gun for an obvious move. In particular, USDJPY
appears to be the best of the bunch as its been holding well over the
past few months while the dollar crumbled. The fact that Europe and US
are rumoured to be lighting up on the money printing whereas Japan's
money printing press is on full steam for the quake reconstruction (Yen
bearish) is a decent excuse to place some chips on USDJPY. You might
have noticed, I haven't specified my entry price, amount, or stop loss
price as usual. This is because I am relying on the Quantised Trading
Desk expert system to trade USDJPY for me. QTD will monitor the market
for me and execute trade entries and exits as it sees fit to accumulate
a long position in USDJPY. All the risk management and quant analysis
are built into the system. So I don't have a position yet because I'm
waiting for QTD to do the grunt work. [caption id="attachment_5332"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I spent a few months between 2010 and 2011 not on the market, not on
coming up with new strategies, but on developing a software framework
for my trading system. For my trading strategy development, I make use
of a continuous systems development life cycle process from the
engineering realm. Starting from planning, to analysis, to design, to
implementation, to maintenance, and finally, back to planning, and so on
for each and every new concept that I have. (see <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/04/in-praise-of-failure/all/1">Sir James Dyson's
guest column on Wired</a>) Imagine that if you need to write a new
strategy file for each and every idea and for each of its design
iteration. Pretty soon you'll have many strategy files and a lot of
boilerplate codes. What if you found a bug or figured out some
enhancements to a particular component of your strategy? Then you'll
have to sift through all those files and make the changes to all those
relevant codes to make the update across the board. Hopefully, this
isn't the approach you're taking. Yet, a few trading API that I have
used before inherently encourage or even limit you (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">EasyLanguage and
MQL4</a>) to this archaic procedural programming paradigm. Luckily, Java
is an object-oriented programming language. However, it is only as
object-oriented as you make it to be. JForex, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/jforex">the trading API that I
use</a>, actually runs on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/more-trouble-with-jforex-iindicators/">the edge of breaking this
object-orientedness</a> as I have recently lamented. The bad news for the
beginning developer is that practically every published strategy which I
have seen or <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/source-code/">guilty of posting myself</a> are illustrations of what not
to do with software design. In that there's none in it whatsoever. Think
of common published strategies like the Ikea mini-model showrooms.
Everything is crammed into a tiny space but it is a simple way to convey
the gist of a room design (read: the trading algorithm). However, they
are not built for practical use. Real strategies are like suites in an
apartment building. There is an underlying architectural commonality for
easy management and maintenance while enabling diversity in the
strategies. My recently completed software framework dramatically made
my life easier in the tasks of implementation and maintenance. Software
maintenance, in particular, is most often needlessly and overly
complicated in trading strategy development because of the lack of a
good design. Because at the end of the day, most programmers spend the
majority of their time debugging, maintaining, and extending their code.
A true object-oriented design decouples all its components so that you
can use a divide and conquer approach with no repetition of work. Do you
have a development process in place? I'd like to hear how you tackle
this problem.</p> </div>
