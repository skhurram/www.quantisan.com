            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been looking for a cheap but reliable virtual private server (VPS)
to run my trading program for the last few months. I ran my QTD program
on 3 remote servers in UK and Germany in April for an entire month as
performance testing. One in UK on a Xen cloud. One in Germany on OpenVZ.
And a last one also in UK on KVM technology. This post is a summary of
my initial findings on what to watch for when choosing a server provider
for running a remote trading server. Keep in mind that this is for
low-end, low-frequency, retail trading. Where latencies in the range of
tens of milliseconds are considered good. General target price range is
US\$10 - \$20 per month for an unmanaged server with 512MB of ram and
600MHz-equivalent of circa 2006 Intel CPU. Low price is the primary
consideration here. If you don't care for the technical details, the top
VPS names are <a href="http://www.linode.com">Linode</a>, <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en/">Hetzner</a>, and <a href="http://www.6sync.com">6sync</a> for Linux-based
VPSs. Linode offers Xen VPSs in US and UK. 6sync offers KVM VPSs in US
only. Both companies offer Linux-based 512MB instances for \$20 as a
starter server. Hetzner offers KVM VPSs in Germany for â‚¬7.90. Cloud
servers like Amazon EC2 and Rackspace Cloud are too expensive for
running 24/7.</p>
<h2>Location, Location, Location</h2>
<p>Use a datacenter that's at least in the same sub-continent as your
broker's datacenter. You wouldn't want your data to travel half-way
around the world just to save a few bucks. It adds unnecessary latency
and prices are comparable in either the states or Europe nowadays.
Although Asia is another story. If you use more than one broker, you can
use multiple servers or pick a server location that sits between them on
the internet backbone. TeleGeography provides <a href="http://www.telegeography.com/telecom-resources/map-gallery/index.html">global internet maps</a>
to identify best locations. I trade with Dukascopy and Oanda. One in
Switzerland and another in the states. As such, Internet hubs in cities
like New York, London, and Frankfurt are prime targets for low latency
between both brokers. As I trade more at Dukascopy, I'm biased to
European servers. Furthermore, London and Frankfurt are the #1 and #2
internet hub in the world. London has 7,723 Gbps and Frankfurt has 7,218
Gbps capacity in 2010. Whereas New York, 5th in the world, has 3,850
Gbps.</p>
<h2>Virtualization Technologies</h2>
<p>Virtual private servers are merely reserved resource chunks of a
computer in a datacenter. This is achieved through the use of
virtualization technologies. And there are quite many of those as I have
discovered. Here are three that you'll likely hear about in your search.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>OpenVZ.</strong> This is the most popular and least preferred platform
    for trading servers. It's often used by budget hosts because
    resources between virtualized instances are not well isolated. As
    such, a host can oversell a server's resource as most webapps have
    sporadic resource utilization trend. In other worlds, it is unlikely
    all the virtual private servers would demand their maximum allocated
    resources at the same time. However, trading servers require a
    consistent and guaranteed level of computing resource. So stay away
    from VPS that runs on OpenVZ unless you want to see server hiccups.</li>
<li><strong>Xen.</strong> This is what Amazon EC2 and Rackspace Cloud runs on. Xen
    offers true resource isolation so that you're less likely affected
    by your virtual server's neighbours. What you see is also what you
    get. So if you're promised 512MB of memory, you'll get 512MB of
    memory. However, processing power varies tremendously across
    different VPS providers. A micro instance on Amazon EC2 offers 613MB
    of memory, for example. But it is no match for even a 256MB instance
    on Rackspace Cloud. I was able to run a LXDE desktop GUI plus a java
    program on Rackspace but couldn't do it on Amazon.</li>
<li><strong>KVM.</strong> KVM uses the Linux kernel to virtualize. It's said to offer
    lower overhead to the host server so that it can provide better
    value than Xen. Like Xen, it offers true resource isolation.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, either Xen or KVM are good but stay away from OpenVZ.</p>
<h2>Operating System</h2>
<p>Key question here is: Linux or Windows? If you're unfamiliar with Linux
and is not interesting in learning about it, use a Windows Server 2003
or 2008 provider. Windows Server 2003 is preferred as it uses fewer
resources just to run so it's cheaper. Do note that Windows VPSs are
\$10-\$20 more expensive anyway because you have to pay for a monthly
license lease. With the use of a Windows-based VPS, you can connect to
your server through the remote desktop protocol (RDP). It's just a
matter of running the Remote Desktop application on your local machine
to your remote server. Then you'll see the remote machine's desktop on
your own machine. And then you can control the remote server just like
any other Windows computer. Very simple. However, I prefer to run Linux
because of its renowned stability and lower cost. The downside is that
you need to know what you're doing to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">tweak the server for trading</a>.
Linux uses very little computing resource to run. I can squeeze JForex
and Metatrader together on a Linux VPS with only 256MB memory. By
comparison, you need at least 512MB on a Windows box just to get the OS
running. And there's no licensing fee for Linux too. A double savings.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>When choosing a VPS provider, consider factors such as location,
virtualization technology, and operating system(s) offered. Once you've
narrowed your search to a shortlist of providers, the next step is to
compare their specific VPS offerings by looking at price, services, and
technical specifications.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My semi-automated trading system, Quantised Trading Desk, closed its
first trade this week. I was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-eurgbp-as-hedge-and-bearish-nzdusd-as-diversification/">bullish EURGBP</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-usdjpy-on-week-of-april-17-2011/">USDJPY</a>, and
bearish NZDUSD as per the previous discussions. The QTD system saved me
from the premature calls in both USDJPY and NZDUSD by not making any
trade this week. That, in and of itself, has made me very happy with
QTD's first week of live trading. Particular in light of how fierce that
USDJPY down move has been. As a bonus, QTD entered a long position in
EURGBP for a small 0.19% gain as illustrated below. My parameter were a
maximum of 0.25% risk per position. The gain could have been better if
it weren't for that 61% retracement. Not that I'm complaining as I
haven't even looked at the market this past couple of days while the
system is trading for me. USDJPY touched my threshold support price
80.70, my bullish sentiment needs to be reevaluated. NZDUSD just cracked
a higher high (marginally though), so I'm easing on the bear button for
now. EURGBP is testing some resistance to, so I'm not so eager to dive
in again. Overall, I've been 2/3 wrong. I've told you before that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-didnt-miss-a-boat-i-missed-a-freakin-rocket/">I'm
very bad at timing the market</a>. That's why I developed QTD to trade
for me. Seeing that it's a long weekend, and I'll be way from town, I'm
just going to shut down my remote trade server in London until next week
when I can have some time to re-do my analysis. [caption

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've had more time to study the market tonight and is running a second
and a third instances of Quantised Trading Desk (QTD) to trade 3
currencies in total simultaneously. For my dollar bull sentiment, I'm
dividing between USDJPY long and NZDUSD short. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-usdjpy-on-week-of-april-17-2011/">QTD still hasn't taken a
position in USDJPY in the past 24 hours</a>. That's a good thing as
USDJPY is still drifting downward today even as the dollar is gaining
some ground. My line in the sand is at 80.70 for USDJPY and above 0.8100
for NZDUSD. EURGBP long is a hedge against my dollar longs. Again, I'm
not making any trade at this point but merely <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/quantised-trading-desk/">setting up QTD to wait
for the right moments to enter</a>. A break below 0.8660 for EURGBP would
challenge my bullish bias. These three currencies should be my complete
market bias for a while. I'm just going to let QTD do its thing and
trade for me. Hopefully this will be the last you'll hear from me about
my market bias for a while. [caption id="attachment_5342"

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have unofficially launched my Quantised Trading Desk (QTD) expert
system this weekend as the system is ready for live trading after almost
a year in development. You can't miss the announcement if you visit the
new frontpage of this blog. So, I won't talk about it anymore here. The
purpose of this post is to discuss my forex trade. It's been over 7
months since I've traded on the forex market. I have been working on QTD
during all these months to improve my overall trading. Anyway, let's
dive right to it for my first trade back into forex. I am bullish on the
U.S. dollar this week. Why? The Financial Times is letting on <a href="">rumours
that the US Fed is signalling an end to quantitative easing</a>.
Coincidentally, the U.S. dollar appears to be testing supports across
all major currencies. Secondly the US equities market hasn't been able
to make higher highs even as the dollar is marking new lows. Still, I'm
not one to call a bottom, nor am I hunting for one. This is merely a
good risk-reward trade to gun for an obvious move. In particular, USDJPY
appears to be the best of the bunch as its been holding well over the
past few months while the dollar crumbled. The fact that Europe and US
are rumoured to be lighting up on the money printing whereas Japan's
money printing press is on full steam for the quake reconstruction (Yen
bearish) is a decent excuse to place some chips on USDJPY. You might
have noticed, I haven't specified my entry price, amount, or stop loss
price as usual. This is because I am relying on the Quantised Trading
Desk expert system to trade USDJPY for me. QTD will monitor the market
for me and execute trade entries and exits as it sees fit to accumulate
a long position in USDJPY. All the risk management and quant analysis
are built into the system. So I don't have a position yet because I'm
waiting for QTD to do the grunt work. [caption id="attachment_5332"
