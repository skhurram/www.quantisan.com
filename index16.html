            <div class="article-content"> <p>Early in 2010, I discussed about my plan to [grow my trading accounts
organically and eventually trade for a living][] (i.e. live and breath
in the market 24/7). Now that the first whole year of my long term plan
has passed, I can update my visualization table as shown. <img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2011-01-14-monetarygoal.png" /> 2010 was
a good year. My starting capital for 2011 is 63% more than expected.
This is mostly due to the \$13,000 prize money from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">winning six of nine
Dukascopy automated trading contests</a>. On the contrary to my
fortuitous success, I revised some of my estimations noted in the table
to be even more conservative. In particular, I reduced my annual deposit
to reflect real bookkeeping data in 2010 and lowered my investment yield
expectation based on my performance data throughout the past 10 years of
my trading. To mitigate these reductions, I expect to continue
depositing funds while I receive a salaried income rather than stop
mid-way as originally proposed. The effect of inflation is deliberately
ignored in this table because I'm discounting its effect in my
investment yield estimate rather than adding more columns. It's all
guess work for now anyway. Nineteen years is indeed a long time. It is a
<em>worst case scenario</em> assuming that I will grow my accounts organically
and not do anything else. I doubt I will need that much time as there
are means other than trading a personal account to achieve trading for a
living. I might discuss more about this later in the year once something
materialize. My focus this year is to finish developing my proprietary
Java trading platform with my partner and put it to good use in the
forex market. Nineteen years or not, the fact that trading for a living
is even possible for a self-taught amateur such as myself is testament
to these incredible times that we're living in. I fully intend to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-sign-that-you-are-truly-enjoying-what-you-do/">enjoy
every second of it</a>.</p>

I was just organizing my bookshelf the other day and is surprised by how
fast my collection of statistics books have grown. I studied statistics
back in school as a stepping stone to learning stochastic process for
wireless communication theories (e.g. CDMA). Detecting radio-frequency
and resolving wireless signals to meaningful messages is fundamentally
about assessing the state of random processes. I hated statistics back
then because I didn't *get it* and did poorly in those courses. It is
ironic that years later I would realize how much I have grown to rely
and love the little *p*'s and *q*'s in my little hobby of quantitative
trading. I still don't like statistics (or theoretical math), per se. I
just love *applying* them in my trading and quant programs. The more
that I learn about statistics, the more that I realize how powerful they
can be and how ignorant I am. For example, in my clinical study days I
used either t-test or ANOVA for everything under the sun. Now that I've
come to understanding about inferential statistics, I am aware of the
assumptions and pitfalls such as the assumption of t-tests of
homogeneity of variance between the two samples tested. If this
assumption is violated, then the unequal variance t-test should be used.
Finer points like these are routinely ignored in practice because many
clinical studies are inherently designed in the experiment to meet these
criteria. However, that's not the case when I am making creative use of
statistics in my trading. I don't have a clinical study committee
watching over my back. If I make a false or weaker-than-expected claim
and don't know better, then it is my bank account that will suffer the
consequences. Learning statistics was initially due to this
got-to-know-better necessity. However, the more that I learn about
statistics, the more that I appreciate it. If used correctly, statistics
can provide a new dimension to the scientific assessment of your trading
performance and market data.

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I pondered over this issue over the holiday as I'm finding myself
juggling too many tasks. I was participating in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-trading-contest-from-dukascopy/">two trading
contests</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">developing an automated trading system</a> with a team,
managing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">an open-source project</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/stocks/">actively trading</a>, and writing
this blog, all on top of a full time job. I got greedy in what I wanted
to accomplish and it is negatively affecting my performance. The first
symptom popped up in my trading, not surprisingly. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/story-of-a-bad-trade-and-a-missed-opportunity/">made a bad call
and missed a long-awaited opportunity</a>. This was a wakeup call as the
performance statistics from my recent trades is showing statistically
significant deviations (I will publish the data soon). So before
anything gets out of hand, I've decided to manage my time more
professionally rather than just do what needs to be done. Taking a page
from my professional work, I will prioritize my trading and development
work using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method">Eisenhower Method</a>. Basically, I mentally stamp an
importance and urgentness ranking to each of my tasks. Then I will work
on the important and urgent tasks first and leave the rest til later in
order of the ranking criteria. For example, the automated contest is
important and urgent because I've won over USD\$10,000 in 2010 and
there's a monthly deadline for it. So I work on it first if there's work
to do, which isn't much. The <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/tradercontest/?action=blog&amp;trader=Quantisan">manual trading contest</a>, on the other
hand, is urgent but not so important. If I were to participate in it
seriously, I would need to allocate an hour or so each night to trade.
This is time that I would rather spend working on other stuff. On the
other end of the importance/urgentness spectrum is my equities trading.
I am rating it as an unimportant and non-urgent task. Although I've
written the most about it and that my account has been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">up 21% in
2010</a>, it takes a lot of my time and the absoluate return is small.
That is because my equities account is the smallest of my various
trading accounts. So 21% profit of a small account is still very small.
Thus, this account isn't worth devoting too much time for now. My plan
is to use a beta strategy for my equities account. I already have some
ideas on what to do with it. This will be discussed in another post.
Ultimately, here's an excerpt of my priority list:</p>
<ol>
<li>trading system development</li>
<li>automated trading contest</li>
<li>quant research</li>
<li>documentation and blog posting</li>
<li>trading strategy R&amp;D</li>
<li>manual trading contest</li>
<li>equities trading</li>
</ol>
<p>What this means to you as a reader is that there will be fewer charts
and more technical discussion. My goal for 2011 is to post something at
least once a week. This is a good time to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/feed/">subscribe to my RSS feed</a>
to have new posts delivered to you rather than having to keep checking
here for updates.</p>
