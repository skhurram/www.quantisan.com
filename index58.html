            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The rise in popularity of social sites for trading has paved the way for
ever more unscrupulous trading system sellers to spread their high yield
scams. Just to be clear, I am not against websites such as <a href="http://www.myfxbook.com">Myfxbook</a>
and <a href="http://www.covestor.com">Covestor</a>, nor against trading system sellers in general.
However, there are always bad apples in a basket. And there are many bad
apples out there. Trading social sites typically nurture a community of
traders by enforcing <strong>transparent</strong> and <strong>audited</strong> trading history.
Unfortunately, it is because of this claim, people are enticed by
trading systems showing unbelievable high yields of 200%, 400%, 800%, or
even more in mere weeks on sites such as Myfxbook or Covestor. But if
the history of every trade taken is published and the account is
verified, doesn't that mean that they are just really that good? First
of all, if these people can double or triple their accounts in a few
weeks or months as they claim, why the heck are they selling their
system to you for a few hundred bucks and lose their monopoly?! If you
have a Lamborghini in your garage, do you rent it out for a few hundred
bucks to total strangers? Common sense should be on red alert. For sake
of argument, let's say that you give them the benefit of the doubt. All
is not as simple as it seems though. Here is one old trick in the book
scammers may use to game a transparent and audited trade history. I will
use <a href="http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Pheniox/sir-lancelot/1806">one of the top performers currently on Myfxbook</a> to illustrate
how their scam work. And surprise, surprise, this particular system is
on sale for a limited time (will see why later) for only US\$365. Figure
1 is the account percentage growth graph of this particular system. 488%
gain in 4 months!</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Account growth
chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_balancecurve.png" />][][/caption] Let's take a look at the trading performance
statistics. Remember, these are <strong>real, audited numbers</strong>.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Trade
performance statistics"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradestats.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradestats.png">1</a>[/caption] Aside from the impressive
90% success rate (something <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-goldman-sachs-robbed-you-and-me-of-3-billions-in-3-months/">only Goldman Sachs can achieve</a>
consistently), the rest of the numbers actually look quite normal.
Notice that their average pips won and lost are both around 13 pips. So
this is supposedly a short-term scalping strategy to catch small but
high probability moves. Which does exist in real life, as you know. Then
as if you're not convinced of their awesomeness yet, here's a snapshot
of some recent trade history.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Trade
history"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradehist.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradehist.png">2</a>[/caption] This is where you might start to raise
some eyebrows. Observe that 5 out of 8 trades shown are minuscule gains
but they have <strong>no stop loss</strong> in place! That's not a problem, per se.
Some systems don't use an open stop order. However, notice the open and
closing time. These suspicious trades were held for almost a day! That's
like an eternity for a scalping system. Who knows how much drawdown have
occurred in the account during those hours! Actually, we do, take a look
at the figure below for an open order of this system.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Open
trade"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_opentrades.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_opentrades.png">3</a>[/caption] Caught red-handed! The open order shows a
gigantic loss running. See the -\$9290 loss being held? That's about a
third of their current balance of \$29k! But here's the trick. What the
system does is wait for market noise to swing the price back to
breakeven and then close the trade for a +1 pip. As the trade isn't
closed at the moment, this humongous drawdown doesn't count as a loss
and is nowhere to be seen in the trading history. That is what happens
with many of those unusually small pips but long-held trades as
discussed above. In effect, they are risking their entire account
balance on just a few pips of profit on every trade. The reason why many
of these unbelieveable systems typically have a trade history of only a
few months at most? That isn't just for show. Sooner or later, their
luck runs out with this no-stop rule and the market will have them choke
down those monstrous losses. Eventually, their account just blows up.
But at that point, they can make a switch-aroo and pull up another
trading history that hasn't blown up yet to replace this one that just
failed. Then it's business as usual. What's more amusing is thatsomeone
asked this question of why there is a huge drawdown in another huge
drawdown open trade months ago. The response from the author is that it
was just a careless programming mistake. Imagine, here they are selling
a massively "profitable" system on one hand and then claiming a glitch
on another. In summary, <strong>the key to a statistically 100% winning
system</strong> is simple. Follow the trend with no stop and only close a trade
with a positive gain. But as I've explained the fallacies with this
approach above, <strong>never try that with your money</strong> as you are risking
all for so little! For general advice on avoiding forex scams, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex_scam">Wikipedia entry</a> offers an overview and ForexCrunch has a good
article on <a href="http://www.forexcrunch.com/forex-scams-7-ways-to-avoid-them/">7 Ways to Avoid Forex Scams</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I haven't done one of these <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/entry/">trade analysis post</a> for weeks. So I
thought I'll start the year on this promising long term (more than a
week) trade on one of my favourite currency pairs, AUD/JPY. This entry
on shorting AUD/JPY is executed according to my Forex Trend Reversal
(FTR) setup. Figure 1 shows the weekly chart. Please excuse the mess.
There are only 3 relevant lines in addition to the price. Referring to
Figure 1, first line of note is the top of that 4-line descending
channel. Notice that 84.50 correspond with the resistance this week.
Secondly, there are 3 ascending trendlines drawn. We have a triple
X-cross on the 2 ascending and 1 descending lines at around 85.00 last
week. AUD/JPY failed to touch it. If this trade goes well, AUD/JPY
shouldn't test 85.00 again because it has missed its chance. That's
where I placed my stop. Anyway, these are just doodles on a chart, we
need confirmations. For that, let's take a look at the major Aussie
crosses and gold prices in Figure 2. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"
width="580" caption="AUD/JPY, weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-04-AUDJPY.png" />][][/caption] [caption id=""

the 4-hour charts of Figure 2. From top to bottom, Figure 2 shows
AUD/USD, EUR/AUD, AUD/JPY, and GC (gold futures). We also see that gold
prices is staying at a depressed level below 1120. This rising Aussie
but toppy gold price is a sign of divergence. Furthermore, we have a
shooting star candlestick pattern in the previous gold price bar. Gold
spiked above 1130 briefly but couldn't hold above 1120 so far. Another
plus for the short. Now that the entry signals have been met. I needed
to time my entry. This the the part that I should have done better. I
basically just shorted it at the '50 resistance without giving it much
thought. The short-term bullishness is still strong and I really should
have waited for a lower high on the 3-hour chart. Figures 3 and 4 are
the daily and 3-hour charts, respectively.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUD/JPY,

smallish position in this trade at an obvious resistance level. My
intention is to add to it as long as AUD/JPY stay below 85. Also, a
safer stop should be 85.50 as seen from Figure 3 (daily). 84.40 was a
recent top in October. Lastly, I chose to short AUD/JPY instead of
AUD/USD because I have some other U.S. dollar longs already.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/november-2009-trading-performance-review/">set 2 goals back in November</a> for December. 1) Think more,
trade less; and 2) Be more aggressive on winners. With 276 trades in
December, I have failed miserably for goal #1. I couldn't meet my
second goal either as I've missed most of the big moves from failing to
recognize the bigger picture. Nonetheless, I ended up the month +2.71%
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">in my demo account</a> by picking pennies here and there and with the
help of some<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">decent risk management</a> to limit my risks. Overall, it
was a bad month for me because of too much time spent trading with
little reward to show. I noticed my over-trading tendency early in the
month. My solution was to [limit myself to the longer timeframe to
reduce moving in and out of trades][] too frequently. Reviewing that
particular post, I was spot on with identifying my problem. However, my
over-trading problem lingered on for the rest of the month (i.e.
"staring at the trading screen too much once I am in a position and
tried to micro-manage my trades to minimize my risk"). While this can be
attributed to the more volatile market in December (discussed later),
the real downside of my over-trading can be seen in Figure 1 showing my
demo account balance graph for December.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="December 2009
Account Balance"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/december_2009_account_balance.png" />][][/caption] Notice the following
characteristics in Figure 1.</p>
<ol>
<li>two up-spikes in the month (around the 8th and 17th)</li>
<li>a slow, barely-upward grind in the middle of the month (from 9th to
    16th)</li>
<li>a marching drawdown at the start and end</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 was mostly luck. I was in the right position at the right time. #2
was the grind as it should be. I intend to delegate this type of trading
to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading system</a> once it's developed (haven't even
started yet though). But for the moment, it's all manual. What's most
concerning is #3. Sometimes it's just better to not trade at all. That
is something which I still need to learn to do. Evidently, I still need
to work on narrowing my trading setup to filter out these erroneous
trades. I outlined the new steps for that [in my previous post][limit
myself to the longer timeframe to reduce moving in and out of trades]
already. I just need discipline to follow my own advice.</p>
<h2>Performance Statistics</h2>
<p><strong>Monthly Metric December (November)</strong> Sarting Fund \$5,469.11 End of
Month Fund \$5,617.44 Total Net Profit \$148.33 (\$166.90) Gross Profit
\$591 (\$598) Gross Loss -\$443 (-\$431) Profit Factor 1.34 (1.39) Net
Profit % 2.71% (3.15%) Max. Drawdown % 1.91% (3.44%) The above stats
look consistent with the previous month's data in brackets. My maximum
drawdown actually improved significantly down to 1.91% from 3.44%. That
is due to the fact that I took a lot more small trades to rake in
pennies rather than bet big on big moves. Frankly, I would prefer the
latter strategy as I don't typically have so much time. Sterling Ratio
0.41 (0.41) Excess Return 2.66% (3.10%) SDev Return per Trade 0.12%
(0.19%) Kurtosis 17.38 (3.45) Skewness 3.30 (1.54) Comparing my
performance statistics using <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/">my new modified Sterling ratio</a>, it's
coincidentally exactly the same as November. My maximum drawdown
improved but its benefit in the equation is cancelled out by the
increased volatility in December. My ultimate target is to achieve a
consistent monthly modified Sterling Ratio of 0.50 or above. The
kurtosis and skewness statistics got a lot worse this month. These are
expected from the large number of small trades and the few big
profitable trades as seen in Figure 1. However, what's alarming is the
data below. 95th Percentile P&amp;L \$11.97 (\$23.20) 5th Percentile P&amp;L
-\$5.73 (-\$10.31) Net Profit Mid 90% Only -\$46.96 (\$33.82) As you can
see, it would have been a losing month if it weren't for the outlier
trades. This is definitely the most worrisome statistic this month. <strong>I
need to stop picking pennies and concentrate on bigger moves.</strong> Total #
of Trades 276 (153) Percent Profitable 40.77% (46.36%) # of Winning
Trades 95 (70) # of Losing Trades 138 (81) # of Break-even Trades 43
(2) As I've said before, I took the most number of trades this month
since my short forex career. My percent profitable drifted farther below
50% to 40.77%. I might as well throw random dart to make my pick. This
has once again proven that I over-traded and didn't spent enough time
with my analysis. The large number of break-even trades is also a
sore-sight in the data. Average Trade Profit % 0.01% (0.02%) Average
Winning % 0.11% (0.16%) Average Losing % -0.06% (-0.10%) Ratio Win% /

<h2>Goal for January</h2>
<p>There's only one goal for me for January and it's the same as
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/november-2009-trading-performance-review/">November</a>'s. <strong>Think more and trade
less</strong>! Refer to my post on <a href="../focusing-on-trading-my-timeframe-to-reduce-over-trading/" title="Permanent Link to Focusing on trading my timeframe to reduce over-trading">Focusing on trading my timeframe to reduce

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
In my previous post, I discussed about [3 reasons why I don't use
Jensen's alpha or Sharpe ratio for my montly trading performance
measurement][]. In this post, I will talk about what I actually use and
how I came up with it. As I was saying in the previous post, what one
chooses to use as their performance metric depend on 3 factors such as
your style of trading, your agenda, and your interest in this topic. I
will briefly lay out my 3 motives as background information. I use a
swing trading strategy for trading forex. I aim to hold for at least a
few hours to a few days. I am working to hold longer and trade less in
the future, but that's another story. To fit my style of trading, a
performance metric has to be unbiased for long and short trades as well
as taking into account short term conditions in the market. In terms of
agenda, what is the purpose of my performance metric? As a part-time
trader, I answer only to myself. These numbers are used for my
self-improvement and internal month-to-month comparisons only. Lastly,
my interest in this topic of portfolio measurement is limited. I want
something easy to calculate and simple to understand. I have read a few
academic papers on this topic and spent a few hours researching on the
web. That's about it. Now that my motives have been laid out, let's
discuss my process for coming up with my trading performance metric.
Ultimately, my assessment on how well I have done for the month is to
measure my return based on the risk taken. In other words, Performance
Metric = Reward / Risk. My Reward function is simple. I just steal the
idea from Sharpe and use:

> Reward = Net Return - Riskless Return

Shameless. I know. I don't want to muck with the Reward function because
at the end of the day, it is your account balance that matters. The Risk
function takes some more thought. On a trade-by-trade basis, the risk
taken for a particular trade can be thought of as the stop loss. It is a
amount put at risk to be taken by the market. In other words, risk can
be represented by the loss you are willing to take. On a month-to-month
basis, the most important loss value that I pay attention to is my
maximum drawdown. A drawdown imposes a real dent in your account as well
as negatively impact your trading psychology. For these reasons, the
maximum drawdown is a variable in my Risk function.

> Risk = Max. Drawdown ...

However, I am not done yet. While max. drawdown is important, it is an
entirely internal factor. The risk you take is also affected by the
condition of the market. Using the stop loss analogy again, a 50 pips
stop loss can be labelled as both conservative and aggressive risk
exposure depending on the volatility of the market in the timeframe
you're trading. As such, we need to consider volatility in the Risk
function. However, this raises another question, what is volatility.
Long story short, I just snatch the Average True Range (ATR) indicator
that I use on my charts in this formula. However, we can't just stick a
ATR value in because it's an absolute number. We need to use a
percentage ATR (%ATR) to correspond with all the other percentage
numbers in the formula. And since this is for monthly analysis, I grab
the %ATR from a monthly chart. In particular, I use the monthly %ATR on
the U.S. dollar futures chart. Finally, the Risk function is:

> Risk = Maximum Drawdown + %ATR

Thus,

> **Performance Metric = (Net Return - Riskless Return) / (Maximum
> Drawdown + %ATR)**

As an example, here are the values I plug in for each variable to
calculate my performance metric for [November][]. Net Return = 3.15%,
read from November's statement Riskless Return = 0.54% (per annum) / 12
= 0.045%. This is the Canadian 1-year treasury rate in November. Max.
Drawdown = 3.55%, read from November's statement %ATR = monthly ATR(3)
of U.S. dollar futures / monthly close of U.S. dollar futures =
3.1473/74.895. To verify the efficacy of this performance metric. Let's
do a mental check of my criteria as discussed.

1.  Unbiased for long and short trades? Yes, it uses the net return
    regardless of which side you took.
2.  Varies with short term market conditions? Yes, from the %ATR.
3.  Comparable between month to month? Yes, the number is normalized by
    market volatility each month.
4.  Easy to calculate? Yes, it's can be done in my [trade log][]
    spreadsheet with a few formulas.
5.  Easy to understand? Yes, it's an interpretation of reward / risk.

As with any other attempt to summarize trading performance into one
single value, many assumptions have been taken. I cherry picked what I
needed to assemble a formula. Some observant reader will notice that
this formula is similar to the Sterling and Calmar ratios. Indeed, this
is yet another modified form of these ratios. In fact, I will be
referring to this formula as Sterling ratio in my future posts for
simplicity.
