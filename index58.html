            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I haven't done one of these <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/entry/">trade analysis post</a> for weeks. So I
thought I'll start the year on this promising long term (more than a
week) trade on one of my favourite currency pairs, AUD/JPY. This entry
on shorting AUD/JPY is executed according to my Forex Trend Reversal
(FTR) setup. Figure 1 shows the weekly chart. Please excuse the mess.
There are only 3 relevant lines in addition to the price. Referring to
Figure 1, first line of note is the top of that 4-line descending
channel. Notice that 84.50 correspond with the resistance this week.
Secondly, there are 3 ascending trendlines drawn. We have a triple
X-cross on the 2 ascending and 1 descending lines at around 85.00 last
week. AUD/JPY failed to touch it. If this trade goes well, AUD/JPY
shouldn't test 85.00 again because it has missed its chance. That's
where I placed my stop. Anyway, these are just doodles on a chart, we
need confirmations. For that, let's take a look at the major Aussie
crosses and gold prices in Figure 2. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

the 4-hour charts of Figure 2. From top to bottom, Figure 2 shows
AUD/USD, EUR/AUD, AUD/JPY, and GC (gold futures). We also see that gold
prices is staying at a depressed level below 1120. This rising Aussie
but toppy gold price is a sign of divergence. Furthermore, we have a
shooting star candlestick pattern in the previous gold price bar. Gold
spiked above 1130 briefly but couldn't hold above 1120 so far. Another
plus for the short. Now that the entry signals have been met. I needed
to time my entry. This the the part that I should have done better. I
basically just shorted it at the '50 resistance without giving it much
thought. The short-term bullishness is still strong and I really should
have waited for a lower high on the 3-hour chart. Figures 3 and 4 are
the daily and 3-hour charts, respectively.</p>

smallish position in this trade at an obvious resistance level. My
intention is to add to it as long as AUD/JPY stay below 85. Also, a
safer stop should be 85.50 as seen from Figure 3 (daily). 84.40 was a
recent top in October. Lastly, I chose to short AUD/JPY instead of
AUD/USD because I have some other U.S. dollar longs already.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/november-2009-trading-performance-review/">set 2 goals back in November</a> for December. 1) Think more,
trade less; and 2) Be more aggressive on winners. With 276 trades in
December, I have failed miserably for goal #1. I couldn't meet my
second goal either as I've missed most of the big moves from failing to
recognize the bigger picture. Nonetheless, I ended up the month +2.71%
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">in my demo account</a> by picking pennies here and there and with the
help of some<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">decent risk management</a> to limit my risks. Overall, it
was a bad month for me because of too much time spent trading with
little reward to show. I noticed my over-trading tendency early in the
month. My solution was to [limit myself to the longer timeframe to
reduce moving in and out of trades][] too frequently. Reviewing that
particular post, I was spot on with identifying my problem. However, my
over-trading problem lingered on for the rest of the month (i.e.
"staring at the trading screen too much once I am in a position and
tried to micro-manage my trades to minimize my risk"). While this can be
attributed to the more volatile market in December (discussed later),
the real downside of my over-trading can be seen in Figure 1 showing my
demo account balance graph for December.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="December 2009
Account Balance"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/december_2009_account_balance.png" />][][/caption] Notice the following
characteristics in Figure 1.</p>
<ol>
<li>two up-spikes in the month (around the 8th and 17th)</li>
<li>a slow, barely-upward grind in the middle of the month (from 9th to
    16th)</li>
<li>a marching drawdown at the start and end</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 was mostly luck. I was in the right position at the right time. #2
was the grind as it should be. I intend to delegate this type of trading
to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading system</a> once it's developed (haven't even
started yet though). But for the moment, it's all manual. What's most
concerning is #3. Sometimes it's just better to not trade at all. That
is something which I still need to learn to do. Evidently, I still need
to work on narrowing my trading setup to filter out these erroneous
trades. I outlined the new steps for that [in my previous post][limit
myself to the longer timeframe to reduce moving in and out of trades]
already. I just need discipline to follow my own advice.</p>
<h2>Performance Statistics</h2>
<p><strong>Monthly Metric December (November)</strong> Sarting Fund \$5,469.11 End of
Month Fund \$5,617.44 Total Net Profit \$148.33 (\$166.90) Gross Profit
\$591 (\$598) Gross Loss -\$443 (-\$431) Profit Factor 1.34 (1.39) Net
Profit % 2.71% (3.15%) Max. Drawdown % 1.91% (3.44%) The above stats
look consistent with the previous month's data in brackets. My maximum
drawdown actually improved significantly down to 1.91% from 3.44%. That
is due to the fact that I took a lot more small trades to rake in
pennies rather than bet big on big moves. Frankly, I would prefer the
latter strategy as I don't typically have so much time. Sterling Ratio
0.41 (0.41) Excess Return 2.66% (3.10%) SDev Return per Trade 0.12%
(0.19%) Kurtosis 17.38 (3.45) Skewness 3.30 (1.54) Comparing my
performance statistics using <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/">my new modified Sterling ratio</a>, it's
coincidentally exactly the same as November. My maximum drawdown
improved but its benefit in the equation is cancelled out by the
increased volatility in December. My ultimate target is to achieve a
consistent monthly modified Sterling Ratio of 0.50 or above. The
kurtosis and skewness statistics got a lot worse this month. These are
expected from the large number of small trades and the few big
profitable trades as seen in Figure 1. However, what's alarming is the
data below. 95th Percentile P&amp;L \$11.97 (\$23.20) 5th Percentile P&amp;L
-\$5.73 (-\$10.31) Net Profit Mid 90% Only -\$46.96 (\$33.82) As you can
see, it would have been a losing month if it weren't for the outlier
trades. This is definitely the most worrisome statistic this month. <strong>I
need to stop picking pennies and concentrate on bigger moves.</strong> Total #
of Trades 276 (153) Percent Profitable 40.77% (46.36%) # of Winning
Trades 95 (70) # of Losing Trades 138 (81) # of Break-even Trades 43
(2) As I've said before, I took the most number of trades this month
since my short forex career. My percent profitable drifted farther below
50% to 40.77%. I might as well throw random dart to make my pick. This
has once again proven that I over-traded and didn't spent enough time
with my analysis. The large number of break-even trades is also a
sore-sight in the data. Average Trade Profit % 0.01% (0.02%) Average
Winning % 0.11% (0.16%) Average Losing % -0.06% (-0.10%) Ratio Win% /

<h2>Goal for January</h2>
<p>There's only one goal for me for January and it's the same as
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/november-2009-trading-performance-review/">November</a>'s. <strong>Think more and trade
less</strong>! Refer to my post on <a href="../focusing-on-trading-my-timeframe-to-reduce-over-trading/" title="Permanent Link to Focusing on trading my timeframe to reduce over-trading">Focusing on trading my timeframe to reduce

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
In my previous post, I discussed about [3 reasons why I don't use
Jensen's alpha or Sharpe ratio for my montly trading performance
measurement][]. In this post, I will talk about what I actually use and
how I came up with it. As I was saying in the previous post, what one
chooses to use as their performance metric depend on 3 factors such as
your style of trading, your agenda, and your interest in this topic. I
will briefly lay out my 3 motives as background information. I use a
swing trading strategy for trading forex. I aim to hold for at least a
few hours to a few days. I am working to hold longer and trade less in
the future, but that's another story. To fit my style of trading, a
performance metric has to be unbiased for long and short trades as well
as taking into account short term conditions in the market. In terms of
agenda, what is the purpose of my performance metric? As a part-time
trader, I answer only to myself. These numbers are used for my
self-improvement and internal month-to-month comparisons only. Lastly,
my interest in this topic of portfolio measurement is limited. I want
something easy to calculate and simple to understand. I have read a few
academic papers on this topic and spent a few hours researching on the
web. That's about it. Now that my motives have been laid out, let's
discuss my process for coming up with my trading performance metric.
Ultimately, my assessment on how well I have done for the month is to
measure my return based on the risk taken. In other words, Performance
Metric = Reward / Risk. My Reward function is simple. I just steal the
idea from Sharpe and use:

> Reward = Net Return - Riskless Return

Shameless. I know. I don't want to muck with the Reward function because
at the end of the day, it is your account balance that matters. The Risk
function takes some more thought. On a trade-by-trade basis, the risk
taken for a particular trade can be thought of as the stop loss. It is a
amount put at risk to be taken by the market. In other words, risk can
be represented by the loss you are willing to take. On a month-to-month
basis, the most important loss value that I pay attention to is my
maximum drawdown. A drawdown imposes a real dent in your account as well
as negatively impact your trading psychology. For these reasons, the
maximum drawdown is a variable in my Risk function.

> Risk = Max. Drawdown ...

However, I am not done yet. While max. drawdown is important, it is an
entirely internal factor. The risk you take is also affected by the
condition of the market. Using the stop loss analogy again, a 50 pips
stop loss can be labelled as both conservative and aggressive risk
exposure depending on the volatility of the market in the timeframe
you're trading. As such, we need to consider volatility in the Risk
function. However, this raises another question, what is volatility.
Long story short, I just snatch the Average True Range (ATR) indicator
that I use on my charts in this formula. However, we can't just stick a
ATR value in because it's an absolute number. We need to use a
percentage ATR (%ATR) to correspond with all the other percentage
numbers in the formula. And since this is for monthly analysis, I grab
the %ATR from a monthly chart. In particular, I use the monthly %ATR on
the U.S. dollar futures chart. Finally, the Risk function is:

> Risk = Maximum Drawdown + %ATR

Thus,

> **Performance Metric = (Net Return - Riskless Return) / (Maximum
> Drawdown + %ATR)**

As an example, here are the values I plug in for each variable to
calculate my performance metric for [November][]. Net Return = 3.15%,
read from November's statement Riskless Return = 0.54% (per annum) / 12
= 0.045%. This is the Canadian 1-year treasury rate in November. Max.
Drawdown = 3.55%, read from November's statement %ATR = monthly ATR(3)
of U.S. dollar futures / monthly close of U.S. dollar futures =
3.1473/74.895. To verify the efficacy of this performance metric. Let's
do a mental check of my criteria as discussed.

1.  Unbiased for long and short trades? Yes, it uses the net return
    regardless of which side you took.
2.  Varies with short term market conditions? Yes, from the %ATR.
3.  Comparable between month to month? Yes, the number is normalized by
    market volatility each month.
4.  Easy to calculate? Yes, it's can be done in my [trade log][]
    spreadsheet with a few formulas.
5.  Easy to understand? Yes, it's an interpretation of reward / risk.

As with any other attempt to summarize trading performance into one
single value, many assumptions have been taken. I cherry picked what I
needed to assemble a formula. Some observant reader will notice that
this formula is similar to the Sterling and Calmar ratios. Indeed, this
is yet another modified form of these ratios. In fact, I will be
referring to this formula as Sterling ratio in my future posts for
simplicity.

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As a part-time trader, measuring my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/monthly-review.html">monthly trading performance</a> can
be as simple or as complex as it can be. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being
just reading the percent return from the account statement and 10 being
running a statistical analysis, my preferred trading performance
measurement method is a simple 3. I am lazy but want a metric that is
useful for monthly self-evaluation. That is why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_alpha">Jensen's alpha</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio">Sharpe ratio</a> have appealed to me. Both of these ratios are can be
easily derived. However, 3 shortcomings of these metrics made me decide
not to use them for my forex trading. First is the fact that they
emphasize <em>excess return</em> with respective of the market. It makes sense
to compare a portfolio with the overall market on a long term basis. But
what if you want to do month-by-month, or even week-by-week analysis?
Short-term market volatility could skew your performance metric up/down
even when you have been performing consistently. Furthermore, what if it
is an out-right bear market? Your short-side strategy would be boosted
by the negative return of the market. For a swing trader such as myself,
a shorter time-frame and long/short unbiased measurements are
non-trivial matters for analysing trading performance. Secondly, neither
metrics factor in volatility of a market. A 5% return in a calm market
is not the same as 5% in a volatile market. If you go out to fish in a
storm, you'd better expect a huge payout to compensate for the extra
risk. Lastly, I don't like their definition of risk. For me, a
short-term performance ratio can sufficiently be characterized as reward
/ risk. Jensen's alpha calculation has no explicit measurement of risk
at all. Whereas Sharpe takes the standard deviation of the portfolio's
return as the risk value. For a monthly analysis, I would have to use a
daily or weekly drawdown to calculate the standard deviation. The
problem with using the daily is that it's too much work for me to do
manually on my spreadsheet. As for the weekly, having just 4 weeks in a
month <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_size">is not a sufficient sampling size</a> to calculate a
representative standard deviation. In summary, here are my 3 reasons for
not using Jensen's alpha and Sharpe ratio.</p>
<ol>
<li>Emphasis on excess return with respect to the market</li>
<li>No consideration for volatility of the market</li>
<li>Not agreeing on their definition of risk</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, there are numerous reasons why these metrics are the
standard portfolio measurments used by many traders. Heck, Jensen's
alpha and Sharpe ratio have been around for 40 years and are still
widely in use today. However, they are just not suitable for me as
discussed. The thing is, there are countless number of new and old
portfolio measurements out there. What one chooses to use depend on
various factors such as your style of trading, your agenda, and your
interest in this topic. In my next post, I will introduce the metric
that I use for my monthly trading performance analysis -- <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/">a modified
