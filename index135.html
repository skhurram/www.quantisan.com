            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R55FWhzQQdI/AAAAAAAAAKU/EGtB6UIYZRE/s400/er2_day.jpg" />][]I thought of just mental trade today because it's my first day
at ER2. But then the signals were so good that I had to take a position.
It ended up well. I think this is a good way to limit myself, I simply
wouldn't trade until I thought I just had to take it.</p>
<p>Also, it seems that the first 2 hours and last 90 minutes of the day
session were easier to trade. The moves were more obvious.</p>
<p>Once I got my first trade in, I started to continue using my strategy.
However, like yesterday, there were many false positives. But unlike
yesterday, the price movements were less dramatic and I was able to inch
up my stop so even these wrong trades didn't eat me alive.</p>
<p>After like 3 or 4 false positives, I just stopped trading for the day
and watched Wall Street Warriors. Unfortunately, just minutes later, the
price finally broke and dived like I thought. It would have been an easy
\$700 there. The uptrend kept inching up until RUT broke 700 points (the
line of the bear, major resistance). I didn't think ER2 would break 700
so I entered at the hesitation ceiling but it broke. When ER2 is about
704 (RUT=701), there was another hesitation ceiling, I took a short and
got stopped out because I moved my stop to my entry. I thought the price
would go up again so I didn't try again. Then just a few minutes
afterward, the price finally broke down like I thought it would.</p>
<p>I could have entered a short at 703.80 and put a stop just above the
day's high, 704 something. It would have been a few pts of risk. But the
profit potential was high because we've been moving up all day and the
signals have been in OB for all day too. The break could have been
significant. I should have kept trying because the risk/reward were good
and both technical and fundamental were on my side.</p>
<p>What kept me from entering is remembering from last week's experience
with YM. False positives can easily eat out an account.</p>
<p>So lessons from today:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes it take a few tries for the price to break.</li>
<li>If risk/reward is really great and strategy says enter position, it
    might be worth another try.</li>
</ol>

lost money today.</p>
<p>Two reasons really:</p>
<ol>
<li>my stops are too tight</li>
<li>YM is too choppy</li>
</ol>
<p>I have cut down on erraneous trades but the false positives on the long
side today caught me many times. I don't think I'll be trading the Dow
from now on. Furthermore, the more I day trade, the more I want to
develop a trading system for mechanical trading. Day trading is giving
me experience and ideas for new strategies. I will get back on
programming soon.</p>
<p></p>
I have enabled CME data and will try the ER2 next week. I decided to
move to ER2 like I've always planned on. The only reason I haven't done
so earlier is that the stake is a lot higher there. But if I can trade
better there, then it'll be better than letting YM eat up a bit here and
a bit there even though it's \$5/pt. On the same day, here's the graph
for ER2. Notice that it's much nicer and fewer false signals, aka MM
traps.</p>

retracement on Stochastic crossing signal line IF it's not too far down.
Maybe Stochastic between 85 and 50 for long.</p>
<p>This could complement the Keltner channel, Stochastic, CCI strategy
because it would have exited on any retracement.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy</a> to catch a turn in trend using
Stochastic, Commodity Channel Index (CCI), and Keltner Channel. Here's
the concept. Enter position on concurrent signals from the following
indicators. CCI (which marks a turn), Stochastic (in corresponding
overbought or oversold zone for confirmation), and Keltner channel
(relative position of the current price) signals. To avoid hunting for
tops or bottoms in a strong move, do not enter if the current trend is
obviously opposite of the entry position. That can probably be filtered
by a 2-ema technique, MACD, or by analyzing a higher time frame. Below
are two example charts with all the indicators used illustrated along
with the entry signals. Blue dots for long entry, red for short. If you
