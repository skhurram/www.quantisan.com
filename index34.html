            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Market volatility continues in June. I took a more aggressive approach
this month and executed more trades in my RRSP trading account. The
monthly return is excellent but I noticed a few issues with my trading.
These will be the main topic of this post. Let's go over some
performance data. Seeing that it is the end of the second quarter, I
will do a quarterly statistical report. I couldn't do <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">a monthly review
like I used to</a> because I trade much less frequently now. Note that
the October data is from last year's forex trading. That was the best
month I've had. I am attaching the data here just for comparison.
<strong>Quarterly Metric Q2 October</strong> Sarting Fund \$8,000.00 End of Quarter
Fund \$9,404.87 Total Net Profit \$1,404.87 Gross Profit \$1,800 Gross
Loss -\$395 Profit Factor 4.56 1.75 Net Profit % <strong>17.56%</strong> 4.19% Max.
Drawdown % 3.36% 2.32% Total Commission \$155.1 Commission / Net Return
<strong>11.04%</strong> This highlight the bane of my problem trading my RRSP.
Although <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> offers the best commission in Canada as far as I
know, it is still much higher than those offered by brokers in the
states. However, this is a self-directed RRSP trading account, so it's
not like I can just switch broker. I will just have to stop being so
active in my trading for this particular account. Sterling Ratio 1.44
0.65 Excess Return 17.46% 4.14% SDev Return per Trade 2.21% 0.79%
Kurtosis -0.93 8.53 Skewness 0.72 2.49 These statistics above show my
second problem. Although I am very profitable so far, my return per
trade is not consistent. The distribution is too flat and not skewed
enough to the positive for my liking. A standard deviation less than 1%,
a slightly positive kurtosis, and a skewness above 1.0 would be ideal.
95th Percentile P&amp;L \$421.15 \$70.11 5th Percentile P&amp;L -\$102.13
-\$33.60 Net Profit Mid 90% Only \$0.29 \$46.34 Total # of Trades 14 34

Win% / Loss% 3.12 2.21 Max. Conseq. Winners 5 4 Max. Conseq. Losers 3 6
Largest Winning Trade \$464.05 \$171.79 Largest Losing Trade -\$116.75
-\$44.17 Most of my winning are due to <a href="../sold-12-cve-to-puts-2-90-mark-27-50-10-gain/">this Cenovus short in May</a> and
<a href="../sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">this CIBC short in June</a>. Avg. Time Held 5.17 days 2.18 hours Aside
from trading my RRSP account, I have finally opened a live <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">forex
account at Dukascopy</a>. My time remains split between developing
automated strategies for trading forex and manual equity trading as
usual. My JForex contest strategy in June ends up near the bottom again
as I took the wrong side of the move on USD/CAD. The JForex contest will
start with a new set of rules for July. Namely that strategies need to
be fully automated and winnings from each trade cannot be excessive
(50%) to prevent an all-in approach that's been dominating the contest.
My revised strategy is ready. It is now version 2.14 since the first
release in April.</p>
<h2>Goal for July</h2>
<p>My goal for July is to learn the indicators part of the JForex API and
to program my first custom JForex indicator from my other collection. I
will be away in Hong Kong for two weeks in July for some family matter.
So there's not much time to work.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>What I thought would be an intermediate term hold turns out to have
lasted mere minutes. I bought Teck Cominco (TCK.B.TO) after a small
bounce at \$34 support during lunch today. Figure 1 shows the clear
support level. Also note the fact that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-43-mark-16-27-loss-0-5/">my recent shorts haven't been
working</a>, so I thought I would go with the flow and go long. [caption

(TCK.B.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-06-28-TCK.B.TO.png" />][][/caption] However, the market edged lower almost
immediately after my long entry (something I haven't done in a while).
TCK cracked the \$34 support swiftly to \$33.80, my mental support. My
alert was sounded and I kept an eye on it afterward. But then not long
after \$33.80, my hard stop at \$33.70 was filled and TCK traded down to
\$33.66 or so. It has now stabilized around \$33.80 as of 2pm. Figure 2
shows the intraday chart of TCK.B.TO. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"
width="570" caption="TCK.B.TO intraday chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-06-28-TCK.B.TO-intra.gif" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-06-28-TCK.B.TO-intra.gif">1</a>[/caption] Loss
for this trade is (\$33.68 - \$34.10) * 250 = -\$105 - \$4.95 * 2
commission = -\$114.90 = -1.2% of account. My account is now
experiencing a 3.4% drawdown since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">the high on June 8th</a>. I can't
help but feel that this was a stop hunt. TCK is creeping higher at the
moment. However, as my initial position was stopped out, I am not going
to re-enter this trade just yet. Let's see what it does near the close
today. I am labelling this particular trade as a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">bad trade</a> because
my stop was clearly too tight based on the time frame that I am
observing. I should have reduced my position size and widened my stop to
account for the recent volatility. Update: TCK gapped down 7% the day
after. At least my exit was timely.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Not much is happening in the market as it is trading in a tight range.
This is not good for my options as the time delta will slowly eating
away my premium. So I've decided to unload this position at a small loss
just now as the market is testing support across the board. The U.S.
dollar index is testing \$86 resistance. Oil is testing \$78 support.
S&amp;P500 is testing the 1070 support zone. Purchase price for these puts
were <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-48-mark-16-38/">\$1.48 per contract last Wednesday</a>. When Manulife Financial
(MFC.TO) was trading at 16.38. Loss is (\$1.48 - \$1.43) * 100 * 4 =
\$20 - \$13.95 * 2 commission = \$47.90 = 0.5% of account. As you can
see, the commission is horrible on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">RRSP trading account at
Questrade</a>. I will wind down trading options from now on and move back
to trading forex in the summer. My live account at <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> is
ready... Update: The market finally broke support the day after this
exit. This was not a good exit as I lost patience. MFC is testing \$16
support on June 29th opening hour and I don't expect it to hold. This
could turn out to be a winner if I had held.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market is under pressure as illustrated by EUR/USD weakness (Figure
1). I'm not sure which way it will go just yet. But I am placing my bet
on the bears as oil (DBO) has already cracked. I waited the whole week
for a retracement to re-enter a short position. I thought the FOMC
announcement today could produce some sort of short-term rally. But
nothing materialized. This lack of a retracement rally after a 30 points
drop in the S&amp;P500 between Monday and Tuesday is good for the bears.
Furthermore, seeing that EUR/USD is testing resistance again, I am
establishing an equity short with a financial company. In particular,
Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) is my victim as it appears to be the weakest
of them all (Figure 2).</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="EUR/USD hourly
chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-06-23-EURUSD.png" />][][/caption] I say that because despite the recent advance
in the market, MFC.TO is still struggling around the year-low (Figure
2).</p>

<p>My mental stop is a close above \$16.50. A hard stop is \$1.00 on my
options premium.</p>
<p>That equates to (\$1.00 - \$1.48) * 100 * 4 = -\$192 - (\$13.95 x 2)
commission = \$219.90 = 2.3% of account.</p>
