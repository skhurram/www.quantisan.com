            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just got psyched out by the Euro rise and oil strength. So I closed my
oil short. My [purchase price was \$10.34][] two days ago on Tuesday.
Final result in this trade is (\$10.04 - \$10.34) - \$4.95 x 2
commission = -\$75 - \$9.90 = \$84.90 = 0.88% of RRSP trading account.
Normally I would wait for a retracement to exit, but the high volume of
U.S. DB Oil Fund (DBO) at the close yesterday plus the lack of weakness
at the open today (Figure 1) makes me uneasy. Note that even though
EUR/USD is making new highs today, the U.S. equity market isn't
following suit. In particular, S&amp;P500 is still below previous resistance
level around 1115. This may be a bear trap. Or, it could be a short term
term. I couldn't tell. So I'm staying on the sideline for now and will
just be watching the market play itself out. As you can see from my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trading log</a>, my last three trades were not profitable (2 losses and
1 breakeven). As such, I am putting myself on a cautionary mode until I
can grow my account back to my previous high point.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>My Barrick Gold short isn't working as I hoped. My puts premium is
moving closer to breakeven to my [purchase price of \$4.00][].
Furthermore, the market is cracking above <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-34/">resistance levels today</a>.
In particular, ABX.TO is marking a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern
after a test of its 50-day moving average support (Figure 1). Yes I
know, there's a massive resistance at \$44.00 for ABX.TO. But... As much
as I'd like to believe in the bears, this short position is not safe
anymore. I can't let a positive trade turn negative. It's better to miss
an opportunity than lose money. So I'm ditching this now to reduce my
risks at above breakeven seeing that I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-34/">another smaller short
position in play</a>. Which is underwater at the
close, by the way. My return on this trade is (\$4.15 - \$4.00) * 100
* 3 contracts = \$45 - \$12.95 x 2 commissions = \$19.10 I'm just
lightly short now and mostly in cash.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Current state of affair: S&amp;P500 testing 1108 resistance. Oil testing
77.50 resitance. EUR/USD testing 1.2350 resistance. USD/CAD marking
higher bottom at 1.0280, low of day was 1.0260. I am shorting oil
(HOD.TO) here because it looks like that the rally is non-sustainable in
the short term as we are testing resistances across the board within a
longer term downtrend. Moreover, the reward/risk is good at this point
since the stops are clear (e.g. the various resistance price levels in
first paragraph). Figure 1 is the long term chart of U.S. DB Oil Fund
(DBO). It shows DBO is at the top of a congestion zone in a longer term
down trend.</p>

<p>Evidently, my stop is DBO pass \$25. That is around \$10.00 for HOD.TO.</p>
<p>Thus, my risk is (\$10.34 - \$10.00) * 250 = \$85 + \$9.90 commission =
\$94.90 = 0.98% of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade RRSP trading account</a>.</p>
<p>Frankly, my conviction in this trade isn't that strong. But as the setup
is there and the reward/risk is good, I am taking a light stab at it.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Right on the heel of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-250-hod-to-10-59-0-95-loss/">my oil short loss</a>, I am taking another stab at
shorting the market. This one is Barrick Gold (ABX.TO). I am moving away
from shorting financials because the puts premium are almost doubled
that of the calls! It seems that too many people are betting the banks
will take a hit in the next fall. In the long term, ABX.TO appears to be
in an up trend. However, the intermediate trend is turning negative as
shown in Figure 1. \$45 is an obvious resistance for ABX.TO. Even with
today's positive market moves, ABX.TO fail to catch on the bullish wave
and only touched \$44.86 in the morning optimism (Figure 2). Who knows,
perhaps it might break it sooner than later. But the reward/risk is
decent to short ABX.TO seeing that the \$45 resistance is right above.</p>

<p>I will give it a month's time to move below \$44.00. Worst case stop
loss is \$2.50 on the premium. That is (\$2.50 - \$4.00) x 100 x 3 =
-\$450 - \$12.95 x 2 = \$475.90 = 5% of account total. My mental stop is
\$3.00 on the premium. Which is about 3.3% of my account total.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Oil broke above \$75 resistance overnight. So my Horizons BetaPro Crude
Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) gapped down below my 10.60 mental stop at the
open. I watched the U.S. DB Oil Fund (DBO) price actions this morning to
time my exit as shown on Figure 1. While the price gapped beyond my
stop, the volume was weak this morning (Figure 1). HOD.TO traded below
\$10.40 on the gap momentum but I held on because of the low volume.
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="U.S. DB Oil Fund
(DBO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-06-10-DBO_intra.gif" />][][/caption] I waited and waited until DBO traded near
24.50. This is a short term support level as shown in Figure 1. This was
also the equivalent of my previous stop loss for HOD.TO at \$10.60. Even
though I believe this is a stop hunt for the oil shorts because of the
lackluster volume, I am not one to argue with my plan. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-92/">pegged my
mental stop at 10.60 at the time of entry</a>. HOD.TO broke below my stop
price. I had three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ditch it at whatever price I can get.</li>
<li>Exit on retracement to my original stop price.</li>
<li>Exit on break-even.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the reasons as discussed above, I picked option #2. Here's a
calculation of my loss for this trade. (\$10.59 - \$10.92) * 250 shares
= -\$82.5 - \$9.90 commission = -\$92.40 = -0.95% loss of account total.
In any case, it looks as though my initial low-ball bid at 10.50 was a
good entry point. I shouldn't have gotten impatient and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-92/">entered at a
short-term resistance price level</a>.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I shorted oil using a Horizons BetaPro ETF (HOD.TO) at \$10.92 purchase
price for 250 shares. Spot crude oil is about \$74.75 at the time. US DB
Oil Fund (DBO), which is my proxy for my oil trades, is trading around
\$24.35 at the time of this entry. This is just below previous
support-turned-resistance at \$25. See Figure 1.</p>

<p>This position is also my bet on an equities downturn soon. I considered
buying puts (shorting) on Barrick Gold (ABX.TO), but I chose to be more
conservative with a smaller position in HOD.TO instead.</p>
<p>I actually opened a low-ball offer on HOD.TO at 10.60 in the morning.
But seeing that HOD.TO never touched below 10.70 today, I got impatient
and executed a market order when I saw it edging above its trading
range.</p>
<p>My stop for this position is 10.60. Risk is \$0.32 x 250 = 80 + \$9.90
commission. Which is about 0.92% of my RRSP trading account. This is
more in-line with my preferred risk level than my recent options trades.</p>
