            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I always try to keep my trading and any related costs as cheap as
possible. And there's nothing cheaper than free, which that is what
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is offering starting November 1, 2010. They
are offering a full year of free t1.micro EC2 instance along with other
basic level of AWS services (see link below). That seems to be a great
incentive to move my trading system on to a remote cloud server. One of
the biggest benefits of running your trading system on a virtual private
server or a cloud instance is reliability. I don't know about you, but
my internet connection sometimes acts up or even goes down for hours.
There's the occasional electrical power disruption too, but it's been
good these days. On the other hand, there are many disadvantages for
running your trading system remotely. Costs, technical know-hows, and
limited processing power, just to name a few. The added costs is not an
issue for now as Amazon is offering a year of free trial. With regard to
technical know-hows, I don't know how to setup a cloud server yet.
Although it shouldn't be a terribly difficult task for me as I am
familiar with Linux. What's at issue though, is the limited processing
power. The processing power of a t1.micro instance is an unspecified
fraction of one ECU, which is equivalent to a 1 GHz 2007 Intel Xeon
processor. So you get a fraction of that, which doesn't sound much.
CloudHarmony's benchmark shows that <a href="http://cloudharmony.com/benchmarks">a Micro instance is about 1/10th of
that of the Small instance</a>. However, a Micro instance can burst to up
to 2 ECUs (double that of the Small) of processing power occasionally.
This is good if you can keep your continuous processes minimal and only
make calculations infrequently (such as on arrival of a new price bar).
The t1.micro gets 613 MB of memory along with 10 GB of EBS (for
low-latency files) and 5 GB of S3 (for persistent storage). These
numbers are generous, so the bottleneck obviously remains with the
processor. Your best bet for minimal background processing use is to run
a command-line-only trading system. That's something that can be easily
done on JForex. However, there remains the question of is the minimum
power of a Micro sufficient to sustain a trading system? Any hiccup in a
trading system could cost you more than the annual charge for even a
Small instance. This freebie from Amazon may not be worth the risk. The
only way to know is to test it out. I won't be able to get to that soon
as I'm been busy programming. So if anyone is running a trading system
on a t1.micro instance, I'd really appreciate if you can provide some
feedback. Update Nov 6: See <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/first-time-setting-up-jforex-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">my first failed test</a> and then my first
time <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">running remote desktop on t1.micro</a>. Otherwise, enjoy the
freebie, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">AWS Free Usage Tier</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If you look closely at my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>, you will see that the amount
that I trade is small. I am not going to get rich anytime soon even if I
can maintain my 10% return or so every half a year. My wife was asking
me the other day why I don't plunk in more money to my trading accounts
since I have even <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">won a trading contest</a> and all. With accounts and
trading sizes so small, I am appearing to be just wasting my time. For
example, it took 2 to 3 hours of research and analysis the night before
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-300-ven-to-8-95-stop-8-80/">this recent trade in gold</a> and then just to see it make \$35. At
least it's slightly better than the minimum wage here. The real trial
though, is in facing a losing streak. Imagine spending hours and hours
pouring over price charts, economic news, and financial data only to see
your account shrink and shrink. Those are the times when you wonder why
you even bother putting in the hours. It just won't make a difference,
right? Well, here are my three motivations for trading a small account.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slow and steady.</strong> The fact is, trading is about aiming for
    consistency and not scoring that one-in-a-lifetime trade that'll
    make you rich. That took me a few years to realize. It is <em>a lot
    easier</em> to make pocket change than score a jackpot. Don't make
    trading harder on yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Trading comfortably.</strong> Hey, this is a hobby. I wouldn't last too
    long in this game if I'm sweating my palms with every position. If I
    bet my farm often, either my account will go broke or my sanity
    will. I prefer to keep my risk small enough to lasts and make
    trading <em>enjoyable</em>. If I want thrills, I go to a casino (there is
    actually a big casino 15 min. from my house).</li>
<li><strong>Walk before you run.</strong> Eventually though, as I become consistently
    profitable, I increase my risk ever so slightly step by step. Couple
    that with the effect of compounding, I may eventually be able to
    replace my salary with my trading income. That is probably still
    years away for me, but as people say, everybody has to start
    somewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>So no, I don't think trading a small size is a waste of my time. It is a
good <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">risk management, psychological mediation, and learning
technique</a> for amateur traders such as myself.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update: Crude is making a dive. This might be the move that I waited but
got stopped out. I shorted crude oil on Friday afternoon below the 82
resistance. It was an undocumented trade. Now I am closing at a loss.
It's a slap on the hand for breaking my own trading rules. Oil broke
above 82 over the weekend. Fortunately, the opening gap was filled
before noon and I took the opportunity to cover my short. I was down 1%
at the open. Good thing I didn't panic and waited patiently (with a hard
stop just below the opening low) for a more rational exit. My planned
stop was \$9.15, the opening low was \$8.87, and I covered at \$9.12.
Just a tad under my plan but a lot higher than the low so far. Figure 1
is a chart of U.S. Oil Fund (USO) at the time of my exit. I traded the
Horizons BetaPro Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) as a vehicle for shorting
crude oil. The chart of USO is a better proxy of crude oil prices as
it's a few magnitudes higher volume (i.e. more popular) than HOD.TO.
From the looks of it, I will stay on the sideline until at least the
midterm election in the United States next week. Loss for this trade is
(\$9.12 - \$9.29) * 300 = -\$51 - \$9.90 commission = -\$60.90 = -0.6%.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I got whipsawed out of my crude oil short as the market consolidates.
Seeing that the G20 is meeting in Seoul today and tomorrow, not much is
happening on this flat Friday. EUR/USD is in a 100 pips range. S&amp;P 500
is in a 5 points range. Maybe something will happen near the close, but
I won't be around for it as I have no position in the market anymore.
Crude oil is still looking bearish though as it is crawling on its short
term support line (Fig. 1). Perhaps my stop was just too tight as I
moved it up a couple of times to lock in some profits. Profit is
(<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-300-hod-to-9-19-stop-9-05/">\$9.40</a> - \$9.19) * 300 = \$63 - \$9.90 commission = \$53.10 = 0.5%
