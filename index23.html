            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If you look closely at my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>, you will see that the amount
that I trade is small. I am not going to get rich anytime soon even if I
can maintain my 10% return or so every half a year. My wife was asking
me the other day why I don't plunk in more money to my trading accounts
since I have even <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">won a trading contest</a> and all. With accounts and
trading sizes so small, I am appearing to be just wasting my time. For
example, it took 2 to 3 hours of research and analysis the night before
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-300-ven-to-8-95-stop-8-80/">this recent trade in gold</a> and then just to see it make \$35. At
least it's slightly better than the minimum wage here. The real trial
though, is in facing a losing streak. Imagine spending hours and hours
pouring over price charts, economic news, and financial data only to see
your account shrink and shrink. Those are the times when you wonder why
you even bother putting in the hours. It just won't make a difference,
right? Well, here are my three motivations for trading a small account.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slow and steady.</strong> The fact is, trading is about aiming for
    consistency and not scoring that one-in-a-lifetime trade that'll
    make you rich. That took me a few years to realize. It is <em>a lot
    easier</em> to make pocket change than score a jackpot. Don't make
    trading harder on yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Trading comfortably.</strong> Hey, this is a hobby. I wouldn't last too
    long in this game if I'm sweating my palms with every position. If I
    bet my farm often, either my account will go broke or my sanity
    will. I prefer to keep my risk small enough to lasts and make
    trading <em>enjoyable</em>. If I want thrills, I go to a casino (there is
    actually a big casino 15 min. from my house).</li>
<li><strong>Walk before you run.</strong> Eventually though, as I become consistently
    profitable, I increase my risk ever so slightly step by step. Couple
    that with the effect of compounding, I may eventually be able to
    replace my salary with my trading income. That is probably still
    years away for me, but as people say, everybody has to start
    somewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>So no, I don't think trading a small size is a waste of my time. It is a
good <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">risk management, psychological mediation, and learning
technique</a> for amateur traders such as myself.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update: Crude is making a dive. This might be the move that I waited but
got stopped out. I shorted crude oil on Friday afternoon below the 82
resistance. It was an undocumented trade. Now I am closing at a loss.
It's a slap on the hand for breaking my own trading rules. Oil broke
above 82 over the weekend. Fortunately, the opening gap was filled
before noon and I took the opportunity to cover my short. I was down 1%
at the open. Good thing I didn't panic and waited patiently (with a hard
stop just below the opening low) for a more rational exit. My planned
stop was \$9.15, the opening low was \$8.87, and I covered at \$9.12.
Just a tad under my plan but a lot higher than the low so far. Figure 1
is a chart of U.S. Oil Fund (USO) at the time of my exit. I traded the
Horizons BetaPro Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) as a vehicle for shorting
crude oil. The chart of USO is a better proxy of crude oil prices as
it's a few magnitudes higher volume (i.e. more popular) than HOD.TO.
From the looks of it, I will stay on the sideline until at least the
midterm election in the United States next week. Loss for this trade is
(\$9.12 - \$9.29) * 300 = -\$51 - \$9.90 commission = -\$60.90 = -0.6%.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I got whipsawed out of my crude oil short as the market consolidates.
Seeing that the G20 is meeting in Seoul today and tomorrow, not much is
happening on this flat Friday. EUR/USD is in a 100 pips range. S&amp;P 500
is in a 5 points range. Maybe something will happen near the close, but
I won't be around for it as I have no position in the market anymore.
Crude oil is still looking bearish though as it is crawling on its short
term support line (Fig. 1). Perhaps my stop was just too tight as I
moved it up a couple of times to lock in some profits. Profit is
(<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-300-hod-to-9-19-stop-9-05/">\$9.40</a> - \$9.19) * 300 = \$63 - \$9.90 commission = \$53.10 = 0.5%

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I shorted some crude oil to hedge my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-300-ven-to-8-95-stop-8-80/">gold miner long</a> right at 2 pm
today. EURUSD looks to be trading in a range. And since FOMC and G20 are
right around the corner, I am not expecting the market to do anything
drastic (i.e. breakout). So I am shorting commodity (to long US dollar)
as EUR/USD is at the top of its channel (Fig. 1). I picked Horizons
BetaPro Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) because it's one of the most active
reverse ETF on the TSX. I considered buying HFD.TO (for shorting
financials) but that one has a fraction of the volume of HOD.TO. The
falling star candle right below the 82.50 resistance on the hourly chart
of crude oil (Fig. 2) is also a factor in my timing. Risk is (\$9.19 -
\$9.05) * 300 = \$42 + \$9.90 commission = \$51.90 = 0.5% of account.
Figures 1 and 2 were captured at the time of entry. The markets are
still hanging on the ceiling approaching the close. [caption id=""
