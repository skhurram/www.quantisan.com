            <div class="article-content"> <p>Remember <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/vno-short-entry-stop-4970/">Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)</a>? Well, I'm back to shorting it
with this new August puts position. Yesterday, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-31-srs-22-45/">Ultrashort Real Estate
(SRS)</a> tanked about 9% to touch \$13 while the overall market is
mostly unchanged. I also noticed some big down TICK (\&lt; -1000) were
finally appearing. This is a sign that big blocks were being dumped. We
haven't see those in a long time.</p>
<p>I tried to short VNO near the close but the price never came back to me.
VNO stayed below \$54 resistance. So I held my bid to wait for today. We
seem to have a lot of bear traps lately so it's better late than early.
Well, today we broke above \$55 to touch \$55.61 (a major resistance)
and backed down immediately. In the first half hour alone, it seemed
like VNO is starting to decline. This is a good sign since S&amp;P500 also
broke below 1000 in the first half hour with some big negative TICK (\&lt;
-800). This is definitely going to be an interesting day.</p>
<p>What enticed me the most in VNO is shown in Figure 2. VNO has been
respecting the Fibonacci fan lines from the recent crack of late
'08/early '09 very well. So this failed push above it this morning was a
good signal for me to go short now (coupled with the market weakness).</p>
<p>Entry: \$54.60</p>
<p>Stop: \$55.5</p>
<p>Target: \$47, but looking at \$43 in the intermediate term (prob need to
rollover the puts)</p>
<p>Reward / Risk = 7.6 / 0.9 = 8.4</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is a belated post on a re-entry for Retail HOLDRS ETF (RTH). I
entered into a RTH short again last Friday when we failed to stay above
\$83 into the close. The doji on Thursday seemed like a good pause for
the rise. Then the inside-day (trading within the range of the previous
day) on Friday with a close looking to be below the resistance seemed
good to go short at the time. Then Monday we made a slightly new high
and closed near the top. Today is continued indecision in the market as
we hung onto a high level. (See Figure 1)</p>
<p>However, we've never touched my mental stop of \$83.91 (Figure 2) yet.
Thus, I continue to hold this position while the price swings around.</p>
<p>Entry: \$82.91</p>
<p>Stop: \$83.91</p>
<p>Target: \$79</p>
<p>Reward / Risk = 3.91 / 1 = 3.91 \&lt; 5, which is less than my trading rule
stated. I'm gonna tighten my stop to \$83.50 based on today's (Tuesday)
action.</p>
<p>New stop = \$83.50</p>
<p>New Target = \$80</p>
<p>New Reward / Risk = 2.91 / 0.59 = 4.9 \&lt; 5 ... still not good!</p>
<p>This isn't a good entry because I based this entry mostly on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-rth-100-aug-09-85-put-4-00-mark-81-96/">my
previous analysis</a> plus the charts of the day and didn't reassess the
situation fully. I was away on holiday on Friday when I made this trade
near the close so I didn't even have all of my analytical tools
available.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market gapped higher today. RTH broke the 82 resistance clean at the
open. It touched 83.75 at the high point but closed with a doji on low
volume for the day. I was very tempted to hold my short overnight
because of the heavy last hour selling. This certainly looks like the
day to call it a top. However, I've been feeling like this for weeks, if
not months, now and the market keeps going higher.</p>
<p>So I've managed to be disciplined and dumped my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-rth-100-aug-09-85-put-4-00-mark-81-96/">short RTH position</a>
seconds before the close. Seeing that although the last hour is
encouraging for the bears, we still didn't close the gap.</p>
<p>Also, I'll be away tomorrow, so the risk is just too much as my stop has
come and gone already. Even though this trade didn't turn out as
planned. I'm glad that I've stuck to my strategy and didn't push my luck
as I've done so many times before, only to regret my decisions.</p>
<p>It's better to be late to risk paper profit than be early and lose real
money.</p>
<p>For this trade, my loss is \$120 + \$15 = \$135. Oh well, it could have
been worse. The choice to hold out until the end of day to sell the
losing position was a good one. I noticed in the morning that sentiment
wasn't that strong as we inched upward. Particular on a big gap day, we
need some serious momentum to push the market deeper. That didn't happen
as I watched this morning so I decided to wait until the last hour.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is a small short position entered just seconds before the close
today. Here's my case for further weakness.</p>
<ol>
<li>The market gap down from this morning remained open.</li>
<li>We have intraday big block dumps (highest 1 min volume bar
    correspond with big drop)</li>
<li>We are making lower highs and lower lows these past few days,
    although barely</li>
<li>This market has been brutal on the bears. So a significant move
    could be imminent as most bearish retailers aren't positioned to
    benefit from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the recent strong closes are not to be missed. We've been
having good up volume in the last minutes of the close these past few
days.</p>
<p></p>
My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-2-oih-100-aug-09-105-put-6-706-80-mark-100-25/">OIH short was a good play today</a>. However, its reward/risk isn't
as good now. So I'm entering into RTH purely for its limited risk. It's
right up against the resistance now. Although it's very possible that
it'll gap up to take out the obvious stops. That's why I'm using a small
position in case it gaps up to close the long term gap (\$83.50).</p>
<p>Entry: \$81.96</p>
<p>Exit stop: \$82.40</p>
<p>Target: \$79.00</p>
<p>Reward / Risk = 2.96 / 0.44 = 6.7</p>
