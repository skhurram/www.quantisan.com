                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/software-design-trading-development-process-and-ikea/" rel='bookmark'>Software design, trading development process, and Ikea</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I spent a few months between 2010 and 2011 not on the market, not on
coming up with new strategies, but on developing a software framework
for my trading system. For my trading strategy development, I make use
of a continuous systems development life cycle process from the
engineering realm. Starting from planning, to analysis, to design, to
implementation, to maintenance, and finally, back to planning, and so on
for each and every new concept that I have. (see <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/04/in-praise-of-failure/all/1">Sir James Dyson's
guest column on Wired</a>) Imagine that if you need to write a new
strategy file for each and every idea and for each of its design
iteration. Pretty soon you'll have many strategy files and a lot of
boilerplate codes. What if you found a bug or figured out some
enhancements to a particular component of your strategy? Then you'll
have to sift through all those files and make the changes to all those
relevant codes to make the update across the board. Hopefully, this
isn't the approach you're taking. Yet, a few trading API that I have
used before inherently encourage or even limit you (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">EasyLanguage and
MQL4</a>) to this archaic procedural programming paradigm. Luckily, Java
is an object-oriented programming language. However, it is only as
object-oriented as you make it to be. JForex, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/jforex">the trading API that I
use</a>, actually runs on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/more-trouble-with-jforex-iindicators/">the edge of breaking this
object-orientedness</a> as I have recently lamented. The bad news for the
beginning developer is that practically every published strategy which I
have seen or <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/source-code/">guilty of posting myself</a> are illustrations of what not
to do with software design. In that there's none in it whatsoever. Think
of common published strategies like the Ikea mini-model showrooms.
Everything is crammed into a tiny space but it is a simple way to convey
the gist of a room design (read: the trading algorithm). However, they
are not built for practical use. Real strategies are like suites in an
apartment building. There is an underlying architectural commonality for
easy management and maintenance while enabling diversity in the
strategies. My recently completed software framework dramatically made
my life easier in the tasks of implementation and maintenance. Software
maintenance, in particular, is most often needlessly and overly
complicated in trading strategy development because of the lack of a
good design. Because at the end of the day, most programmers spend the
majority of their time debugging, maintaining, and extending their code.
A true object-oriented design decouples all its components so that you
can use a divide and conquer approach with no repetition of work. Do you
have a development process in place? I'd like to hear how you tackle
this problem.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Yes, this is still Quantisan.com. In case anyone is visiting and noticed
the different design. I've made some major changes to the website over
the weekend for both aesthetic and technical reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Professionally designed.</strong> The previous theme was something that I
    hacked together over a weekend. It's actually pretty bad under the
    hood as I had only learned PHP scripting to write that theme. This
    new theme is a minor tweak over a professional framework. It enables
    more flexibility to the page layout. Expect some major changes to
    the front page in the weeks to come as this personal blog transforms
    into a company site.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced computing resource hog.</strong> I disabled a number of Wordpress
    plugin modules as the theme has already taken care of things like
    search engine optimisation.</li>
<li><strong>Optimised page loading time.</strong> The code for the new design is also
    optimised for faster page load times with built-in optimisation of
    javascript and css file loading.</li>
<li><strong>Geographically distributed content delivery network.</strong> As forex is
    a global endeavour, the readers to this blog is quite geographically
    diverse. While the site is hosted in the U.S., I want to ensure the
    readers from Germany and India (8% of my readers) have a smooth
    browsing experience too. The use of a CDN to mirror contents around
    the world makes this possible.</li>
<li><strong>Bad traffic filtering</strong>. A significant traffic on the web is due
    to software crawlers. Some of them post spam comments on my blog or
    copy my copyrighted materials. I added a server-side security
    control service to block all those unwanted traffic. This increases
    security and reduces unnecessary server load.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might have noticed that aside from point #1, which is purely
aesthetic, everything else is done to improve page load time for readers
to this blog. The result is that the new loading time is down to about
4.0 seconds. Whereas the old site took around 8 seconds to load. You
might think this cost a fortune. But it still costs less than most small
websites out there. The old site cost me \$30 <em>per year</em> to run,
including everything from domain name registration to web hosting. The
new total is still only up to \$70 <em>per year</em>. The key to the savings is
that I made use of a free network enhancement service
(<a href="http://www.cloudflare.com">cloudflare.com)</a> and exploited my remote server and network
optimisation knowledge acquired from the long nights of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/vps">administering a
remote trading server</a>. Technology is cheap nowadays. The real values
are in the ability to deliver on that technology to bring about even
greater return. This is what drives everything I do at Quantisan
Systems.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I hope this is a April Fool's joke but it isn't. As shown, the Dukascopy
JForex DEMO platform version 2.13.6 released this week is causing havoc
to my strategy. I tested my contest strategy, which has been running
fine for almost a year, but is now failing left and right. Even though
this is only happening with the DEMO platform (the LIVE platform is a
stable release and is running fine at the moment), the fact that they
published a buggy version for us developers as guinea pigs is upsetting.
JForex developers are clients too, after all. [caption

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>JFUtil offers [an elegant way of requesting indicators from the JForex
IIndicators interface][]. But the new design for JForex IIndicators
through JFUtil is only fixing one side of the problem. There is still
the question of what to do with the multiple return types from the
calculations. In JForex, indicators like RSI returns a one-dimensional
array. Other indicators like Stochastic Oscillator returns a
two-dimensional array. And some other ones return three or more
dimensional arrays. Java doesn't allow overloading a method with
multiple return types, as the program wouldn't know what to expect. So
how can we get rid of coding mess like this in our JForex strategy?
[java] Stochastic stochBean = IndicatorBeanFactory.getStochastic();
Object[] objs = Indicating.calculateMultiDimension(instrument,
Period.ONE_MIN, stochBean, 1); double[][] sto = new double[2][]; sto[0]
= (double[])objs[0]; // %K values sto[1] = (double[])objs[1]; // %D
values [/java] The default calculation method in JForex returns a
generic Object array. It's up to the programmer to know what to expect
from the call and cast the Object into something useful. Obviously, this
is a recipe for programming headaches and runtime errors. Having said
this, one of the biggest benefits of JForex is that it uses a standard
programming language like Java. So if there's something that you don't
like about the API, you can probably change it (e.g. Facade pattern).
This is the purpose of JFUtil to some extent, to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">simplify the JForex
API behaviour</a>. In any case, I'm sure other Java programmers have
faced this problem before and have come up with good solutions for it. A
search on stackoverflow.com doesn't yield a quick fix solution at first
glimpse. My guess is that this require leveraging the knowledge about
the program structure. We know in advance what dimension of the
calculation result we can expect based on the indicator itself, perhaps
I can use something like a Command pattern to choose a calculation
sub-routine and then return a Map object with named values? I have yet
to try implementing this. I am open to design suggestions to encapsulate
multiple return values through a single interface. So that any indicator
bean can use the same calculation interface with an easy to use output.
In the mean time, getting multi-dimensional indicators results through
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">JFUtil 2.1.2</a> isn't pretty.</p>
