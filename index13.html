            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Yes, this is still Quantisan.com. In case anyone is visiting and noticed
the different design. I've made some major changes to the website over
the weekend for both aesthetic and technical reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Professionally designed.</strong> The previous theme was something that I
    hacked together over a weekend. It's actually pretty bad under the
    hood as I had only learned PHP scripting to write that theme. This
    new theme is a minor tweak over a professional framework. It enables
    more flexibility to the page layout. Expect some major changes to
    the front page in the weeks to come as this personal blog transforms
    into a company site.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced computing resource hog.</strong> I disabled a number of Wordpress
    plugin modules as the theme has already taken care of things like
    search engine optimisation.</li>
<li><strong>Optimised page loading time.</strong> The code for the new design is also
    optimised for faster page load times with built-in optimisation of
    javascript and css file loading.</li>
<li><strong>Geographically distributed content delivery network.</strong> As forex is
    a global endeavour, the readers to this blog is quite geographically
    diverse. While the site is hosted in the U.S., I want to ensure the
    readers from Germany and India (8% of my readers) have a smooth
    browsing experience too. The use of a CDN to mirror contents around
    the world makes this possible.</li>
<li><strong>Bad traffic filtering</strong>. A significant traffic on the web is due
    to software crawlers. Some of them post spam comments on my blog or
    copy my copyrighted materials. I added a server-side security
    control service to block all those unwanted traffic. This increases
    security and reduces unnecessary server load.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might have noticed that aside from point #1, which is purely
aesthetic, everything else is done to improve page load time for readers
to this blog. The result is that the new loading time is down to about
4.0 seconds. Whereas the old site took around 8 seconds to load. You
might think this cost a fortune. But it still costs less than most small
websites out there. The old site cost me \$30 <em>per year</em> to run,
including everything from domain name registration to web hosting. The
new total is still only up to \$70 <em>per year</em>. The key to the savings is
that I made use of a free network enhancement service
(<a href="http://www.cloudflare.com">cloudflare.com)</a> and exploited my remote server and network
optimisation knowledge acquired from the long nights of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/vps">administering a
remote trading server</a>. Technology is cheap nowadays. The real values
are in the ability to deliver on that technology to bring about even
greater return. This is what drives everything I do at Quantisan
Systems.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I hope this is a April Fool's joke but it isn't. As shown, the Dukascopy
JForex DEMO platform version 2.13.6 released this week is causing havoc
to my strategy. I tested my contest strategy, which has been running
fine for almost a year, but is now failing left and right. Even though
this is only happening with the DEMO platform (the LIVE platform is a
stable release and is running fine at the moment), the fact that they
published a buggy version for us developers as guinea pigs is upsetting.
JForex developers are clients too, after all. [caption

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>JFUtil offers [an elegant way of requesting indicators from the JForex
IIndicators interface][]. But the new design for JForex IIndicators
through JFUtil is only fixing one side of the problem. There is still
the question of what to do with the multiple return types from the
calculations. In JForex, indicators like RSI returns a one-dimensional
array. Other indicators like Stochastic Oscillator returns a
two-dimensional array. And some other ones return three or more
dimensional arrays. Java doesn't allow overloading a method with
multiple return types, as the program wouldn't know what to expect. So
how can we get rid of coding mess like this in our JForex strategy?
[java] Stochastic stochBean = IndicatorBeanFactory.getStochastic();
Object[] objs = Indicating.calculateMultiDimension(instrument,
Period.ONE_MIN, stochBean, 1); double[][] sto = new double[2][]; sto[0]
= (double[])objs[0]; // %K values sto[1] = (double[])objs[1]; // %D
values [/java] The default calculation method in JForex returns a
generic Object array. It's up to the programmer to know what to expect
from the call and cast the Object into something useful. Obviously, this
is a recipe for programming headaches and runtime errors. Having said
this, one of the biggest benefits of JForex is that it uses a standard
programming language like Java. So if there's something that you don't
like about the API, you can probably change it (e.g. Facade pattern).
This is the purpose of JFUtil to some extent, to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">simplify the JForex
API behaviour</a>. In any case, I'm sure other Java programmers have
faced this problem before and have come up with good solutions for it. A
search on stackoverflow.com doesn't yield a quick fix solution at first
glimpse. My guess is that this require leveraging the knowledge about
the program structure. We know in advance what dimension of the
calculation result we can expect based on the indicator itself, perhaps
I can use something like a Command pattern to choose a calculation
sub-routine and then return a Map object with named values? I have yet
to try implementing this. I am open to design suggestions to encapsulate
multiple return values through a single interface. So that any indicator
bean can use the same calculation interface with an easy to use output.
In the mean time, getting multi-dimensional indicators results through
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">JFUtil 2.1.2</a> isn't pretty.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The JForex API is not perfect. Like any application programming
interface (API), some parts of the JForex API is better designed than
others. One of the most gripping problems with JForex is its use of
technical analysis (TA) indicators. Here's an example of using an
exponential moving average, one of the most simplest indicators.
<code>ema(instrument, Period.TEN_SECS, OfferSide.BID, IIndicators.AppliedPrice.MEDIAN_PRICE, 14, 0);</code>
And the corresponding javadoc explaining the parameters,
<code>Parameters: instrument instrument of the bar period period of the bar side bid or ask side of the bar appliedPrice type of input data timePeriod time period value shift number of candle back in time staring from current bar. 0 - current bar (currently generated from ticks), 1 - previous bar (last formed bar), 2 - current bar minus 2 bars and so on</code>
It's not intuitive but it's usable. Recall that in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/getting-started-learning-jforex-programming/">JForex
programming tutorial</a>, I suggested using the JForex API javadoc to
find out information about the API. However, for the case of
IIndicators, if you <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/com/dukascopy/api/IIndicators.html">take a look at its javadoc</a>, you will only be led
to more confusion by the hundred or so mysterious indicator methods with
cryptic parameter names. In JForex API, if you want to calculate an
indicator, you need to look through a long list of abbreviated method
names in the javadoc. Many of which are not easy to decipher. Secondly,
you need to figure out the generic parameters and set them correctly,
which is different for almost every indicator. Lastly, as there is no
standard interface for indicators, you need to hardcode these into your
strategy with little flexibility. In contrast, here's the same call
using <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">JFUtil 2.1.0</a> to get an EMA value. It has notably more lines of
code. It is designed deliberately so using an object oriented approach
by encapsulating the indicator parameters into a bean object and
abstracting the calculation into a single generic function call. [java]
// get an EMA indicator value by building an indicator bean
MovingAverage maBean = IndicatorBeanFactory.getMovingAverage(); // then
sets its parameters with obvious method names
maBean.setAppliedPrice(IIndicators.AppliedPrice.MEDIAN_PRICE)
.setMAType(IIndicators.MaType.EMA) .setWidth(14); // all of these are
optional parameters // feed the bean into a generic calculation method
to get the result double ema = Indicating.calculate(instrument,
Period.ONE_MIN, maBean); [/java] With JFUtil, to calculate an
indicator, you create an indicator bean with the intuitive bean name
that corresponds with the full name of an indicator. For example, a
moving average will be MovingAverage. Then you set the
indicator-specific parameters using clearly defined methods with useful
javadoc descriptions. One method for one parameter. Lastly, you feed
this indicator bean into a generic calculation function to get your
value. It took some thinking to abstract and generalize such a rigidly
structured API. I am quite pleased with this new design as the current
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">JFUtil opens up a lot of design flexibility</a>. Such as
dynamic indicator selection with genetic algorithm and interchangeable
indicators use for runtime adaptive algorithms.</p> </div>
