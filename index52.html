            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I spent most of 2008 trading futures and developing automated systems on
Tradestation. The futures trading didn't turn out so well as I lost 40%
of my account and had to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/retirement-from-futures-trading-and-back-to-stocks/">call it quit</a>. My quant development work on
the other hand, was coming along slow but steadily. However, since I
couldn't bear the monstrous maintenance fee anymore at <a href="http://www.tradestation.com/">Tradestation</a>,
I had to abandon that work. Then last year <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-thoughts-and-goals-on-automated-trading-a-year-later/">when I wanted to pick up
where I left off</a> on Matlab, I found that I couldn't just continue my
work. For one, I've lost most of my files. I think I left them in my
other computer in Hong Kong. Which is probably in a landfill by now.
Secondly, I didn't keep a thorough journal <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2008/">back then in 2008</a> like
I'm doing now. Lastly, from the important files that I've kept, I didn't
bother to convert the codes because I might as well write new ones from
scratch than figure out what I did. The reason why I am reminiscing at
the moment is because I am finding myself in the same cycle again. As
regular readers may be aware, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-to-do-when-life-gets-in-your-way-of-trading/">recent events</a> have accelerated my
quant projects schedule. I am experimenting with using Metatrader 4 for
my foreign exchange trading and scripting in MQL4 for automated trading.
Like Tradestation, <a href="http://www.metaquotes.net/en/metatrader4">Metatrader 4</a> is a trading platform with scripting
capabilities. Its programming language, MQL4, is a proprietary language
based on C. I took a few hours this weekend to learn it (as I'm familiar
with C already). So that I can start coding this week. However, after
giving it more thought, I've decided to scale down on my projects with
MQL4. I don't want to rely on a proprietary system for short-term
convenience. As trading programmers know, the language used is merely a
choice. Experience tells me that the bulk of development time is not
spent on the actual programming itself. Rather, much of the time is
spent on formulating, analyzing, and optimizing your algorithm. So I
might as well bite the bullet to build from scratch my automated trading
systems and quant analytics on one platform (i.e. on Python). That has
been my long term plan all along. Everything under one roof. But I
digressed. Then there's the issue of re-useability. Metatrader 4 is
forex-only and only works with brokers that support it. As such, I would
have to use something else for stock trading. Even for a forex-only
system, it would help if I can do intermarket analysis quantitatively.
That's not possible as far as I know with MQL4. Which is another major
downside for me. To summarize other reasons on how I came about this
decision, here are the advantages and disadvantages of using MQL4 versus
using a general programming language, such as Python or C++. The
advantages of using MQL4 are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Saves A LOT of development time as it's already built for trading</li>
<li>Charting, manual and automated trading on one platform</li>
<li>Based on the popular C programming language</li>
<li>Many forex traders use it</li>
<li>Large repertoire of forex-specific programs</li>
</ol>
<p>Disadvantages of using MQL4.</p>
<ol>
<li>Not for real quant analysis or data mining</li>
<li>Limited to MT4-supported brokers</li>
<li>Forex trading only</li>
<li>Proprietary programming language</li>
<li>Must run on Metatrader 4 client terminal</li>
<li>MQL5 coming soon</li>
</ol>
<p>This is certainly a tough choice. Judging by the huge user base, it's
evident that many people are satisfied with MQL4. Yet, as I've discussed
here, there are downsides to using it (besides technical matters). My
current plan remains the same as what I said in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">my last month's trading
review</a>. That is, I will use MQL4 to plug holes in my trading system
for now before migrating to build my own system. In fact, I am already
brewing my first expert advisor starting today. Perhaps I might even
have something to post by the end of this week.</p>

Update: It doesn't look as though Dukascopy will proceed with using MT4.
So you might as well look for another broker if you need MT4 or [learn
to use JForex][] if you plan on sticking with Dukascopy. Just received
the following news from [Dukascopy][] (attached below) regarding their
Metatrader accounts. Basically, they are raising their minimum lot-size
on MT4-enabled accounts to a mini-lot (10k). Micro-lot (1000 units)
trading remains exclusive to their basic (JForex only) accounts. Well,
why do bad news keep coming to me just when I'm about to go live with a
forex broker? First it was Oanda (although the problem was at my end
with them), then Dukascopy. There's no way I'm able to trade with a
mini-lot because of my strict [risk management][] rules. So I would be
stuck with the JForex platform for a while if I'm going to trade with
them. I like the JForex platform. It is simple, clean, easy to use, and
powerful. However, Metatrader is just substantially more popular. There
are hundreds of free scripts, indicators, and expert advisers published
at MQL4.com for me to edit to my liking. If I go with JForex, I'd have
to write everything from scratch. The whole point of me using a built-in
editor is to save time. So I might as well program in Python and use an
API if I need to go through learning JForex scripting, programming, and
testing. As much as I like [Dukascopy][] (35% commission rebate
affiliate link), ~~I may not be going through to trade with them
anymore. Unfortunate, really.~~

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well this was awful. USDCAD continued on a rampage upward and I was
caught on the wrong side of the fence. Total loss for this was 0.12% of
my account. At least I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">was light in it</a>. In retrospect, I broke my
own rule and didn't enter at one of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">4 fundamental entry points</a>.
However, after some bear rampage throughout the markets today
(Bloomberg: [Stocks Plunge on Concern Rising Debt, Job Losses Threaten
Global Recovery][]), USDCAD is at the top of my channel as shown in
Figure 1 below. So while my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">previous entry</a>
was early. USDCAD at this price is a good short. I will take it slow
this time by setting a limit order below current support on the 4-hour
at 1.0680, with a stop at 1.0750. And then adding a second chunk at
1.0640, my stopped out price. As is customarily lately, I am only
risking 0.1% of my account on the initial order. On a weekly chart,
1.0750 to 1.0810 is obviously a strong resistance for the USDCAD. It is
a congestion zone in 2007 and 2008. Then USDCAD spent the last quarter
of 2009 trying to break this resistance to no avail. But who knows,
perhaps USDCAD has had enough and it will break this resistance
decisively soon. That's why I'm only betting on this reversal with
limited risk. It's just a matter of wait and see now.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Sometimes, things in life will get in the way of your trading. From down
with a cold to your internet service provider acting up, there are times
when your are not able to trade in your ideal zone. What do you do in
these disadvantaged circumstances? Do you take some NyQuil or whip out
your Blackberry, and then continue trading? This decision certainly
depends on the severity of your handicap and your trading
responsibility. If you have a massive open position with no stop, you'd
better suck it up and do something about it quick. For amateurs such as
myself with nobody to answer to but my own account, I would scale out of
my positions and then stop trading to focus on fixing my obstacle. I am
faced with this question recently and here's what I'm doing about it. I
have been practicing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> forex for the past few months
working out some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading signals</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">strategies</a> before going
live. During this time, I have become very fond of the 3-hour chart. My
strategy essentially boils down to making high-level decisions on the
weekly and daily charts, then executing my trades on the 3-hour and
1-hour charts. I've written specifically about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">my basic setup</a> and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">how I scale into a trade on the 3-hour timeframe</a>. This latter
technique, along with managing my stops, are the basis of my risk
management. So imagine the disruption to my perfect world when I was
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/barred-from-trading-at-work-a-curse-or-a-gift/">barred from trading at my day job</a> last month. The first step I took
is to adapt my trading strategy. I tried trading a longer timeframe so
that I don't have to move my orders every few hours. But the inability
to limit my risks is really getting to me. That was the best part of my
trading system and now I can't use it anymore. This is one big hole into
my trading strategy. So rather than continue on trading with a handicap,
I've decided to cast my trading aside to focus on remedying this problem
as soon as possible. Here are my 2 reasons for it.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are always opportunities in the market.</li>
<li>There is no handicap system in trading.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since my best trading system is effectively broken at this point, I
cannot perform as well as I should. Rather than compete with the rest of
the world in a handicapped state, it's better for me to ease back on
trading to put my effort to fixing my shortcomings. The longer I delay,
the more my demo account would be unnecessary exposed. In fact,
continuing to trade full force with a handicap would just be reckless
and arrogant. I am <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">just scrapping by</a> when I'm well. I can't imagine
how deep my drawdown would be if I trade without my best technique. Here
is my trading plan for the next few weeks. I will trade another strategy
using a longer timeframe. I will limit my risks and focus by holding at
most 2 positions at a time with maximum of 0.2% of account at risk for
each. The majority (about 70%) of my usual trading time will be spent on
learning <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/MQL4/">MQL 4</a> and developing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated risk management systems</a>.
That's the story of my problem and solution. What do you do when life
gets in your way of trading?</p>
