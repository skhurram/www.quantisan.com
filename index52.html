Update: It doesn't look as though Dukascopy will proceed with using MT4.
So you might as well look for another broker if you need MT4 or [learn
to use JForex][] if you plan on sticking with Dukascopy. Just received
the following news from [Dukascopy][] (attached below) regarding their
Metatrader accounts. Basically, they are raising their minimum lot-size
on MT4-enabled accounts to a mini-lot (10k). Micro-lot (1000 units)
trading remains exclusive to their basic (JForex only) accounts. Well,
why do bad news keep coming to me just when I'm about to go live with a
forex broker? First it was Oanda (although the problem was at my end
with them), then Dukascopy. There's no way I'm able to trade with a
mini-lot because of my strict [risk management][] rules. So I would be
stuck with the JForex platform for a while if I'm going to trade with
them. I like the JForex platform. It is simple, clean, easy to use, and
powerful. However, Metatrader is just substantially more popular. There
are hundreds of free scripts, indicators, and expert advisers published
at MQL4.com for me to edit to my liking. If I go with JForex, I'd have
to write everything from scratch. The whole point of me using a built-in
editor is to save time. So I might as well program in Python and use an
API if I need to go through learning JForex scripting, programming, and
testing. As much as I like [Dukascopy][] (35% commission rebate
affiliate link), ~~I may not be going through to trade with them
anymore. Unfortunate, really.~~

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well this was awful. USDCAD continued on a rampage upward and I was
caught on the wrong side of the fence. Total loss for this was 0.12% of
my account. At least I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">was light in it</a>. In retrospect, I broke my
own rule and didn't enter at one of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">4 fundamental entry points</a>.
However, after some bear rampage throughout the markets today
(Bloomberg: [Stocks Plunge on Concern Rising Debt, Job Losses Threaten
Global Recovery][]), USDCAD is at the top of my channel as shown in
Figure 1 below. So while my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">previous entry</a>
was early. USDCAD at this price is a good short. I will take it slow
this time by setting a limit order below current support on the 4-hour
at 1.0680, with a stop at 1.0750. And then adding a second chunk at
1.0640, my stopped out price. As is customarily lately, I am only
risking 0.1% of my account on the initial order. On a weekly chart,
1.0750 to 1.0810 is obviously a strong resistance for the USDCAD. It is
a congestion zone in 2007 and 2008. Then USDCAD spent the last quarter
of 2009 trying to break this resistance to no avail. But who knows,
perhaps USDCAD has had enough and it will break this resistance
decisively soon. That's why I'm only betting on this reversal with
limited risk. It's just a matter of wait and see now.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Sometimes, things in life will get in the way of your trading. From down
with a cold to your internet service provider acting up, there are times
when your are not able to trade in your ideal zone. What do you do in
these disadvantaged circumstances? Do you take some NyQuil or whip out
your Blackberry, and then continue trading? This decision certainly
depends on the severity of your handicap and your trading
responsibility. If you have a massive open position with no stop, you'd
better suck it up and do something about it quick. For amateurs such as
myself with nobody to answer to but my own account, I would scale out of
my positions and then stop trading to focus on fixing my obstacle. I am
faced with this question recently and here's what I'm doing about it. I
have been practicing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> forex for the past few months
working out some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading signals</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">strategies</a> before going
live. During this time, I have become very fond of the 3-hour chart. My
strategy essentially boils down to making high-level decisions on the
weekly and daily charts, then executing my trades on the 3-hour and
1-hour charts. I've written specifically about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">my basic setup</a> and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">how I scale into a trade on the 3-hour timeframe</a>. This latter
technique, along with managing my stops, are the basis of my risk
management. So imagine the disruption to my perfect world when I was
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/barred-from-trading-at-work-a-curse-or-a-gift/">barred from trading at my day job</a> last month. The first step I took
is to adapt my trading strategy. I tried trading a longer timeframe so
that I don't have to move my orders every few hours. But the inability
to limit my risks is really getting to me. That was the best part of my
trading system and now I can't use it anymore. This is one big hole into
my trading strategy. So rather than continue on trading with a handicap,
I've decided to cast my trading aside to focus on remedying this problem
as soon as possible. Here are my 2 reasons for it.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are always opportunities in the market.</li>
<li>There is no handicap system in trading.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since my best trading system is effectively broken at this point, I
cannot perform as well as I should. Rather than compete with the rest of
the world in a handicapped state, it's better for me to ease back on
trading to put my effort to fixing my shortcomings. The longer I delay,
the more my demo account would be unnecessary exposed. In fact,
continuing to trade full force with a handicap would just be reckless
and arrogant. I am <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">just scrapping by</a> when I'm well. I can't imagine
how deep my drawdown would be if I trade without my best technique. Here
is my trading plan for the next few weeks. I will trade another strategy
using a longer timeframe. I will limit my risks and focus by holding at
most 2 positions at a time with maximum of 0.2% of account at risk for
each. The majority (about 70%) of my usual trading time will be spent on
learning <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/MQL4/">MQL 4</a> and developing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated risk management systems</a>.
That's the story of my problem and solution. What do you do when life
gets in your way of trading?</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Taking a first position in USD/CAD short here at 1.0573 on a 4-hour
moving averages cross-over (Figure 1). I've also placed a limit order to
add more at 1.0519 below Fibonacci support (shown in Figure 1). Reason
for this trade is that USD/CAD is moving away from an upper bound
channel with a overbought stochastic reading, as shown in the daily
chart of Figure 2. I've also considered going long AUD/USD, but AUD/CAD
trend remains bearish. So I chose to short USD/CAD instead. Secondly,
crude oil (and gold too) looks to be bouncing off an oversold level with
a rapid move in 2 days from 72.43 to 77.39. Coincidentally, INO.com
posted an intermediate term <a href="http://www.ino.com/info/513/CD4184/&amp;dp=0&amp;l=0&amp;campaignid=3">cyclical analysis video with a bullish
outlook</a> (affiliate link). They put out a better case than I do.
USD/CAD might make a short-term upward bounce here because of a
short-term oversold condition. However, there's evidently a lack of
buyers in the past few hours (Fig. 1). The price has been sitting on
support a bit too long in my view. Thus, I'm expecting it to break
without a meaningful retracement (hence the short entry). A confirmation
would be a break below 1.0530. Thus I have a limit order to short more
below that price. I am risking 0.1% of my account on this trade. As you
may have noticed, these charts are from Metatrader. I'm switching over
to the MT4 platform as of today. Having played with its charting
features for the past few hours, I'm quite satisfied with it so far.
Although my needs are low as I was fine with the Oanda platform too
(arguably the most simplistic platform out there). [caption id=""
