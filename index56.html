            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>CAD/JPY failed a major resistance level at 90 and has edged out an
obvious intermediate-term downtrend (Fig 1). USD/CAD is also bouncing
off a major support at 1.0200 (Fig. 2). And crude oil is below \$80 on a
slippery slope. As such, shorting loonie seems like a good move at the
moment according to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC trading setup</a>. Yet, here is why I am
opting to short CAD/JPY and not long the more popular USD/CAD currency
pair. Figure 3 shows a 5-year, weekly chart of CAD/JPY (top) and USD/CAD
(bottom). Evidently, the exchange rate of CAD/JPY is still in a
depressed mode since the fall of September 2008. It's also clear on this
chart that why I say 90 is a major resistance level. Beside from being a
nice round number, CAD/JPY has failed to break above 90 twice since
August 2009. As for USD/CAD, the picture isn't as clear. 1.0200 is
definitely a very strong support because it marks the top of a 6-month
range in the first half of 2008. Yet, the downward slope in the long
term since 2005 is not to be ignored. As such, I do not dare to bet on a
bounce on this pair at this price. Moreover, the intermediate-term move
on both of these pair is giving us a confirmation. CAD/JPY is now
testing a falling trendling (Fig. 1). Whereas USD/CAD is testing a
falling support. Thus, I am shorting CAD/JPY under pressure. Going long
on USD/CAD now would be like betting it to bounce on a slippery slope.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
I write this as I am in my [first trading drawdown of 2010][]. As I said
[previously][first trading drawdown of 2010], I find that I am still
ill-trained to respond to big drawdowns. I caught myself over trading
again hoping to rake in a few quick paper bucks in my demo account to
get myself out. However, the ability to maintain discipline and
performance under stress is what separate the pros from newbies like me.
I know what I must do at the back of my head but I took the easy way.
This trading drawdown is definitely bringing the worst trader in me. As
Dr. Steenbarger wrote in his post on [Stress and Performance in
Trading][],

> "... one reason stress might affect performance among traders is by
> skewing their assessments of risk and reward. Under pressure, traders
> may narrow their cognitive scope to only the information most salient
> to them (availability bias) or relevant to their expectations
> (confirmation bias); focus only on superficial qualities of
> observations (representativeness heuristic); or become more likely to
> take profits than losses (disposition effect). In other words, stress
> disrupts performance by altering normal, sound information
> processing."

In addition to a narrowed mindset, the cause of my bad habit to over
trade during a big drawdown is that I subconciously associate the need
to recover my account balance with the need to trade. Nothing will
happen if you don't trade, right? Well, at least you won't lose anymore
than you have. That would have been a good start. So I considered to
ease back on trading by focusing on [my quant work][]. Then I realized
this is yet another misconception. I was merely walking away from my
problem. What I needed to do is to face it, not with mindless trading
though. **During a stressful drawdown, work harder and think plenty
about the market, *not* about recovering from your drawdown**. In the
mean time, only trade your best strategy to reap the best probability of
profits. At the end of the day, nobody can dig yourself out of an
account drawdown but you. Something must have been wrong with your
trading or your current perception of the market to get you in a
drawdown. Or, it could very well be just plain old bad luck. In any
case, take a step back from trading and use the opportunity to realign
yourself with the market or wait for market conditions to sync back with
you. This is a forgotten lesson that I have wrote about in a [previous
drawdown][]. I have since added an additional section in my [trading
rules][] to impose it upon myself with this re-ocurring problem. I can
never get rid of large drawdowns completely because they are a regular
part of trading. This particular one has been a great self-discovering
experience. Ultimately, learning to cope with trading under stress is
one of my top training priorities to achieve before moving on to trading
a live account with real money.

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am close to passing my biggest monthly drawdown ever in my forex
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> endeavour. My account drawdown is at -3.34% now. My
record was set in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/november-2009-trading-performance-review/">last November</a> at -3.44%. And it's only the 13th!
To make matters worse, this isn't one of those transient, surprise
drawdown. It is a slow and steady one. An excruciating one. See Figure 1
for my account balance graph for this month so far. Feel my pain! My
post earlier this month on [10 questions to ask yourself if you are
holding a ginormous losing position and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what
to do][] was a real harbinger. I wrote that piece at precisely the top
point on Figure 1. If only I can time my trades that well! But instead
of a single ginormous losing position, I am faced with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">losing trades</a>
one after another. Thus, drastic measures need to be taken before I mark
a new drawdown record. This post is a self-assessment on what I've done
wrong and my plan to turn this wreck around. <!--more--> [caption id=""
align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="January 13 account
balance"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-13-account_balance.png" />][][/caption] Upon review of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>, it is
apparent that my account suffered because I was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/early-bird-does-not-get-the-worm-in-forex-trading/">too eager in shorting
the Aussie</a>. As a standard <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a> procedure, I kick
started my emergency protocol when my drawdown reached 3.00% last week
as I <a href="http://twitter.com/Quantisan/statuses/7522778269">tweeted</a>. Basically just reducing my risk by trading with only
half the usual position size. That was all last week. This week, I found
myself breaking another of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">trading rules</a>. I am letting this
drawdown affect my trading, in a bad way. Specifically, I am letting my
need to perform affect me by starting to day trade the GBPJPY currency
pair! If you might recall from last year, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-example-of-how-trading-in-fear-is-bad-for-your-account/">resorted to the same
desperate measure</a> (isn't it great to be able to recall my past
trading experience just like that?) and that was the month when I had
the largest drawdown. Exactly because of that. In fact, the drawdown
emergency rules posted last time are as appropriate as ever. Heck, I
will copy and paste these rules in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules/">3 rules of trading</a> as a
permanent fixture. I seem to need them quite often. I can't helped but
feel chagrined with the fact that my current situation yields itself to
a perfect follow-up to my previous post on trading drawdown. However,
this is what it is. In my next post, I will examine why I keep going
back to this same bad habit of day trading (even though I suck at it)
when I am under pressure.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Gold price made a 15 point jump over the weekend to 1160 and is
consolidating now (Fig. 1). Crude oil tested 84 and is back down to just
above 83 now. Yet, AUDCAD is still struggling to break above 9600 (Fig.
2). You would have thought that AUDCAD should mustered enough momentum
to break above this key resistance with all these gold bullishness and
oil bearishness. Thus, I am giving this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audcad-0-9489-stop-9540/">AUDCAD short setup as described
previously</a> another try. I am only risking 0.16% on this trade. It is
half of my usual initial entry. First because it is a FTR (reversal)
setup and second because I am in a 3% drawdown. So my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk
manaegment</a> rules dictate that I trade halved size. This setup is
according to the monthly and weekly chart, so it could take a while, and
probably more tries, before it shows its hands. I will keep shorting it
as long as it's below 9600 on the weekly. Limited by the amount at risk
according to my risk management rules, of course!</p>
