    </h1>

    <div class='article-content'>
        <p>Parity, parity, parity. That's all I hear about in Canada these days.
The <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-13/loonie-approaches-parity-on-bets-central-bank-to-increase-rates.html">media is saying</a> (Businessweek) that the strength in loonie is
due to a higher than expected inflation data and so a possible rise in
our interest rate by the Bank of Canada this year is in the cards. But
that's just part of the story. As I was saying in my previous post,
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-should-i-care-about-other-markets-if-i-only-trade-___/">markets don't operate in a vacuum</a>. The biggest news so far this year
on the global economy is the Greece bailout. Or more specifically, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2010/03/18/is-there-a-greece-bailout/">is
there a bailout</a> (WSJ) and <em>by whom</em>? Greece is the 27th biggest
economy according to Wikipedia. Their GDP is 24% of Canada's. They are
by no means a small country. A default of this magnitude would have a
domino effect on the weak PIGS (Portugal, Ireland/Italy, Greece and
Spain) countries and beyond. Traders will lose confidence if Greece is
not saved. Then everyone will unload their holdings in those PIGS
countries and massive selling will drive their markets even further
down. A vicious cycle of downward spiral is thus formed in the short
term. Given that even a small time trader such as myself is aware of the
grim consequence, it is likely that Greece will be saved. So the next
question is, by whom? That is the big question which is still up in the
air and fiercely debated this month. The two candidates are the European
Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As far as
we know, the ECB doesn't seem to want to take the burden upon itself.
The European Union isn't doing exactly well lately, in case you haven't
noticed. Its best performing country, Germany, doesn't want to penalize
their hardworking taxpayers for <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?countryName=Greece&amp;countryCode=gr&amp;regionCode=eu#2116">the mistakes of Greece</a> (CIA World
Factbook). So that leaves the IMF, the last line of defense for troubled
economies. If the IMF bails out Greece, that means the United States is
on the hook too as they are the biggest economy and backer of the IMF.
Europe's problem will become an American problem too. More bailouts for
the U.S. means more spending. Having spent <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">trillions already pumping up
the financial markets</a> (U.S. debt clock) in the past couple of years,
this would tank the U.S. dollar into the abyss. Likewise, if the ECB
confirms that they will contain the problem and that IMF isn't involved.
The Euros will tank and the dollar will rise. But that's just guess work
for now. The one thing that's for sure is that a massive amount of money
will be spent to save Greece. Excessive money means inflation and higher
cost of commodities in the long run. Seeing that the Canadian market is
heavily commodity-related and that our loonie is even known as a
commodity currency, that is the reason behind why inflation is rising
fast and our economy is being propped up. Not necessarily because we are
doing terrific, but because we are sitting on a pile of gold and oil.
Real, tangible wealth in any kind of economy.</p>
