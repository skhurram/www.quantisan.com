            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Having had <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-bad-eurusd-day-trading-and-what-to-do-about-it/">a hard time day trading the EUR/USD last week</a>, things
haven't been well for me this week either with the market in a gridlock.
My one and only viable setup so far is <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">built for a trending market</a>.
So this range-bound market is new territory for me as I experiment (in
hindsight, haphazardly) to come up with more profitable forex trading
setups. As you can imagine, trading without discipline is a recipe for
diaster. I have given back all the paper gain from this month by the
start of this week and is treading on thin ice with my demo account
dipping dangerously close to the November opening balance. Needless to
say, I do not want to see my account in the red for this month. But that
is what happened after today's string of failed trades. I am officially
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">in the red for this month</a>, for now. While there are several mistakes
I made resulting in this mess, I think it all boils down to one flaw in
my trading this week. Yes, those day trading stints I did surely have
put a dent in my demo account, but what's worse is that I've
unconsciously have let those losses affect my trading mentality. These
losses were stuck in my mind and my mental "goal" for this week was
recovering from them. However, I have approached the problem in the
wrong way by not wanting to lose anymore in my account. In other words,
I was afraid of losing. So how did that materially affect my trading?
Here is a simple example as illustrated in my order history on the
GBP/JPY chart attached at the bottom of this post. The 3 yellow
triangles are my short entries and the 3 red dots marks the stopped
exits. According to my setup, my original entry at 149.50 had a stop at
150.50. But I moved my stop closer to 149.80 in the morning because I
didn't want to risk more. That got taken out easily as 149.80 is within
the congestion zone. Then I tried to short it a couple more times with
tight stops because I see the downside potential to be still intact.
Those were eaten up alive too and now I don't have a position because it
would have been more foolish to keep trying in vain. While just 3 trades
wouldn't have done much damage, I was doing the same thing across the
board in shorting CAD/JPY and EUR/CAD. A few here and a few there. They
add up to a bad day. As of this writing, it looks like these pairs are
finally moving in my direction. But instead of being patient with
reasonable stops, I thought I could do better and micro-managed my
positions to end up taking multiple small losses and with nothing left
on the table to ride the move. So what is the correct way of following
up on a dent in the account? I should have done the following instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce risk exposure by limiting trade size or overall opened
    positions until I am back up.</li>
<li>Focus on what I did wrong last week and stop doing that, i.e. no
    more day trading.</li>
<li>Recall my best trades and do more of that, i.e. my one and only
    finalized setup, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not so coincidentally, now that I'm in the deepest drawdown ever, this
is as good as ever to put this emergency recovery procedure into
practice.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've stayed home from work this week because of the flu. So with spare
time on my hands, I had the urge to experiment with day trading the
forex market. Bad decision. After a good 3-4 days of day trading EUR/USD
with my demo account, here is what I have to show as illustrated in my
account balance graph for the past 4 trading sessions below.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Account balance
Nov 10-14, 2009"][<img alt="Account balance Nov 10-14, 2009" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-14-account_balance.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-14-account_balance.png">Account balance
Nov 10-14, 2009</a>[/caption] Yes, you can push back up your dropped jaw
now. I considered not accounting for these losses in my paper trading
account because these trades were meant to be experimental only.
However, as the whole point of me paper trading the forex is to learn
and improve, I decided to keep these losses and suffer the consequences
of my own doing. Heck, I wouldn't have had the choice if this were real
money (which is the way that I should treat this demo account anyway). I
stepped out of my circle of strength (swing trading) into something that
has burned me many times before. Well guess what, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/1000-in-2-days/">history does repeat
itself</a>. Enough with lambasting myself. The real focus of this post is
to point out what I did wrong and what can I do to improve in day
trading the forex. Not that I'm intent on day trading though. This is
merely to increase my arsenal in forex trading. Figuring out what I did
wrong is actually obvious in hindsight. Figure 2 below depicts the
trades I made on Nov 13, which led to most of that steady decline in my
account balance as shown in Fig. 1. See the bounce from about 1.4820? I
kept shorting it and shorting it all the way up to 1.4880. What was I
thinking? The main reason for this epic failure is that I broke a
fundamental rule in trading. <strong>Trade what you see and what you thought</strong>
(Techniques of Tape Reading by <a href="http://www.realitytrader.com/blog/">V. Graifer</a>). Based on the previous
day's market sell-off from 1.5000 and the Asian markets failing to break
1.4900, I thought the market would follow through on Friday and break
through this 1.4820 support. In particular, just before NY open before
9:30am, EUR/USD had a couple of big drops, as shown in Fig. 2. All these
circumstances led to my believe that we'll see a weak day like
yesterday.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EUR/USD,
5m"][<img alt="EUR/USD, 5m" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_5m.PNG" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_5m.PNG">EUR/USD, 5m</a>[/caption] However, a support is
still a support until it's broken. I shouldn't keep shorting it even
though it has obviously bounced. While identifying the trend is trivial
in hindsight, what evidence did I have at the time to tell me that? The
evidence was in fact staring me in the face that morning. Figure 3 shows
part of the screen that I usually use for intra-day observation. As you
can see, S&amp;P500 rejected the previous day's close with a strong negative
TICK reading and then broke above the morning range. The TICK also
remained strong with many +800 readings in the morning. All the classic
signs that point to a strong positive trend.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="577" caption="intraday
sentiment"]<img alt="intraday sentiment" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-intraday_am.PNG" />[/caption] Furthermore, if only I had
stepped back and observed the bigger picture, as shown in Fig. 4 with a
30-minute chart, I would have seen that we have a great positive
divergence swing setup (and which I normally would have exploited if I
weren't so focused on trading the 5m that day).</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EUR/USD,
30-minute"][<img alt="EUR/USD, 30-minute" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_30m.PNG" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_30m.PNG">EUR/USD, 30-minute</a>[/caption] What
is my goal in future day trading? Instead of a declining equity curve as
in Figure 1, just flip it up-side-down and that's what would be perfect.
All I needed to change is being able to spot the right trend and ride
it. Easier said than done. So what is the moral of this story? I have
once again proven that I am still no good at day trading. Stick with
swing trades.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>A profitable trade is definitely a good thing. But when you sit idly to
see good profits turn into great profits, and then doing nothing to lock
in some of that windfall, it is time to review your trading strategy.
That is exactly what I have done last night when I saw my AUD/JPY shorts
took a 150 pips dive at the Sydney open to pass a strong support. And it
wasn't AUD/JPY only, all my 4 other pairs also pushed about 100 pips
deeper into the green to test their respective supports. But as quickly
as those unrealized profits appeared, it was quicker that they
evaporated. While I had <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">5 positions</a> last night and they all fit this
scenario, I will use my AUD/JPY short for this particular case study as
it was the most dramatic and easy to read. Here is a brief summary of my
AUD/JPY shorts. Figure 1 is a 3-hour chart of AUD/JPY showing my entries
and exits. I entered twice on Oct 29 (83.76 and 82.47, marked by yellow
triangles) and was stopped out with profits on Oct 31 and Nov 2 (81.7
and 81, marked by red dots). The trades ended up +147 and +206 pips with
1/2 the position size each. As shown in Figure 1, I did manage to
capture most of the down move nonetheless. So these weren't badly
executed at all. (I used my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">FTCS 0.1</a> as the trading setup, so I
won't go into the logic behind my entries and exits here.) What I'd like
to point out though is the long tail candlestick poking through the
support at 80.0. From Figure 2 daily chart, it is apparent that 80.0 for
AUD/JPY is a strong support from prior congestions. Not to mention that
it's a nice whole number. As such, it was naive of me to think that
AUD/JPY could break and maintain this depressed level on thin volume on
a Sunday (EST) Sydney open. Secondly, also note that in Figure 2, the
fall in price of AUD/JPY is quite extended as shown by the RSI's dive
from 90+ to about 40. Even if the pair is poised for further weakness,
there's bound to be some catch of breath before it can take on a strong
support. From the above 2 observations, which I did see at the time,
it's evident that I should have taken some profits (i.e. half of my
positions) when I had the chance. I knew in my mind that 80.0 was hard
to break, but instead of exiting on target, I merely tightened my stops
in hoping for more gains. Don't get me wrong. Using stops for entries
and exits have served me well and it will still remain my primary trade
order method. But if I'm to improve, to go from +200 pips to +300 pips
in a trade, I need to be able to spot and exploit other tools at my
disposal when extraordinary occasions such as last night's appear. So
what can I do in the future to prevent this from happening again? With 2
simple additions to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading strategy</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a profit target and take some chips off when the market reaches
    target at extreme conditions.</li>
<li>Keep these profit targets up-to-date according to the trading setup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that this is analogous to what I have already been doing with my
stops by moving them closeras the price action dictates. However, <strong>one
important caveat</strong> to this technique is that this should never override
the fundamental trading rule of letting profits run. I will only take
profits at a target if the price is severely over-extended according to
my trading setup. In any case, as [Ancient_Warrior][] wrote to me on
<a href="http://twitter.com/Quantisan">Twitter</a>, "<span><span>Well don't 'kick yourself' too much for 200
pip gains please! lol"</span></span></p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>October is the first full month in which I traded forex. Naturally, this
is the first of my monthly trading performance review. Note that all the
trades were on a demo account with imaginary money only. But I still
took this seriously. My goal is to double this demo account starting
from CAD\$5000. Once that is accomplished, I will start live trading
with real money. Who knows how long this might take. Hopefully by then,
I will have a respectable set of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setups</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">strategies</a>, and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools">quant tools</a> developed. Anyway, let's get on with the monthly review.
As this is only my first month trading currencies after spending 8 years
in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/stocks/">stocks</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures</a>, my trading this month is marked by a lot
of experimentation. As can be seen in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trading log</a>, I performed
abysmally for the first couple of weeks. The last of my bad string ended
when I took an uncalled for trade <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-undisciplined-trade-shorted-eurusd-1-499-stopped-1-505-62-pips/">based on what I thought rather than
what I saw</a>. Not all is lost this month as I managed to write out the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">first of my forex trading setups</a> from the trials and errors. Since
then, I had a string of winners to push my monthly tally deeper into the
positive. While this is definitely good, I am cautious and doubtful to
my initial success because I am just at the right place, at the right
time. Because we might very well be witnessing the printing of the top
from this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/inter-market-analysis-after-a-new-2009-high-in-the-equity-market/">epic V-shaped rally since March</a>. The moves in the markets
were very strong and very rapid this last week. I just happen to be on
the right side of the trades.</p>
<h2>Performance Statistics Review</h2>
<p>In any case, I'll get down to business with discussing the performance
statistics below. On first sight, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio">Sharpe ratio</a> at 5.25 is
impressive for this month. However, looking a few lines below, see that
if we account for only the middle 90th percentile profits and losses,
the net profit is reduced by a magnitude. (So as to see what would
happen if we truncate the biggest (un)lucky wins and losses.) That means
much of my profit for this month was because of a few big trade. In
fact, it was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-eurjpy-135-00-500-1-pips/">this lucky trade when I made +500 pips</a> in one week.</p>
<h2>Goal for Next Month</h2>
<p>What I've learned from analyzing these numbers is that I lack
consistency (like all new traders), and was perhaps just lucky. So the
goals for the coming months are simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>achieve consistency by bringing up this mid 90% net profit value;
    and</li>
<li>maintain good Sharpe ratio rating by improving my risk management
    techniques.</li>
</ol>
