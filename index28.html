            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Choosing a discount broker for forex trading is time consuming. As the
forex market is not centralized, choosing a discount broker is sort of
like picking a stall in a farmer's market. They all offer the same
product, but prices, features, quality, and services can vary
considerably between fx brokerages. One criteria that I consider
seriously is the Application Programming Interface (API) offered by the
broker. Most people couldn't care less about API because they never
intend to develop their own automated trading program. However, if this
is something that interests you, then I'd like to save you some time
here with the following table.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Forex brokers

I highlighted the important limitation of each API. I have different
level of experience with each of these six APIs. As of this writing, I
am using <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/jforex/">JForex</a> from <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/in-a-forex-brokers-and-trading-platforms-jumble/">various personal reasons</a>.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am building my real JForex automated trading system one feature at a
time. The idea is to automate some of my most fundamental trading
techniques on JForex so that I can trade forex semi-automatically on
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a>. I am starting off here with a simple stop management
strategy. In a nutshell, once the market price moves in your favour
equidistant from your original stop loss, this strategy moves the stop
to breakeven. For example, if I go long EURUSD at 1.3500 with a stop at
1.3400 (100 pips stop). Then if the price breaks above 1.3600 (100 pips
profit), the strategy moves the stop to breakeven. This is a simplistic
implementation of the saying that "never let profits turn into losses".
You can <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6028806/StopManager.java">download the source code here</a> and the <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6028806/StopManager.jfx">executable strategy
here</a>. Note that these files are made available through <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTYwMjg4MDY5/">Dropbox</a>.

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is an explanation of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading</a> strategy for the
Dukascopy JForex Strategy Contest in April. This strategy just made its
first trade today after running for about 72 hours. My contest demo
account closed with a gain of 7% on this first trade. Note that this
strategy is built for competing in a contest and not for real trading
(i.e., it's purely a no cost gamble). Here is the concept for this high
probability trading setup. Referring to Figure 1 below, the red arrow
marks my short entry on EURGBP today. These are the technical analysis
indicators the strategy uses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend: Signaled by 50 bar moving average above (bullish) or below
    (bearish) the 200 bar moving average.</li>
<li>Momentum: Oversold or overbought RSI conditions, but not used in a
    traditional manner...</li>
<li>Volatility: I use the Keltner channel to measure volatility.</li>
<li>Price action: Observe candlestick behaviour to identify trend
    continuation. This is where the secret to this strategy happens. I
    will explain this below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that I used a Bollinger Bands in the chart of Figure 1 because I
couldn't find the Keltner Channel indicator in Metatrader (my charting
software). It doesn't affect my conceptual illustration anyhow. The
setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify overarching trend via 50/200 moving averages as explained
    above.</li>
<li>Confirm price is still playing to the trend by checking if current
    market price is on the right side of the 200 bars moving average.
    Price above for bullish and below for bearish.</li>
<li>Once steps 1-2 are in place, it's assumed that the trend is strong.
    We look for a setup in the trend's direction. In particular, we look
    for a <em>failed counter-trend retracement</em> setup using candlestick in
    combination with the Keltner channel.</li>
<li>Sounds fancy but it's simple. Using a short-side example, the bar's
    high has to penetrate above the Keltner channel yet it closes within
    it. Then the short entry is signaled. The opposite for a long-side
    entry.</li>
<li>RSI overbought and oversold conditions are used to filter out slow
    and steady counter-trend moves (those are evil).</li>
</ol>
<p>Another benefit of using a price channel is that I also use it to peg my
take profit target and stop loss. As I said in my previous post, because
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> expects winning contestants to submit their source codes,
I am not using anything proprietary or extraordinary here. As such, this
is totally different than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">what I use to trade on my own</a>. Namely more
reliance on indicators and less on price action and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p><strong>Update</strong>: I have since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">won the JForex strategy contest a few
times</a>. If you are looking to learn JForex programming, you can start
with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-multiple-time-frame-strategy/">an explanation of my winning strategy</a> and my long <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/jforex/">list of
JForex posts</a>. The Dukascopy JForex Strategy Contest began last week.
Starting this month, <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> offers \$15,000 total of cash prizes
to the top 10 automated trading systems every month. However, before
entering, there are a couple of clauses in their contest rules that
caught my attention.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cash prizes are deposited into contestant's Dukascopy account
    (Ranking and Awarding Rules #5).</li>
<li>All source code needs to be submitted and agrees to be published
    (Ranking and Awarding Rules #2 and #6).</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 is troublesome because it means winners have to <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">open an account
with Dukascopy</a> if they don't already have an account with
them. But that isn't a big deal since they are actually one of the best
forex brokers. I planned to open an account with them anyway. However,
#2 will certainly turn many people away. The requirement to disclose
source code in an automated trading contest is almost unheard of as far
as I know. Are you willing to disclose your winning system just for that
few hundred, or a even few thousand, dollars of prize money? In any
case, I decided to enter this contest anyway just for fun. Yet, you can
be sure that I won't be using any proprietary logic in my system. In
fact, I just finished my automated trading strategy today and it is now
running. I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/">discuss about my strategy</a> after it completes its
first trade. That might take a while as my system is expected to make
fewer than 5 trades in a month.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am disgusted by the blatant milking of investor money happening in the
stock market. Case in point, just look at the media coverage of Research
in Motion (RM.TO) before and after their earnings release yesterday. It
was just days ago when investment firms were going gaga over Research in
Motion (RM.TO). See table below for the accolade of buy recommendations.
Globe and Mail even posted the following article the day before earnings
release, "<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/expectations-high-as-rim-set-to-report/article1517857/">Expectations high as RIM set to report</a>". Then immediately
after RIM's earnings release yesterday, which was after the market close
(when only the big banks and brokers can trade amongst themselves),
headlines such Globe and Mail's "<a href="http://www.google.ca/url?q=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/rim-profit-short-of-expectations/article1519081/&amp;ei=3qa0S7qdBoWdlgeAvuhU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=news_article&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDQQqQIoAjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsvQ_j9Nk2sqDxf-40LQLxo_QGNA">RIM profit short of
expectations</a>ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â½" pops up all over the news wire. Goldman
Sachs even <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2010/04/01/rim-reactions-goldman-downgrades-to-sell/?mod=yahoo_hs">promptly downgraded RIM to a SELL</a>. Citing concerns from
Apple, Google, etc. As if the world around RIM suddenly changed within
minutes before and after their latest earnings! Not surprisingly, RIM
(on Nasdaq) traded -5% post-market last night and gapped down big today.
Anyone that bought into these sales pitch (see table) just days ago
would have been hit hard. This type of <strong>orchestrated raids</strong> from the
media and big investment firms never cease to disgust me. That is a
reason why I've taken to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">learn to trade</a> and not invest with a
buy-and-pray mentality.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>It is that time of the month again when I do my trading performance
review. However, I did not make any trade this month. Not because I was
procrastinating, but I spent all of my time this month to work on my
quantitative projects. This review will be a recap of my backend trading
development. I said in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/february-2010-trading-performance-review/">last month's performance review</a> that my
goal for March is "to write a rudimentary data analysis and
visualization program for historical forex data." Well, I finished <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/data-scraping-the-toronto-stock-exchange-extracting-3660-companies-data/">half
of it</a> and then realized that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/from-object-oriented-programming-to-object-oriented-design/">I need a better design for the
software</a>. So I studied yet another programming book (finished 3
programming books this month), on object oriented design and analysis.
The other major event for me this month is that I finally opened a
self-directed RRSP account at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> because the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/considering-investment-options-for-my-first-rrsp/">tax benefit is
too good to pass</a>. Consequently, I am starting to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-first-analysis-of-the-sptsx-60-index/">study the Canadian
stock market</a> for trading with a conservative, intermediate-term
manner (not buy and hold though). Lastly, it seems that I might be back
to trading forex sooner than I have thought. I signed up for an
automated trading contest at <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143">Dukascopy</a> earlier this week. Since they
are offering a cash prize, I thought I might as well reschedule and work
on my forex stuff now. I will write more on this topic at another time.</p> </div>
