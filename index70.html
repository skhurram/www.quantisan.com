            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
I seem to have taken up too many tasks in recent weeks. I've spent a
couple hours a day analysing, observing, and trading the [forex
market][]. Another hour or so learning RapidMiner 5. And then yet
another couple of hours catching up with the news and various blogs. All
these on top of a full time job! It has come to my attention that I
can't keep this up as I'll be too burned-out and never actually able to
get things done. Such is the bane of choices. Coincidentally, I read
this blog post today (via [TraderFeed][]) about the [paradox of
choices][]. It is basically saying that having choices, per se, can have
a diminishing rate of return (something which I've read elsewhere before
but forgotten). More choices isn't always good and fewer can be better.
And studies have found that the diminishing rate is apparently pretty
low. Here's a good quote from the article:

> "we need to redirect the energies we waste flitting from possibility
> to possibility, into understanding what we really want in life and the
> trade-offs we are willing to make."

Particularly at this early stage of my amateur quant career, there are
many trading tools (analyzer, forecaster, scanner) that I want to
develop and software ([MatLab][], RapidMiner) that I want to learn. So
what do I really want in trading by spending hours upon hours, day after
day, studying, analysing, observing, and thinking? The answer for me is
fortunately easy to find (the benefit of keeping a good written record,
i.e. this blog). Referring to my own [trading objectives][] that I wrote
last year, there is just 5 points.

1.  Application of independent and objective thinking
2.  [Understanding of capital markets][]
3.  Prudent [risk management][]
4.  Identification of [values][]
5.  Study of [quantitative finance][]

In practical terms, **my ultimate goal in trading is to develop a
trading system which requires no more than 1 hour a day of management
time**. That doesn't include research and development time, of course. I
am not trying to develop a holy grail system. I am using the term system
as in a set of processes for me to follow, not an algorithmic system.
Although that would be a tool for my system for sure. Now that I've
figure that out. My first mandate is to reduce my [paper trading][] in
forex. But rather than eliminate it completely, I'm going to increase
the timeframe from 4 hour to daily. Because trading the forex helps me
understand the capital markets (\#2 of objective). Too much of it though
would have been just for thrill and detract from my time for working in
quantitative finance (\#5). If I'm to treat this as a part-time job, I
need to have more discipline in this whole endeavour, not just in the
trading itself.

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My long USD/CHF got stopped out just minutes ago.  The support at 1.0300
has broken.  The intermediate and short term trends are both down.  So I
have entered a short trade for USD/CHF with 1/2 position to see how it
goes.</p>
<p>I initially had set the stop at 1.0340 for this trade.  But the support
at 1.0270 looks hard to break on first try.  So I readjusted my target
and stop to aim for an exit at 1.0270.  In fact, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve
placed an order to reverse and go long at 1.027 with a full position.</p>
<p>Entry: 1.0296, just below round number.</p>
<p>Stop: 1.0340, trailing, set at the previous congestion zone.</p>
<p>Target: 1.0270, previous support level.</p>
<p>Reward / Risk = 26 / 19 = 1.4 \&lt; 3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ this is horrible.  So
I just closed my trade at a slight loss at 1.03013 for -\$1.56.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>My last half of USD/CHF long just got stopped out @ 1.0300. As shown in
Figure 1, USD/CHF is now in bearish territory. I'm going to wait and see
if the support at 1.0300 can hold tonight. Here are the statistics for
my two trades (each 1/2 position counts as a trade): Entry: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdchf-entry-1-0320-stop-1-0300/">1.032</a>,
full position at 6000 units Stopped out: 1.03099 and 1.0300 Net Pips:
-10.10, -20 Net \$: -\$3.03, -\$6.01 Time Held: 32 minutes, 83 hours %
Drawdown: -0.10%, -0.19% % from Top: 0.30%, 0.61% In hindsight, I should
have paid more attention to the short term trend. The break of the
recent trendline should have been a warning sign against going long. As
I'm still trying to work out the details to this strategy, these paper
trades have been tremendously helpful.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My NZD/USD short at 0.72509 just before noon today got stopped out an
hour later at 0.72661. At least it was only a 1/2 position. I wanted to
short again when NZD/USD broke 0.7280 because of the resistance as shown
in Figure 1. However, remembering #1 in my newly updated <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">3 trading
rules</a>, I re-considered and held back. NZD/USD is testing 0.7300 at
this moment, so this rule is proving itself useful already. What's
interesting now is that as NZD/USD is testing 0.7300, both USD/CAD and
USD/CHF are well off the support levels of 1.0700 and 1.0300,
respectively. There's no particular reason for using these two pairs,
they are just two pairs that I've been following. Which seems to me that
the weakness is USD isn't as bad as it would seem. If it is, then US
dollar would be under pressure in all fronts. And it's not now. At least
not yet. Thus, not giving up on this nice setup as shown in Figure 1,
I've placed a short stop entry for 50% position just below the next
intraday support at 0.7262. Just to catch it on its way down from this
very obvious resistance level. In any case, here're my 5 reasons for
shorting based on Figure 1.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend is neutral</li>
<li>We're at the top of a trading range</li>
<li>Near resistance at long term Fib level and round number at 0.7300</li>
<li>Potential double top, although this is very uncertain</li>
<li>Little breathing room in recent climb up</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, here is my order: Size: Half position, 3000 units Side:
Short Stop entry: 0.7262 Stop exit: 0.7300, set to trail Target: 0.7132,
top of that uptrending line in Figure 1 Reward / Risk = 130 / 38 = 3.42
> 3 I'm pondering should I enter 50% position when NZD/USD is hanging
around 07290. But I think I'll hold it off since my USD/CHF is still
open. Update: My short entry was triggered for 0.72509 (horrible
spread). I was stopped out at 0.72661 an hour later for a net loss of
\$4.57. This was not a good trade because NZD/USD was so close to a
round number resistance that it was probable to test it.</p>
