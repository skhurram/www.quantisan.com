like to keep it as a core position if the market permits. That's why
I've been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/tck/">keeping an eye on TCK for a re-entry</a> since I cleared my
position a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>Upside: Figure 1, bouced at 20 day MA support. 20 day MA crossing over

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been stopped out of my -2.0 trailing stop placed just minutes ago
this morning. \$135 seems like a strong resistance for SKF. We barely
broke it this morning on decent volume. Furthermore, \$138 is a 50 day
MA and \$140 is a good round number resistance. In other words, there
are a few resistances to be broken going up from here.</p>
<p>Having <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-34-dug-2344-and-bought-10-skf-104125/">entered SKF at \$104 in the new year</a>, I am content with the
gain for this trade. It has exceeded my original short term target of
120.</p>
<p>However, I would watch SKF and see if it breaks below 130. If it can
stay above 130 today, then that's a very good sign.</p>

and still <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-34-dug-2344-and-bought-10-skf-104125/">held on to my short hedge</a>. So I was heavy on the short
side since the weekend.</p>
<p>We had the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/post-market-analysis-jan-7-2009/">first 2009 down day</a> on the market today. But SLW held on
to its support level and the last few minutes saw some heavy buying. So
I'm taking a small position in SLW to test the water. I will keep a
tight stop on this trade as my indicators are showing further downside.</p>
<p>In other words, the short term price action looked positive today but my
indicators are showing a negative move for the intermediate term.</p>

<p>Furthermore, silver prices seem to be edging higher. We just tested the
20 day MA again. Lately, silver has been gliding along its 20 day MA.
But we saw significant volume today on this test of support, so there's
a good chance we might break down from here. That's another reason why
I'm keeping a tight stop on this trade.</p>

<p>Upside: Tested 20 day MA. Good last few minute up trades. Both 20-day
and 50-day MA are positive.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$7</p>
<p>Downside: Indicators show intermediate-term weakness. Possible double
top with negative divergence.</p>
<p>Support: \$5.50. (This will be my mental stop for this trade.)</p>
<p>Bottom line: I'm adding a small long position here to balance my
portfolio. As of this writing, I am net neutral with my portfolio. The
idea is to have both feet in the water and then add to strength as the
market unfolds.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market tanked today after the holiday rally. The first 30 minute
today tagged the day as a down day. We started with a gap down, along
with the TICK sliding downward all morning. The real confirmation came
just before noon when the TICK broke above 1000 but the S&amp;P 500 failed
to break the 920 resistance. I knew we weren't going to close the gap
once the writing was on the wall.</p>

<p>Over the longer term, it's interesting to note that we tested the
November 28 high today. Based on the higher volume (versus Nov 28), it
seems we'll be able to break below it in the coming days. If that
happens, I'm staring right at 820 or so, around the middle of my down
channel and the 11/21 high as my target.</p>
<p>If we can bounce back from here though, I'm looking at the 11/04 low of
about 970 as my target.</p>

<p>What leads me to believe we're more likely to head lower at this point
is the obvious double top with negative divergences on the indicators
(figure below, pink trend line, lower right). We'll see how the market
performs tomorrow around this critical 900 level.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After holding SLW for a few weeks, I'm finally out for now. I have
traded in and out of SLW for the past few months. So there isn't an
exact price and date of entry for these 246 shares. The effective
purchase price was about \$3.50.</p>
<p>As I noted more than a few times in the past, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">I love SLW</a>. I intended
to hold it as my core position for the long term. However, as I have
learned the hard way, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/auto-bailout-shakeout-december-13-2008/">buy-and-hold isn't an effective strategy</a> in
the current market condition. So I've decided to sell my SLW on some
significant weakness.</p>
<p>From Figure 1, SLW has tested the long term resistance (from 2007) of
\$7 twice recently. We still haven't broken it despite <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2008-post-holiday-market-analysis/">S&amp;P 500 breaking
its own resistance</a>. Moreover, we can see from Figure 2 that this
second top is a lot weaker across the indicators. So this is effectively
a double top formation, for now.</p>
<p>I still have my reserve on this because it is a holiday week, so low
volume is expected. Thus, I would watch for SLW's action next week and
see if it can break \$7 and then get back in at a higher price. I'd
rather miss out on a \$1 or even \$2 than watch it make a double top. I
have nearly doubled on this trade so I'm just trying not to be greedy.</p>
<p>However, there is a possibility that we might gap up from here and
rocket higher next week. If that's the case, I will probably not chase
it and look for another trade (TCK looks good).</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>DUG broke my \$25 stop yesterday. I gave it some room because of the
recent \$6 / share distribution on Dec 22. So that effectively shifted
the chart by 6 points. However, the Crude Oil broke above it's 20-day MA
and is showing signs of strength, Figure 2. So I decided to get out of
DUG as my short hedge and move into SKF.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-34-dug-3000/">DUG shares were bought for \$30</a>. Distribution was \$6.06. So my
net lost per share on this trade is [(\$23.44 + \$6.06) - \$30] =
-\$0.5. Which is a total loss of \$0.5 * 34 = \$17 + \$10 commission.
It's basically a breakeven trade.</p>

<p>As I was saying, I replaced DUG with SKF as my short hedge. We are
testing the Oct support on SKF. Furthermore, despite the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2008-post-holiday-market-analysis/">S&amp;P breaking
above the down channel this week</a> and along with SKF's distribution,
SKF is still above the psychological 100 level.</p>

<p>Stop: \$96, the October support.</p>
<p>Target: \$120, a congestion zone.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is merely a short hedge play so I actualy don't hope
for big gains on this.</p> </div>
