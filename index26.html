            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update May 10: Looks like I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-illustration-of-what-it-means-by-missing-the-boat-in-trading/">missed the boat</a>. TCK.B gapped up almost
7% at the Monday open to \$38.88. I won't be chasing the market at this
point as the reward/risk ratio isn't appealing anymore. Update: I got
stopped out at breakeven (after commission) before I can post this piece
at the end of the day. I'm back to all cash going into the weekend. I am
taking a dip in Teck Resources (TCK/B.TO) with 110 shares bought at
\$36.03. This is a trade to "buy when everyone else is in fear".
Following my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-hell-and-back-a-review-of-tsx-after-a-v-day/">assessment of the market yesterday</a>, I don't think
things are that bad, yet. So I am establishing a small position in a
strong company today. TCK is trading on its 200 day moving average at
\$35 this week (Figure 1). Yesterday's epic dive and recovery didn't
break this \$35 support. So that's a very good sign for TCK.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Tech Resources
(TCK-B.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO.png" />][][/caption] Furthermore, \$35 is an obvious
psychological round number support. It is also above the recent low of
\$32.50 printed in February of this year as shown in Figure 1. The
oscillator value (top of Figure 1) is making a positive divergence as
TCK is testing this support level). I entered today based on the 5-day
intraday chart. This morning's opening hour test of \$35 support has
lower volume than earlier this week (Figure 2). As such, I think \$35
can hold. So I entered when the price shot above minor resistance at
\$36.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TCK-B.TO

drifted back under \$35.50 after I entered but then reversed and tested
\$37. I moved my stop loss to breakeven as it touched an equidistance
price opposite of my stop. Just so I don't see profits turn into losses.
If I get stopped out today, I will not re-enter until after the weekend.
My target is \$40 and original stop was \$35 for about a 4 to 1 reward
to risk ratio. I am risking 1.25% in this trade with a position size of
110 shares.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As every trader knows already, the Dow tanked 1,000 points (about 9%) in
like 15 minutes today. But what's more amazing is that all the indices
made their way back just as quickly. Figure 1 below is today's chart of
TSX Composite (blue) and S&amp;P 500 (red). So what does this mean for TSX?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-06-TSX-SPX.png"><img alt="TSX Composite and S&amp;P 500" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-06-TSX-SPX.png" /></a> Let's zoom
out to take a look at the big picture. Figure 2 is a weekly chart of
TSX. The top indicator is the percentage of TSX traded issues above
their 200 day moving average. The overlay indicator is the percentage of
TSX traded issues above their 50 day moving average. The lower indicator
is the percentage of issues above 200 MA divided by the percentage above
their 50 MA.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TSX
Composite"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-06-TSX-200-50.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>The TSX index is an aggregate of prices from a handful of companies. But
there are over three thousand issues trading on the TSX. This view of
Figure 2 provides another perspective of where the market stands.</p>
<p>The question to be answered is this, how much technical damage did
today's sell-off produce?</p>
<p>Not much apparently.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, both the 200 and 50 numbers are at their respective
support after the close. This is as low as we have been in the past 9
months or so. However, they are still hanging high above according to
the 200 percentage. There are still 56.5% of companies above their 200
day moving average.</p>
<p>On the shorter term though, the 50 number is pretty low at 30%. Only 30%
of companies are above their 50 day moving average.</p>
<p>Referring to the historical pattern as shown on Figure 2. Typically
numbers 30 or below means that the down move is exhausting. Since most
(70%) companies are trading low already, so there's not much room for
big dives until the market can reload. It is interesting that we touched
30% this week yet the TSX index is still not down that much in the big
picture.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I am still bearish on the market in the long run.
But I don't think today's move is the beginning of <em>the</em> dive. Since
volatility has contracted to a recent record low, this move is just a
shake-out of the bulls. Is this the end of this down move? I don't know.
But I expect to see at least an opposite shake-out of the bears soon
before any real move can materialize. Control your risks in expectation
of big ups and downs in the near future.</p>
<p>It's just too good to be true for the bears that the market makes a
U-turn and head straight down after congesting below a support level for
weeks.</p>
<p>In terms of my trading, I'm all cash today. So it was fun to watch the
move with no strings attached. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-12-cve-to-puts-2-90-mark-27-50-10-gain/">covered my CVE.TO shorts yesterday</a>
at a decent price. CVE.TO broke down further today during the panic but
ended up closing slightly higher. So my exit was good as I couldn't have
covered during that rapid breakdown.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) position this morning as crude
oil broke below \$80 briefly and the Dollar Index rose above \$84.
My[original target was \$27][] for this short. But considering the fact
that I mistakenly doubled my position size, I am closing this trade a
step above at this \$27.50 support level (see Figure 1 for CVE.TO
support lines). Furthermore, the time decay on the options premium is
accelerating so I needed to sell this soon. The final profit on this
position is \$858.15 (after \$63.80 commission), or just over 10% in my
RRSP account. Although this trade is profitable, it is a horrible trade
for the following reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>I accidentally <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-just-made-a-grave-fundamental-mistake-in-my-cve-to-trade/">bought more contracts when I intended to sell</a>.</li>
<li>Not correcting my mistake immediately.</li>
<li>I risked too much at 3% (of account) initially and then 10% after my
    mistake.</li>
<li>Peak drawdown was over \$1000 (12.5%) at one time.</li>
<li>Too eager to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-10jul17-puts-30-00-mx-2-45-mark-28-64/">add to my position once it moved</a>.</li>
<li>Reward-to-Risk ratio is less than 1.0, so I threw big money for
    smaller gain.</li>
<li>Commission ends up eating 7% of profit away. That is too much.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, I made one, two, ... seven too many mistakes in this
trade. Luckily, I did manage to do some things right.</p>
<ol>
<li>Patience. There were a few days when the price moved sideway. I
    didn't succumb to my emotions and dump the shares when it was nerve
    whacking to hold onto a loss. The price was still below my mental
    stop so I held.</li>
<li>After the initial shock of doubling my position as the price moved
    away, I mentally accepted my loss and was able to study the market
    objectively since.</li>
<li>Didn't take profit too early once the price moved back in my favour
    this week.</li>
</ol>
<p>I won't be as lucky every time. Learn from my mistakes and exploit on my
strengths. That is the lesson from this trade.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I made my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">first RRSP trade to short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) using
puts</a> in April. I also made my first careless mistake in my RRSP by
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-just-made-a-grave-fundamental-mistake-in-my-cve-to-trade/">buying more contracts instead of closing the CVE.TO position</a> as I
intended. As of this writing, I am still holding my puts options as the
slow decline seem to be underway. <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6421BP20100503">China's decision to hike reserve
ratio</a> is also helping by strengthening the dollar and putting another
warning on recent risk appetite. Despite putting my real money on the
line, my main focus lately has been the Dukascopy JForex Strategy
Contest. According to their rankings page, I finished at 4th place for
April's contest. Which means I may receive a USD \$1,000 credit to my
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">trading account at Dukascopy</a>. Even if I were to trade a \$5,000
account as I have done in my paper trading, I couldn't have earned 20%
in a single month <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">based on my past performance</a>. This contest is a
great way for me to fill my forex account with no monetary risk.
Frankly, I was just <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-gamble-or-not-to-gamble/">hoping to squeeze in a top 10</a> because I started
late in the April contest. So I am very happy to finish at such a good
position and receive (hopefully) a decent sum of prize money! For anyone
interested, I have discussed about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/">my winning automated strategy</a>
previously. Feel free to take a look at it to see what got me a 4th
place finish. I will be away on vacation in the last two weeks of May. I
don't expect much to happen with my trading this month as I'm inundated
with personal matters. My primary focus is still the JForex Strategy
Contest. I will be using a new semi-automated strategy this time. My
goal is to finish in the top 6 again.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>There is only two more trading days left in the April <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/">Dukascopy</a>
JForex Strategy Contest. I am currently ranked 6th. But there's a fierce
fight for my spot. I've been moving between 6th and 8th all week even
though I haven't made any trade. The other people are putting on big
bets hoping to squeeze in a top 6. Why? According to the winning prize
structure, the 4th to 6th winners will each receive \$1,000. Whereas the
7th to 10th will each receive \$500 only. With my current account
standing at \$120,032 (20% gain) this month, it is quite viable for
others to try to take my spot. See the table below for the top 10
standings as of this writing.</p>
<p><img alt="April standing 2 days before close" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-29-contestranking.png" /></p>
<p>My options are to either fire up my strategy to make more trades or do
nothing. The risk in running my strategy again is that I might lose
money and make myself even less competitive. My strategy's working
timeframe is in hours, so there isn't much room for error. As such, I
feel that with only two days of trading left, time is not on my side.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I will probably lose out my 6th spot as I am not far
away from others behind me. So if I do nothing, I will most likely end
up 7th or 8th and lose half the prize money.</p>
<p>After pondering about this briefly, I've decided to do nothing. The odds
are just too much against me. I have seen too many people in this
month's contest risking to move up from a good rank only to expose
themselves too much and lose out of the top 10 completely.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I found out that the competing strategy in the Dukascopy JForex Strategy
Contest doesn't need to be 100% automatic! According to <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/forex/jforex/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=4771&amp;sid=2ff0fd1b7645652d5f57821451586b08">Contest Support
in the official forum</a>, I can set parameters like take profit target,
stop loss, and long-only or short-only trades. That make this contest
substantially easier to program as I can implement a semi-automatic
strategy, which is what I prefer in my real trading. The problem with
building an automated trading system is that market conditions change
frequently and without notice. Thus, it takes more than a few lines to
program a consistently profitable system to filter out undesirable
conditions. As I discussed before, because all winners in this contest
have to publish their source codes, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reading-the-fine-print-for-dukascopy-jforex-strategy-contest/">I don't want to spend too much time
on this contest</a>. Now that I know I can trade semi-automatically in
this contest. I can just do my analysis manually and then use the
strategy to execute trades when I so desire. That is exactly like <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-is-your-trading-process/">my
real trading process</a> as illustrated before. As you can imagine, I am
very happy of this news. I don't need to scratch my head anymore to
build a new strategy for next month's contest. I programmed and tested
several new ideas in the past 2 weeks but haven't found anything better
than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/">my existing strategy</a>, which has been doing well in April. This
Dukascopy JForex Strategy Contest has been a great incentive for me to
become familiar with JForex. As I intend to use it for my <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">real trading
at Dukascopy</a> (open an account with this affiliate link to receive 35%
rebate on commissions) later this year, this is a win-win situation for
me as I learn the API and possibly win some prize money at the same
time.</p> </div>
