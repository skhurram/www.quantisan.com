            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I placed this order to short AUD/JPY before going to bed last night. The
order was filled overnight. I have tweaked my strategy a little and this
is a first test. I think I need to start naming my strategies and giving
them version number. It will make it easier to keep track in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">my trading
log</a> and for quick comparisons. Here's what I saw to make me throw my
dice at this pair. Figure 1 is the daily and Figure 2 is the 3-hour
chart. My reasoning are as follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>AUD/JPY is testing the top of a channel, Fig. 1</li>
<li>Its RSI is pushing above 80, a level not seen since January when it
    was trading about 67.50.</li>
<li>USD/JPY tested 91 and headed downward.</li>
<li>AUD/USD heading up to the sky with a worsening divergence.</li>
<li>EUR/JPY (a recent <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-eurjpy-135-00-500-1-pips/">+500 pips trade</a>) failed to break 136 and
    showing an evident negative divergence too.</li>
<li>Short term testing of ascending support line, Fig. 2. (Should have
    given this more room though)</li>
</ol>
<p>Position size: 50%, another 50% waiting to enter below 82.90 Entry:
83.60 Stop: 85.50, see Fig. 1. Target: 77.50, bottom of channel, see
Fig. 1. Reward / Risk =610 / 190 = 3.2. The stop is a lot wider than my
previous trades because I'm finding it not worth my time to micro-manage
my trades. However, notice that my total position size is adjusted
accordingly to not risk more than 1% of my forex portfolio in a trade.
My focus is on the daily so it's only natural to give it more room as
I'm not a prophet and couldn't tell when a trade would work out. This is
one of the revision made to this strategy as learned from my recent
lessons. A trade is only as good as what you have learned from it.
Profit is only secondary.</p>

                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-use-png-image-format-for-stock-chart-captures-instead-of-jpg-or-gif/" rel='bookmark'>Why use .PNG image format for stock chart captures instead of .JPG or .GIF?</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If you are like me that keep a detailed trading journal in a blog or in
a computer, then capturing technical analysis charts (assuming you use
TA) is an essential historical record of your trades. I was saving my
charts in JPG format for many years because that's also what my digital
camera used. So I used it without giving much thought. It wasn't until
one day when I realized my saved charts were slightly blurry that I gave
the issue of image format more thought. After some research, I found out
that not all image formats are created equal. Not only do they differ in
compression level, they also differ in their quality and intended use.
This post is intended to summarize my conclusion about why PNG format is
the best for saving stock chart captures. In addition to the popular
JPEG image format, I have often seen other technical analyst bloggers
use GIF to post their charts. As such, I'll compare the 3 formats in
this article. The criteria for judging image format for stock charts are
obviously quality and file size. Quality is definitely what matters the
most because stock charting relies heavily on the points and lines for
comparison and analysis. If you can't figure out the resistance/support,
for example, from looking at the image, then that chart couldn't provide
you with in-depth analysis later. Which would render it useless for the
purpose of reviewing your trades. As for file size, it depends on if
you're posting it online. If that the case, then it's arguably as
important as the quality of the image. Waiting for images to load is an
unnecessary waste of time. Before digging deeper in this topic. I
figured that it's best to just present a real case trading journal
example. Here's what I did for the figures attached below. I captured a
chart of crude oil futures with my trading screen. Moving averages,
channels, volume, and a couple more separate indicators. A pretty
typical setup. The first image is saved in JPG format. It is 213 KB in
size. Click on it to see the full size image. Notice the compression
artifacts. In particular, the distorted colours and pixels. You couldn't
really make out some lines because it's blurred. The second image is in
PNG format. It is only 68 KB in size, a 1/3 of the JPG. You can see that
it's perfectly clear and sharp. If you're interested in more
explanation, continue reading. But be forewarned that this could get
confusing. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics#Comparison_with_other_file_formats">Wikipedia</a>, .PNG images are generally smaller
than GIF but bigger than .JPG. However, PNG images produce sharper
quality than JPG if all else remain equal. Thus, for a clear technical
analysis chart image capture, PNG's file size is smaller than JPG (and
GIF) if the quality and resolution (height and width) are the same. That
is because PNG (and GIF) uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_data_compression">lossless compression</a> technique.
Meaning that the compressed image looks exactly the same as the
original. Whereas JPG uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression">lossy compression</a> technique. Meaning
the compressed image is merely close enough with the original. JPG would
lose out its advantage of smaller file size because it needs to increase
the quality (by reducing compression rate) to keep up with the quality
of PNG. And why the quality setting needs to be high for charts? Because
of the high contrast and non-uniform nature of stock charts. You can
rarely guess what a pixel is like from its neighbours. That is why
lossless image compression is highly preferred. Out of the commonly
supported trading platform export image formats out there, PNG is the
best there is. PNG is also widely supported by web browsers and
operating systems, so it's almost impossible that you will find a
computer that can't read it. In summary, here's a ranking in terms of
file size (for the same resolution and quality of image), #1 being the
best:</p>
<ol>
<li>PNG</li>
<li>GIF</li>
<li>JPG</li>
</ol>
<p>Then a ranking for the quality at the same resolution and file size, #1
being the best:</p>
<ol>
<li>PNG</li>
<li>GIF</li>
<li>JPG</li>
</ol>
<p>(Sorry, I couldn't do a table in this blog) Also note that PNG was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">designed to be an improvement of GIF</a>. So in most cases, PNG beats
GIF. Lastly, there's also BMP bitmap format. Some people may use it
because it's the default for Windows Paint and some other software.
Although, BMP is lossless too, it has no compression at all. For
example, the samples below were 213 KB and 68 KB for JPG and PNG,
respectively, but the BMP file is 3,319 KB for exactly the same image!
Using BMP is a waste of hard drive space for saving stock charts when
you can use PNG for the same image quality. [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After watching the videos below, and from months of observation of this
latest global financial debacle, I am suddenly awashed with a feeling of
hopelessly powerless to this gross unfairness. In which the average,
hard working citizens are pouring money into the pockets of the filthy
and uber rich. If you don't know what I'm talking about here, watch the
video attached below for the tip of the ice berg in this on-going
problem. While Goldman is arguably the best at "legalized stealing" from
the moms and pops, they aren't the only crook on the block. Governments
around the world (not just the U.S.) were handing out money publicly
left and right in the past few months. And many still are. The whole
system is rigged as <a href="http://www.caracommunity.com">Bill Cara</a> has opined countless times in the last
few years. Bill's ingenious move to relocate his operation to the
Bahamas is only starting to shine in these months (to me). In addition
to voting with your ballot (which is useless if the whole system is
rigged), we can vote with our tax money by relocating our financial
operation. However, for those of us that still rely on a day job, this
is not an option. The best I can do right now is to become adequate with
managing our own money instead of depending on the financial salesmen.
This doesn't seem enough for me as the balance of power appears to be
getting worse by the day. Our government grossly tax us on one hand and
hand them out to the rich and well connected in the other. What have
others done/plan to do with regard to this unfair trap us working bees
are stuck in? The first video is Ratigan explaining how Goldman Sachs
made \$3 billions in 3 months (tipped by Stop Investing blog). The
second video is an interview with Michael Moore and Ratigan about where
all these loots are going now.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my successful EUR/JPY long just before the weekend with a tight
stop. Notice from Figure 1 that EUR/JPY is now in overbought territory.
In addition, a negative divergence is developing on the RSI from the
recent 2 peaks also at 135.00. The best thing about this trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-eurjpy-long-100-129-99-stop-128-80/">my
entry</a>. However, I certainly didn't chop this setup the best I could.
Even though I rode this up for +500 pips, I only had a 50% position
size. There were two easily identifiable adding points which I could
have taken advantage of. When EUR/JPY broke above 132.00, which was a
clear short-term resistance, a day after my entry I should have added to
my position then because of short-term momentum. Another chance came at
132.50 or so. As shown in Figure 2, when the price retested the low end
of the channel at 132.50. Both of these opportunities would have
survived with my usual stop of 100 pips. Another disappointment was that
my second half of the position was stopped out shortly because I moved
my stop up too soon. I was confident enough when I placed the order to
enter a full position size. But my over-zealous need to reduce risk got
the better of me. I observed on a daily time frame but traded in the
3-hour. To be more accurate in pointing the finger, it was my lack of
patience that stopped out my other half of the position. Anyway, I did
rode the wave with a sufficient position size. One thing I just noticed
is the T formation in Figure 2. EUR/JPY is back to where it started a
month ago. Where it heads now is uncertain. I will keep an eye on this
pair and aim to re-enter another long in a few days. The trend is your
friend.</p>
