<p>I'm using the intra-day ATR as a risk factor because I'm assuming them
as noise. I use 10 min. as the basis because that's about the time
period I use. The reward is the max daily swing, which is the daily ATR.</p>
<p></p>
As you can see, the reward/risk is about the same for all the liquid
index futures. However, I'm leaning toward YM because of the smaller
contract size and it seems more stable lately. I'll watch the markets
closely from now on.</p> </div>

went to bed. I was too tired and found that I wasn't concentrating. My
brain was definitely off already.</p>
<p>I seriously considered entering a long at about the vertical line. Then
after watching it for a few bars, the price seems to be stuck in a
trading range, so it could go either way. Since I didn't want to wait
for long because I almost fell asleep at the table, I decided to not
enter a position. It was a good decision because the price would have
went below my stop (lowest of past few bars in the trading range) before
rising just a 6 index points, and with a lot of struggle too.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day, there were a lot of choppiness and not a lot of
big swings. It would have been better to stay off the market because my
stops would have been killed.</p>
<p>Although I didn't make any profit for the day, I didn't lose any either.
So I think going to bed early last because I wasn't up for it was a wise
decision.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The 3 trade max. rule is working well tonight. I was more patient to
wait for the right moment. I almost entered my 4th trade but didn't
because I wanted to stick to my rule, at least for the first day.
Luckily, that would have been another losing trade.</p>
<p>I think I'm finally learning that it's not worth it to get into small
moves. The reward/risk ratio is usually not good. And those are usually
the emotional trades too, where I somehow convinced myself the price is
going to move that way. [<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6yCfxzQQ1I/AAAAAAAAANs/jIfly4pLVqg/s400/er2_rpt.jpg" />][]</p>

I entered a short but got stopped out on a quick bump. Then I
immediately got back in once I see the stochastic is doing down and the
price is topping on the fast time period.</p>
<p>This turned out to be a good decision as I rode it down 5 points. I
thought the drop could reach the lower Keltner at first. But from
watching the action, the move seemed to be testing the 50 EMA and
failing to punch through. In addition, I expected there wouldn't be much
volatiliy today because the last 2 sessions had large swings and there
didn't much going on in the fundamental side today (no news). So I
exited while I could. That wasn't the bottom but was close enough
because after a bit of struggle in a tight range, the price did bounce
back up to the day's high. I should have waited a bit more when the
signs were more clear. I think I was just lucky that I exited near the
bottom. It could have easily been a consolidation and then tanked
further.</p>
<p>The proper exit point is when on the fast time period, the price stayed
in a zone for longer than the previous resistance level and the
intermediate time frame showed the hammer formation. Remember, if I
enter on a time frame, use the same time frame for exit. It would have
been a less profitable trade in this case, but the price could have went
further.</p>
