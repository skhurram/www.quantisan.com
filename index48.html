            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm still recuperating from my food poisoning from last week. Meanwhile, I came across this unbelievable <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5481921/the-day-traders-paradise">trading workspace showcase</a> from LifeHacker.</p>
<p><img alt="40 monitors trading workspace" src="/images/img_archive/40montradingdesk.jpg" /></p>
<p>I have no idea how this trader can juggle 40 monitors during his day
trading. I am satisfied with just one 24" monitor on my desk. However,
I'm neither a day trader or a professional trader, so perhaps I'm
missing something?</p>
<p>What do you think of this 40 monitors setup? A dream come true or a
charts nightmare?</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Alright, so I'm <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-first-food-poisoning-experience/">back from the dead</a>. Let's finish this cost-benefit
analysis before the weekend. Here are back links for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-2/">Part
2</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-3/">Part 3</a> in case you missed them. The table below shows my
expected return as derived through part 2 and part 3 of this series. As
you can see, I'm only expected to break-even by risking 1% of my \$5000
TFSA trading account. Trading just for the sake of break-even isn't
exactly an enviable goal. Based on my statistics, I typically say an
expected return of 0.10% per trade is acceptable. Looking at the table,
that would require that I risk 1.5% per trade. [caption id=""
align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TFSA Trading Cost-Benefit for
Reward/Risk = 2.0 and 40% win rate"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/TFSA_trading_cost-benefit_analysis.png" />][][/caption] So I'll have to
risk 1.5% just to scrape in 0.10% of profit? The problem is obvious.
Using a \$5000 trading account with \$5 commission, along with my
historical trading performance simply do not justify the odds. I started
this series to study the cost effectiveness of a Questrade TFSA trading
account. But the conclusion which I derived is much broader. Considering
that even without being taxed, a \$5000 TFSA trading account is
insufficient for trading with a commission of \$5 or higher. Thus, if
this is a taxed, non-registered trading account, the cost would be even
more. As such, not only is \$5000 an insufficient capital for a
Questrade TFSA trading account; \$5000 is simply too little money to
trade any trading account with \$5 of commission per trade for me.
Remember though, this cost-benefit analysis is based on my own
statistics. You can input your own parameters into <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AnZW_RfDqK11dG5jVzUwbDIxWEQ5aFV3cjVRdU5BbFE&amp;hl=en">this spreadsheet</a>
to get <strong>your own set of results</strong>. To be fair, I must clarify that the
problem isn't with Questrade. Even with their <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">lowest trading commission
in Canada</a> (affiliate link), a \$5 trading commission for an account
of \$5000 is simply too much for me. Yes, there's nothing to stop you
from trading with a \$5 commission for a \$5000 account. Heck, many have
claimed to be successful with less than \$5000. However, that's just not
my style. I don't gamble with my hard earned money. I only trade when
the odds are in my favour. If the cost is un-proportionately high, it's
as if I've suffered a setback even before I begin fighting the battle.
As such, I'm going to say "no thanks!" to a Questrade TFSA trading
account for now. My short term plan is to look for a guaranteed TFSA
savings account until I can develop a trading system for Canadian stocks
that would justify the cost-benefit.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My stomach felt awkward after dinner last night. Then around 2am, I felt
like I wanted to vomit. Minutes afterward, my previous meal came gushing
out. That was the most awful experience I've ever felt. Even worse than
the time when I crashed into a ditch while going down a steep hill on my
mountain bike... My throat felt burning from the stomach acid. So being
as bright as I am, I drank some milk and some honey water. Not a good
idea. First of all, I <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/food_poisoning/article_em.htm">shouldn't have any dairy or citrus product for
the first day</a> according to eMedicineHealth. Secondly, my stomach
needed rest before I poured more stuff down. So not too long afterward,
I vomitted a second time. By then, it was pretty evident that I have
food poisoning. I could barely standup and felt dizzy. I took a sip of
water to sooth my throat, researched what I should do online, and just
went back to sleep. Geeky, I know. It was faster to just Google it than
find the number and consult the 24-hour telehealth line we have here in
Canada. But I promised myself that if I vomit a third time, I would go
to the hospital. Fortunately, I didn't have to resort to that. The
instructions online actually worked. I took a nap and allowed my stomach
to rest. Then I gradually drank more and more water and mixed in some
soft food to regain my strength. Took me 2 long hours to eat a banana
and a bowl of oatmeal plus water. After a few more hours of sleep, I
feel much better now. I called in sick at work for today and tomorrow
just in case. I'm just going to chill for a day or two. I see that the
forex market is making some impressive moves overnight. I couldn't care
less at this moment.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This post continue on the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-2/">calculations from part 2</a> of this TFSA
trading cost analysis series. Part 1 is an <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">introduction outlining the
rationale</a> for this work. Let's pick up where we left off. I was just
about to figure out what is my <em>expected profit</em> using probability
theory. To do that, I use my historical performance data to calculate my
probability of profitable trades. I've been calculating my trading
statistics in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/monthly-review/">monthly reviews</a>, so it's just a matter of
aggregating all the monthly data to a single number. After a few
keystrokes, I find that my win/loss percentages are roughly 40%/60%.
Given my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-2/">known reward/risk ratio</a> (discussed in part 2) and
probability of win (40% as noted above), we can calculate a net return
expectancy. This is a simple formula if you know statistics and
confusing if you don't. So I'll just write it out as is but do refer to
the Wikipedia on<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">statistical expectancy</a> if you'd like to know more
about how I derived this. Expected net return per trade = (Average
Reward from Step 1 - Commission) * (Probability of Win from Step 2) -
[(Risked Amount + Commission) * (1 - Probability of Win)] This formula
is the result we seek. We apply the forumula to extend the cost-benefit
table presented last time. Here's a complete cost-benefit table using
the parameters of a \$5000 principal balance, \$5 commission, capital
gain tax of 17.5% (half of marginal tax rate), reward/win ratio of 2.0,
and a 40% winning rate. It likely that you'll have different parameters
than me. So I am <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AnZW_RfDqK11dG5jVzUwbDIxWEQ5aFV3cjVRdU5BbFE&amp;hl=en">sharing my spreadsheet here</a> so that you can use
your own parameters for your own set of results. Download it in your
preferred format and then edit the values under the Parameters column.
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/contact/">Contact me</a> if you have any problem using it. I will discuss the
result and make [my conclusion in the next and final post in this TFSA
trading cost-benefit analysis series][]. Hint: Short answer to the
title's question is NO. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"
caption="TFSA Trading Cost-Benefit for Reward/Risk = 2.0 and 40% win
rate"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/TFSA_trading_cost-benefit_analysis.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<h2>Calculation Example</h2>
<p>For anyone interested, let's calculate one data point of the table above
using all the the steps discussed so far in this series. Using \$10 risk
(0.2% of \$5000) as an example. Known data: risk = \$10, commission
(comm) = \$5, reward/risk = 2.0, probability of win = 40% Round-trip
commission = \$5 x 2 = \$10 Average Reward = risk * (reward/risk) =
\$20 x (2.0) = \$20 Expected net profit = (Average Reward from Step 1 -
Commission) * (Probability of Win from Step 2) - [(Risked Amount +
Commission) * (1 - Probability of Win)] = (\$20 - \$10) * (40%) -
[(\$10 + \$10) * (1 - 40%)] = 10 * 0.4 - [\$20 * 0.6] = -\$8 If I
risk only \$10 on a trade, it is expected that I would <strong>lose</strong> \$8 on
average based on my historical trading performance statistics.</p>
