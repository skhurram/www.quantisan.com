<p>After a couple of weeks of wild ups and downs, we've been stuck in a
trading range this week on low volume (relatively low based on recent
weeks, but about average on regular terms). But seeing today's
end-of-day weakness (testing low on huge volume), I expect the market to
break down tomorrow morning. However, what's more important is where the
bulk of the price will go, so watch the volume tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is like the calm before, yet another, storm. Not really much for me
to do now but just wait and see. If we can hold the 940 support level
(high of 10/10) on the S&amp;P this week, or scrape it on low volume, then
that would be a very good sign.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am going to stick my neck out and say we are bottoming these days.
Why? Here goes.</p>
<p>
In Bill Cara's commentary today, he opines about the [rationale for the
current market crash][] (not the one last week, but this week).

> Why the panic bail-outs? The answer lies in the \$55 trillion dollar
> Credit Default Swap market that is unraveling day to day. Banks and
> central banks are totally focused on the breaks to the credit ring
> when up to \$400 billion of Lehman Brothers CDS obligations come due
> in the next week, with nobody at the teller window to pay up. Lehman
> Brothers is, as you know, bankrupt.
> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><p>
What this means is that unspecified banks holding the Lehman CDS
derivatives will get nothing, and then they will be unable to meet
their obligations to other banks. At stake are the Money Market Funds
on deposit in these banks. The entire system could collapse, so banks
do not want to be in the position of lending to one another. The
credit market has failed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bill suggests that we look at the 3 biggest banks in the world (total
over 90% of CDS market) for the first signs of when the market will tank
further. Because, well... if they can't pull through this mess, we are
really doomed.</p>
<p></p>
So here's where my own analysis comes in. Besides Bill's rationale, we
know the current crisis is caused by the collapse of the financial
market. So I've been looking at the financial heavyweights in any case.</p>
<p>Enough talk, let's look at the market today. After the failed attempt of
a rally earlier this week, the market is widely expected to continue
spiral down. It has. And the media is certainly not short of fueling the
panic. See: Worries over economy spread; global markets sink and
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122411376471138395.html?mod=todays_us_nonsub_page_one">Economic Fears Reignite Market Slump</a>. However, <em>what everyone knows
isn't worth knowing</em>.</p>
<p>The only information traders should listen to though, is the price data.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_394" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>As I was saying, based on yesterday's end-of-day move, the market is
expected to tank today, at least this morning. If we focus on the 3
banks, we can see they have broken yesterday's end-of-day low and are
testing the Monday lows. However, this is the key, their 15 min volume
on today's low is below yesterday's last 15 min when the prices dived.
All of their prices are testing their lows on lower volumes!</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>I believe the selling is drying up</strong>.</p>
<p>Does this mean we'll be shooting up from here? Perhaps. But this is a
very good sign. I would wait until the next significant daily move
(either up or down) and watch the quality of the action before making
any monetary committment in this crazy market.</p>

<p>I'd like to document a useful technique I picked up today from Tom
Sosnoff on <a href="http://shadowtrader.net/">ShadowTrader</a>. It's based on the idea that option pricing
has become so efficient that it can be used to predict actual stock
move.</p>
<p>Since it is expiration Friday this week, the Oct 08 index option are
expiring in two days. So for something like, SPX, the Oct 08 call/put
has only two days left. Thus, there's little time decay factored in the
price for these options with respect to the actual price. In other
words, SPX and SPX options prices are converging.</p>
<p>So if we take the price of the straddle and strangle strike on the
money, it should be the expected move for SPX for this Friday. For
example, SPX closed at 907.84 today. The price for a straddle at 905
strike is \$48.65. The price for a strangle at 900/910 strikes is
\$45.30. We'll average the two numbers (\$48.65 + \$45.30) / 2 = \$47.0.</p>
<p>So the SPX is expected to move about 50 points this Friday either up or
down.</p>

<p>The only thing for certain at this point in the market is that there're
a lot of uncertainties. Notice the several big swing days near the
October low but with open and close near each other (a.k.a. the doji's).
Are we at the bottom yet? I don't know. Have we started a rally attempt
this week? Definitely! Is it going to hold? My intuition says likely.</p>
<p>Why do I say that? Three reasons. Fundamentally, the joint effort by
world central banks to inject billions of dollars into the capital
market isn't going to be unnoticed. Secondly, the up days this week has
been marked by some strong late-day climb across the market. This
suggest the pros/smart money are buying. Thirdly, also notice the
significant volume at the doji last Friday, when the market reached a
new low. Subsequently, the decline in the last two days has been on much
lower, and declining volume.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the fear and panic are still very much alive.
Profit-taking will create some serious resistance going up. Also, the
market has been very irrational lately, so any fundamental or technical
analysis could very well be thrown out the window.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, I believe an intermediate term bull phrase is taking
shape, yet be very cautious in your approach and use a conservative risk
management approach. I am not going to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-errors-lessons-being-long-just-before-the-october-2008-crash/">repeat my errors from last
month</a> when I entered full long just before the biggest market crash

<p>It's time to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/eslr-testing-long-term-low/">review my positions as promised last week</a>. After the
record up day on Monday and then the lackluster follow-through Tuesday,
today is probably going to be a down day in the markets. Given <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/mid-week-market-review-october-15-2008/">my
intermediate term outlook</a>, I am inclined to hold my positions.
However, I need to unload my weakest link to reduce my risk.</p>
<p>Above is a quick snapshot of my current holdings.</p>
<p>Notice that DELL and ESLR are holding on nicely on this down (DJX
-3.18%, SPX -3.57% as of this writing) day after the previous spike.
This is a very good sign indeed as it shows they're likly to hold on to
the previous \~20% gain, at least for now.</p>
<p>Actually, the price action of ESLR seem very healthy in particular.
There's been a couple of big volume spikes in late day trading. Although
it does seem to be in a constant downtrend, as you can see from its
chart.</p>
<p>As for CAF and SLW they are both below support at the moment. CAF has
broken its \$25 support last Friday and is trading below it at the
moment. SLW is definitely the weakest at the moment. If it isn't such a
cash cow, I would probably be selling it in yesterday's rally.
Furthermore, it still seems to be holding on to its decending support
line on the daily chart today.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_377" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>At this point, the question I ask myself is, if I'm in all cash now,
would I be buying these companies at this point? CAF - yes, DELL - yes,
ESLR - yes, SLW - yes. Is this the bottom? I don't know. I'll just have
to wait and see. However, I will watch the day-to-day action of my
holdings carefully and unload one of two of them to reduce my risk.</p>

[![S&P 500 review][]][]
:   S&P 500 review

</div>

<p></p>
I have been waiting to go long in this bear market for a few weeks now,
hoping for a bottom soon (first of my errors).  Then on week of
September 29th, I decided to go all in (error #2).  S&amp;P closed at 1099
that Friday.  A week later, on October 10th, the Friday close of S&amp;P 500
was 899 points, and I am still left holding on (error #3).</p>
<p>Error #4 though, requires some explaination.  Simply put, I was not
reading the chart as I should have.  While both the price action and
contrarian sentiments were bullish, I totally missed out on a basic
technical analysis indicator ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â? the volume.  Looking at
the above chart, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to see that the first
downward break of the trendline in mid-September was confirmed with
volume.  The volume on that day (left blue arrow), and for that entire
week, is substantially higher than usual.  The subsequent mini rally
attempt before the next break has been marked with little volume.  This
suggests that market participants, particularly the longs, still
havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t flocked in yet.</p>
<p>Seeing that, I [should at least reduce my position size by exiting some
of my most weak positions][] (i.e. least profitable positions) before
the weekend.</p>
<p>While this is not my costliest lesson in trading, it illustrates some
very fundamental lessons which I should <strong>reiterate</strong>, because I should
have known better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Never try to pick the top or bottom.  Which I thought I learned from
    my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures trading</a> already.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/">Manage risk according to volatility</a>.</li>
<li>Exit at any cost if it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look right in a bear
    market.</li>
<li>DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get fixated on the individual stocks, look at
    the bigger picture.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
Actually, I think this all boils down to proper <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>.</p>
