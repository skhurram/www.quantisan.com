            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I paid a price last week in trading EURCHF for not knowing the
fundamental analysis about the currency pair. First of all, here's how
my trade played out. The support between 1.500 and 1.510 is apparent if
you look at Figure 1. So I went long as shown in Figure 2 (second blue
triangle from right) based on a positive divergence at a strong support
of 1.510. EURCHF stayed range bound for a over a day while my other
positions were having roller coaster rides. That's when I decided to
tighten up my stop on my EURCHF long from 1.508 to 1.5095 to limit my
risk exposure. As you can see in Figure 2, that was a bad decision. On
October 30, EURCHF made a swing downward to take out the nearby stops
and then launched upward right past my target. That would have been a
quick and low risk play if I hadn't micro-manged the trade and moved my
stop up while the daily setup was still sound. While getting stopped out
is part of the game, as there is never absolute certainty in a trade.
But in this case, the probability of this up move was substantially
greater than I would have guessed. The extra bit of information lies
outside of the chart. It seems that there is a well known secret that
the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been intervening in the market to keep
the Swiss Franc from being even more overvalued. In particular, it's
well known that the SNB has their eyes on the 1.50 and 1.51 levels in
the EURCHF pair. SNB publicly announced their intention to intervene on
March 12. Immediately following the news, the EURCHF pair exploded up
470 pips in 20 minutes that day. If you look at Figure 1, you can see
that gigantic bar on March 12. The DailyFX has an article on this
<a href="http://www.dailyfx.com/story/bio1/Swiss_Franc_Plunges_After_SNB_1236870114798.html">monumental event</a>. Since then, the SNB has been coming to the rescue
of EURCHF in very obvious ways as shown in Figure 1 with the regular
spikes in prices. Prior to this October 30 move, EURCHF had an identical
price action exactly a month before on September 29, as shown in Figure
3. Back then, EURCHF also had a positive divergence on a test of support
at 1.5080. Then next thing you know, the pair popped over a 100 pips.
Obviously, the SNB is trying hard to paint the tape on the monthly chart
of EURCHF. As I was saying, the SNB is intervening in the market to keep
their currency from further over-valuation, which is hurting their local
economy. In both cases of Sept 29 and Oct 30, if the support was broken,
EURCHF would have stepped into a grave on the chart. Just look at that
huge vacuum below 1.50 on Figure 1. In this recent case on Oct 30, even
though I did go long because of the chart, I didn't have the edge of
knowing this information. Which led me missing this easy ride because I
didn't have as much conviction in this trade as I should have.
Coincidentally, as I have been aggravating to improve the win rates of
my trades, this came hitting me right on the head. So while I'm no
economist, I should at least be aware of the fundamental forces at play
in the currencies that I trade. At the end of the day, technical
analysis may provide guidelines to the mass psychology behind price
actions, but it is the fundamental and economic forces that are
ultimately driving the market. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After many trials and errors with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex market</a>
for a month, the first of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setups</a> is finally taking shape.
So I would like to document this approach here after a well executed
trade this week (illustrated below). This trading setup is based solely
on technical analysis. Here's an overview of the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a long term time frame for identifying setup.</li>
<li>Draw the major supports and resistances.</li>
<li>Add a momentum technical indicator.</li>
<li>Add a trend indicator.</li>
<li>An entry is signaled by an agreement of the trend and the indicator
    at the support or resistance price level. Do not enter yet.</li>
<li>Define a short term time frame for timing, use this for the
    following steps.</li>
<li>Draw the supports and resistances on this short time frame.</li>
<li>Place an order when the price breaks the short-term trend to be
    aligned with the trend on the longer one.</li>
<li>Exit when the entry conditions are gone (not necessarily reversed).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is very vague. So here's a real example in practice. Figure 1 shows
steps 1 to 5 on the daily chart of CAD/JPY for a short entry. The entry
point is the bar before the marked vertical line on Oct 21. See that
CAD/JPY tested the descending resistance line (step #2) with a negative
RSI divergence (#3). The trend as suggested by the moving averages is a
choppy downtrend (#4). Thus, the conditions were met and a short entry
is signaled. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"
caption="CAD/JPY"][<img alt="CAD/JPY" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy.png" />]<a href="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy.png">CAD/JPY</a>[/caption] For timing the
entry, Figure 2 is a 3-hour chart of CAD/JPY with the entries and exits
marked. Yellow triangles are entries and red dots are exits. I entered a
full position after CAD/JPY made the initial dive and then retraced to
the previous support (now resistance) line. It bounced right off that
line strongly (left side of figure). I entered at market price once we
made a hammer candlestick (negative signal) the bar before. Stop was
placed at 88.0, near the recent high and at a round number resistance.
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="CAD/JPY,
3-hour"][<img alt="CAD/JPY, 3-hour" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy_3h.png" />]<a href="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy_3h.png">CAD/JPY, 3-hour</a>[/caption] For the exit,
I had a manually adjusted hard stop to be a couple of resistances away.
I kept it loose on purpose because this position was my biggest winner.
(Let your profits run). But once the RSI on the daily passed below 50, I
took a more conservative approach on the exit stop. Then once CAD/JPY
tested 84.50 and hung around 85.0, I tightened my stop and was taken out
at 85.30. Note that my original target was 84.0, so I thought testing
84.50 was close enough. Also note that this setup is expected to be
executed recursively. It is meant to be run so that you're <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">stacking up
your winning position</a> if the conditions and the trend is in your
favour. This is actually where the power with this setup kicks in. I'll
continue with the CAD/JPY example to illustrate this point. Notice in
Figure 2 that I added to this CAD/JPY short at the (second from the
right) yellow triangle point on the chart at 86.3 for 50% more units.
The down move was still intact as shown in Figure 1 at the time. Using
the same setup, I added more units to this position. And by adding 50%
more to my position, I was able to ride that last wave down for +200
pips on these extra units. Otherwise, I would have exited at 85.30 on
the consolidation around 85.0 and left with nothing on the market for
the last big wave. The timing as shown in Figure 2 for this addition
isn't the same as for the original entry. But it's obvious enough on the
figure with the same markings which I used. Simply refer to Figure 2 for
a visual explanation on the timing for this entry. In case you haven't
noticed on Figure 2, but I just re-entered this position with half the
size using the same setup. Since this third entry is still in progress,
I can't comment on it just yet. We'll see how it goes. Finally, for ease
of referencing this trading setup later on, I will call this particular
setup, FTC (forex trend-continuation). Right now it's version 0.1, a
first publication release but still in beta testing with my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper
trading</a>. Once the setup has proven itself, I will use it in live
trading with real money. Then I will christen it with a version 1.0, and
perhaps a better name. In the mean time, I expect more refinement to
this setup as I continue to try it out on paper trading. Check my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC
tag</a> for more sample applications of this trading signal. Update Nov
18, 2009: I've changed the name from FTCS to FTC as I now have a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTR">FTR</a>
setup.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The U.S. dollar finally picked up some strength last Thursday and I
loaded to ride the trend. One of the earliest trade I made in this wave
is going long on USD/CHF. Figure 1 is taken today after a full week
since the initial move in USD. The vertical line marks the day when I
entered this trade on Thursday 22nd late afternoon. Here are my reasons
for making the entry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parity level 1.0000 was a mere 30 pips away from the low the day
    before</li>
<li>Obvious positive divergence on the indicator, Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Breakout on the shorter 3-hour timeframe, Fig. 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>I placed the order just above the resistance and beyond the short term
channel. The order was filled the next day in the morning on the 23rd.
In hindsight, I should have used a half position only and added to it
once it broke the longer term descending resistance as shown in Fig. 2.
That's because a short term break is a low probability move given that
the downtrend was strong. However, USD/CHF was testing parity, which is
as strong a support as you can find for many reasons. As you can see
from Fig. 2, the entry was rather good overall (could have been better
as discussed above). However, I think the exit was also a disciplined
move. My original target was 1.026 as noted below. It was just below
that horizontal resistance at 1.0267 which I marked on Fig. 1. Yet,
there's also the longer term trendline marked on both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.
I had 4-5 positions open at the time and this was one of my strongest
two (the other being CAD/JPY short), so I tried to add to my position
once the pair broke that longer term trendline. However, the line proved
to be strong as USD/CHF retraced and took out my stop as shown in Fig. 2
(red dot, 2nd from right). Nevertheless, the pair remained above 1.0200
and my core position was safe (I moved my stop up). But not all was
well. USD/CHF eventually broke 1.025 but it didn't go far. It printed a
couple more bars on the chart while I kept moving my stop closer and
closer. Also noting that the pair was short-term overbought, I moved my
stop right up to below 1.025 at 1.0245 to lock in most of the profit.
That stop was eventually taken out and the pair took a dive as shown in
Fig. 2. Moving the stop up tight in a short-term overbought condition
was a good choice. I learned this from my recent trades when I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdcad-all-out-1-0872-196-6-pips-and-1-0821-145-6-pips/">left
profits on the table</a>. So I got out against my hope for higher pips
even when the talk of USD making a return to strength was ubiquitous. I
traded what I saw and not what I hoped for, and against the opinions of
other people. If only my entry was a bit more patient, this would have
been one of my best executed trades. Below are the data for my entries.
Position size: 100% First Entry: 1.009 First Stop: 1.0030 First Target:
1.0260 Reward / Risk #1 = 170 / 60 = 2.8 \&lt; 3, but close enough. Second
Position Size: 25% Second entry/stop: 1.0232/1.0220 I didn't have a
target in mind for this addition because it was only to add on the
strength of the existing position.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>We know that prices can go up or down. We also know that the quality of
these ups and downs can be very smooth or very choppy. As such, it's not
surprising that the trend and volatility of a market form the two
universal characteristics of a price action. No matter which market you
trade, the trend and volatility of the prices will influence your
trading and P&amp;L. That can be both good and bad as volatility is a double
edged sword. A fast paced moving market can rain down gold on you or it
can burn your cash away. Most of the time, it's the latter case.
Consequently, there are many ways traders adapt to changing volatility
in the market. You can tailor your trading strategy, change trading
timeframe, switch market entirely, or manage your risk accordingly, for
examples. In this post, I'd like to give an example for the use of a
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">statistically-derived forex position size table</a> to fit with market
volatility. The problem with market volatility is that it's hard to
notice. As opined by <a href="http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/10/jump-in-stock-market-volatility-and-its.html">Dr. Steenberger</a>, "many traders will adapt to
directional changes quicker than they adapt to shifts in volatility."
The art of identifying market conditions is not discussed in this post.
But obviously, if there is a way to build in an inherent way to manage
your risks based on market volatility, you will have built yourself a
safety net. That is the logic behind my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">statistically-derived forex
position sizer</a>. It's a
data-driven tool to impose an inherent safety net in your trading. What
it does is simple. Here's what it boils down to:</p>
<ol>
<li>It finds the recent 2 sigma value (i.e., a statistical measure of
    volatility, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">see wiki</a>) of each major currency pairs.</li>
<li>It calculates the maximum position size for each pair using the 2
    sigma value.</li>
<li>Then it converts the number to correspond with your account currency
    based on a real-time currency exchange rate for each trading pair.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, a table such as <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">this one I published for
forex</a> can give you a
real-time guideline to the maximum position size you should take given
your risk appetite. One shortcoming with this approach is that while you
may limit your loss during a volatile market, you are also limiting your
potential gain. But this is where the old saying, "let your profit run
and cut your losses short" applies. One solution is to simply add to
your winning trades, according to your trading setups, of course. That
way, when the market moves in your favour or you get confirmation on
your setup, you can increase the position size responsibly without
stretching your principal. By now, it's probably obvious that the use of
such a tool is not, and should not, meant to be a solution to changing
market volatility. It is merely a convenience tool to serve as one of
the many that a trader has at his/her disposal. Nevertheless, I find the
table to be very convenient for me because I don't have to worry about
calculating the position sizes manually on each trade. Trading is tough
enough already, so I like to develop <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/">tools</a> that can make my life
ever so slightly easier.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This was definitely one of my better executed trades recently. Here's my
logic for the entry and exit. As shown in Fig. 1, at the time of entry
(marked by the faint vertical line on 10/23), NZD/USD made a negative
divergence with a higher price and lower RSI. There has been a series of
false alarm on the RSI overbought entry signals. However, 0.76 is an
important resistance because it is where the massive downturn started in
July 2008. I timed my short entry based on Figure 2. We made a lower
high just below 0.76 and within the previous channel. Then I waited for
the current downtrend to break the ascending support line to place the
order. The order was subsequently filled on Sunday night during the
Asian open when I was sleeping. Frankly, I wasn't too happy at first
because my fill price was right at the low. I kept my position anyway
and allowed the stop to work for me. This is probably the best decision
I've made with this trade. By remaining patient, I didn't succuum to
micro-managing my position like I've done before. With regard to the
exit, I took profit at my target at the ascending support shown in
Figure 1. That support line worked well for half of the year in this
rapid ascend of NZD/USD. So I didn't want to risk a bounce by taking
profit at this point. However, NZD/USD has traded down to 0.7260 as I'm
writing this. Time will tell if the exit is a good one or that I should
have left half the position in. The net gain for this trade is \$79.82
because I mistakenly entered a full position instead of half as I
should. Here are the R/R that I saw when I entered this trade. Position
size: 100% Entry: 0.7520 Stop: 0.7600 Target: 0.7300 Reward / Risk = 220
/ 80 = 2.75 \&lt; 3. I thought I was entering with only a 50% position size
because of the R/R not meeting my criteria. However, I read my own
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">forex position sizer</a> wrong and gone in with a full position.
Luckily, things have worked out. But I have since updated my position
sizer so this won't happen again.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I started to doubt this move mere minutes after placing it, which rarely
happens. And not because of the price action. It was solely for my
reasoning for this trade. On a quick mental review of this entry, I
noticed that they sounded more like excuses than reasons. First sign of
it was that I laid in a 100% position to fade a strong trend on the
daily on the basis of my 3-hour chart. My strategy is to not risk more
than 50% (preferably 25% - 33%) to fade a trend on the daily. Lack of
discipline #1. Next, I already had six 50% positions open at the time.
That would roughly translate to 3% of my account, without even taking
into account the high correlations (working on a spreadsheet for this).
By adding this 7th position, I've broken my fundamental rule of risk
management to not risk more than 3% of the totals funds at any single
moment. Lastly, it was the end of the trading day on Friday. Carrying
trades over the weekend is well known be even more risky than usual
because so much could happen over the two days. To add a low probability
trade on a loaded to the neck account into the weekend is practically
suicidal. I'm just glad that I had a hard stop to limit my risk. At
least I did something right here. In terms of the dollar amount lost,
the loss for this trade is \$44.17 on paper. And after this stupid move,
I have given up all my +500 pips gain (also on paper) from the week
before. Much work remains to be done to improve my trading performance.
A last note to self from this what-not-to-do lesson. All trades should
be taken with logic and reasons. I failed to do that in this trade by
convincing myself that USD should reverse over the weekend. On top of
it, I took as big of a position as my system allows to gamble on this
intuition. These are two breaches of trading rules that could ruin an
account. It's good that I'm stopped out with a loss in this trade
because if this became profitable, it could boost my ego and this
problem would only get worse. Another silver lining in this is that I am
beginning to trade forex with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> instead of diving in
with real money first. In addition to testing my forex strategies (which
I haven't followed as diligently as I should), I'm learning much about
my weaknesses in trading in general by keeping a detailed journal and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">statistics of my trades</a>. Update: EUR/USD cratered to 1.4844 today.
Another shortcoming with an undisciplined trade is the opportunity cost.
If I weren't so preoccupied with the stop loss from this morning, I
would have followed my setup and shorted EUR/USD today as it went
spiraling down.</p>
