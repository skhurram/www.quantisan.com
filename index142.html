            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Another day, another strategy. For the past couple of days, I've been
working on the 2MA cross with ADX confirmation strategy for ER2H08 1200
sh/bar. Basically, an HMA(Low, 8) crossing over EMA(Low, 24) as the
trigger. Condition2 is that the current high is highest of past 3 bars.
Condition3 is current ADX is also highest of the past 3 bars. Condition4
is that it is during day time so fewer slippage.</p>
<p>Exit is simply HMA(Low, 23) crossing under EMA(Low, 33) or it is nearing
the close of the day session. Stop is \$350; Floor is \$500 and 63%
retracement.</p>
<p>Upon loose optimization on Oct 1, 2007 to Nov 30, 2007 data, the Long
strategy achieved 3.37 profit factor, 57% profitable, and a steadily
rising performance graph. Very good indeed. I was estatic yesterday.</p>
<p>I continued to work on the strategy for the whole day today and
developed a Short version using the same concept. The result were very
good too (PF > 3, etc).</p>
<p>From the back-testing data, the Long and Short together has PF over 2
and steady rising performance too. From the calculation, I would make
over \$7000 for the 2 months on 1 contract alone.</p>
<p>Feeling pretty confident, I felt the system was somewhat complete, so I
tested it using the lastest 30 days of data. Unfortunately, it failed
miserably. PF was way under 1.0 and the gross profit were a mere couple
of thousand dollars. The net profit were estimated to be just a few
hundred dollars.</p>
<p>So I tested the system on another set of data. August 2007. The result
was even worse!</p>
<p>Long story short, I found out that ADX isn't that reliable to confirm
with major swings.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Upon further reading of the charts, ER2 does seem like a better deal for
day trading with a breakout strategy. The intraday swings are typically
more than 10 points (sometimes 30 or more) and ATR is about 1.5 points
only. Furthermore, there seem to be fewer fake breakouts in ER2. See
figure for example.</p>

test some strategies. I'll work on this more this week.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Seeing that many indicators use a MA for calculation. It may be possible
to use new MA algorithm to improve on their calculation.</p>
<p>For example, the RS in RSI is something like RS = EMA(up days) /
EMA(down days). We could change it to RS = HMA(up days) / HMA(down
days). Since HMA is much faster, the resulting H-RSI may be faster too.
This can be useful in day trading strategies.</p>
<p>More work needs to be done to test this idea.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I downloaded Hull Moving Average, Adaptive Moving Average, and a Kalmann
Filter today.</p>
<p>In the figure, the blue/red is HMA(8), cyan is AMA(10), yellow is EMA(9)
as comparison.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4EXOvY4uYI/AAAAAAAAAE0/APxlgKxuETU/s400/3mas.jpg" />][] Notice that HMA is super fast and follows the price closely.
AMA lags more but does a good job of smoothing outt the noise. EMA is as
usual and very laggy.</p>
<p>A strategy I'm thinking of is to use 3 different MA's instead of only
EMA to improve the previously discussed 3EMA crossover strategy. The
problem with the 3 EMA crossover strategy is that EMA lags too much, so
it's not good for day trading so reaction time is the key to catching /
exiting the waves.</p>
<p>Maybe using the HMA as the fast MA, AMA as the base, and something else
to verify the trend can work. As I've said before, remember to use
something to filter out the whipsaws. But don't use something laggy as
it would defeat the whole purpose of a fast indicator.</p>
<p>Also, HMA can be used as a proxy to smooth out some inputs. i.e.
RSI(HMA(close, 8), 14) or HMA(RSI(close, 14), 8).</p>
