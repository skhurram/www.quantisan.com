My strategy for Dow should work on the ER2 too. Moreover, ER2 seems to
be more straightforward and easier to trade. It really does seem like a
nice market to trade. I'll continue to keep an eye on it.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5fFeBzQQTI/AAAAAAAAAJE/cPw6Txz0lV4/s400/ymday.jpg" />][] Dow opened about 200 points lower today, the news were saying
it'd be another down day. But most traders know better. We might be at a
short term bottom at the moment because of the Fed intervention. By
about noon, the market bottomed out to a new low and started to pick up.
The rally went into full gear at almost exactly 3pm (ET) on a rally with
little breathing room for short covering. This was quite expected and
the signals were clear after the noon bottom.</p>
<p>However, this is where I was caught. My first 2 hours of trading were
great. I was up over \$200. Then in the mid-day, even when I was right
about the direction of the market, I ended up down about \$350 because
of all the choppy actions. In addition, I should be more confident of my
belief in a rally because of the obvious uptrend. Yet, the market acted
as if it's going to plunge.</p>
<p>As you can see from the graph above, I got into many trades in the
middle of the day. But not all of them were losing trades. I saw that
the market was in a trading range and profitted from fading the
breakouts. That made me a bit of money, but a few bad trades got me into
the negative.</p>
<p>I wasn't too happy to see my account under \$15,000 in the afternoon.
However, one thing I did well was regain my composure and got back into
the game with a clear mind. I had put my lost behind and only strived to
minimize risk in my later trades.</p>
<p>Fortunately, near the end of the day, a real rally broke out as
expected. I didn't get excited and chased the price. Instead, I waited
my opportunity on a retracement and got into a long. That one last trade
made back all my loses. Even though my short term entry and exit were ok
on this trade. I should have entered another long position on the 2nd
retracement for the 2nd longer leg in the rally to double up on my long
position. I could have made at least another \$1000 or so if I had done
that.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">So three lessons from today</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't waste my time on low reward trade. Only enter trades if I
    expect the reward to be a few times (at least 3) more than my stop.</li>
<li>Be careful in the mid-day when only the pros are swimming. Better
    yet, only trade in first 2 and last 1 hours.</li>
<li>When I am right, raise the stake in the pot! i.e. average up!</li>
</ol>

dollar. Recession is off and inflation is back in town. So gold is on
the run again. (i.e. recession lower demand of gold, inflation raises
value) I immediately took action and closed all my short positions at
\$869.50</p>
<p>Gold price went rocketed today and closed at \$890.60 So now my gold run
is off, even worst, I missed a big opportunity.</p>
<p>When I was certain that gold price would rise, I correctly covered my
short. However, I should have changed side and WENT LONG on it! I still
need to develop this <span style="font-weight:bold;">flip flopping
mentality</span> if I were to improve on my trading. I missed out only
an easy \$20 jump on Gold today because I didn't go long after closing
the short even though I knew for certain the price would increase.</p>
<p>Lesson of the day: <span style="font-weight:bold;">A bad short is a good
long.</span></p>

The market was bound for a small rally. So the Dow moved from a negative
400 something point to almost breakeven and then closed down a 100 pts.
There were many wild swings today. Many opportunities for a day trader.</p>
<p>Although I seem to have done well today, I think I could have done a lot
better.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5avoBzQQOI/AAAAAAAAAIc/8w-84LbudSE/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][]Even though I knew the Dow is going to go up at least 200 pts
from open, I only captured about 150 points of it. I was hesitating a
lot after my winnings because I worried about losing my profits like I
did before. I need to be objective in my rationale.</p>
<p>However, the later day action were a lot choppier and the ATR were a lot
higher. Staying on the sideline may be a good decision. For my later
trades in a volatile setting, I may want to increase my stop because I
have missed a few good trades even though I was ultimately right.</p>
<p>On the other hand, my exits were a lot better today. I wasn't bagholding
nor was I ragholding. I got out when I should rather I was winning or
losing. In addition, my tight trailing stop method saved me a few times.
Although it did got me out too early a few times too.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have adopted this new screen which I developed over the
weekend. It's based on the triple screen strategy by Dr. Alexander
Elder. The big window is for my main time frame. Then two more charts
for a 5x higher and another for a 5x shorter time frames. I only enter a
trade when all 3 (at least the lower 2's) are in sync. Then I exit when
either the short or current time period shows weakness.</p>

The break of the MACD and Stochastic didn't produce a strong pullback as
I have hoped. However, one thing for certain is that by the time even I
am sure it's going to fall, it would have been too late.</p>
<p>I almost entered a short position today. But held back because I am
taking enough risk already with the 4 gold contracts. If I'm to cover 2
fewer Gold shorts, then I may enter a Soybean.</p>
<p>Looking at the past year of history, it seems that Soybean corrections
precede Gold corrections. Coincidence? They seem to be controlled as a
hedge by HB&amp;B. A big drop in prices should come when these people unload
their holdings back into the equities. i.e. near the bottom of this bear
market.</p>

The current price is inching lower instead of falling as it should based
on the MACD and Stochastic bearish signals are disappointing. It's just
going sideways. So I'm wondering would this be just a brief
consolidation before it rises to new highs again? This uncertainty is
definitely why the price is going sideways at the moment.</p>
<p>Price is about \$885 at the moment. It would have been better if I only
had my 2 positions from above \$886. But I entered 2 more shorts at
\$880.10 in fear of missing the train. That was definitely a mistake
because it hugely increased my risk. I pretty much got in at the bottom
of the current trading range. I could have entered easily at \$886 from
the bounce when the indicators were right.</p>
<p>Last night, price of gold dropped to \$870.80 and I had over \$1000 of
paper profit. But it was short lived.</p>
<p>I won't cover on panic at the moment. I might cover the 2 extra shorts
on the next bump. Just so I can makeup for my greedy mistake and lower
my risk exposure in this uncertain situation.</p>
<p>However, after dropping for 3 days in a row, today's higher close is
expected. Next week should be more telling.</p>
