<p>Finally! I have been waiting for a bear market rally for weeks! I
decided to go <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">full long after the bounce from 820 today</a>. Refer to
that post for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">details of my entries</a>. In this post, I would like to discuss why the 820 bounce
gave me the confidence in going all in despite widespread fear and the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/covered-slw-fro-and-wfc-short-puts/">many failed attempts</a> myself.</p>
<p>A quick recap of the past week's action. After the failed rally attempt
from 10/28 to 11/04, the market has been brutal to say the least. Any
strength failed to stir enthusiasm and has bled down slowly. The market
drifted down lower on little volume day after day. If I were to describe
the market, I'd say it looked like the last moment of a dying man. This
lack of will to move has certainly killed many bulls. I was one of them.
I have been stopped out a few times trying to catch this falling knife
(more like a grind). I even prepared to exit the last of my holdings if
we do break down from this point.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the day, the market looked like it's going to be
another down drift today. But being very near the 10/10 bottom already,
I know things are going to move one way or the other before the options
expiry next week. And since the Max Pain for the index options are at
least 10% higher, I am still looking for a reversal soon.</p>
<p>I mentally noted S&amp;P at 845 is an important level. It was the low of the
10/28 big rally day. The market skid on the 845 level all morning with
little volume. That was good because it is testing a support on low
volume. I had thought we may bounce from there.</p>
<p>Then I went to lunch just before noon.</p>
<p>When I got back after 1pm, the market has already broken down. However,
there are several bullish indication I noticed.</p>
<ol>
<li>the break down volume is higher than the previous bar (Figure 1),
    but it's still relatively low. Which means we don't have panic
    selling yet.</li>
<li>both the TICK and Advance-Decline line moving averages (Figure 2)
    are relatively healthy for such an important drop. Indicating no
    broad selling.</li>
<li>notice the unusual V shape for the TICK (Figure 2)? We even reached
    a new multi-day low of -1666. Yet #1 and #2 contradicts this
    seemingly panic selling, so this depression in price looked
    artificial to me</li>
</ol>
<p>Like how the recent rally attempts lacked enthusiasm, this break of 845
and test of 820 looked like it lacked enthusiasm too. Given that this is
such a major support level, odds are that we will bounce from here at
least for intraday. That is when I made my entry.</p>
<p></p>
Before 2pm, we broke 850, the low of yesterday, with the highest 30 min
volume of the week. That is when the rally looked strong to me and my
doubt of a bull trap eased. Frankly, I had some tight mental stops and
prepared to jump if things deteriorate like the many times before.</p>
<p>The day continued strong with price and volume confirmation. We closed
at the high with significant volume. We even reached 700 million volume
on SPY, a first since 10/16. I believe an intermediate bottom has been
set so I'll be looking at a longer timeframe (days) for my long
positions now.</p>
<p>First expected resistance from this move is 980 on the S&amp;P from the
trendline (Figure 1, right). Target is at least the 50 dma, we just
haven't touched it for 2 months. This is as good a time as ever to give
it a run for it.</p>
<p>Today is a great example of the need for critical thinking with a clear
head in light of a lot of pressure and past emotion. The beaten account,
the grim market movement, and the many stopped out trades has nearly
made me walk away for the week. But I remained focus on the market and
made my decision based on the price action.</p>
<p>Despite renewed optimism, I will continue to practice <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">prudent risk
management</a> and to eventually pocket at least most of the profit from
today, if not more.</p>

<p>Another busy day today. I usually write up my entry/exit posts
immediately for my trades, but I needed to keep my eyes on the market
due to the fact that I went all in today.</p>
<p>I'm really tired after a long day and the fact that I went swimming
right after the close. So I'll cut myself some slack and refer you to my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-recollection-of-my-analysis-for-buying-when-sp-broke-down-to-820-today/">market analysis post from today</a> instead. Long story short, I entered
long because of the low volume retest of major support. I held because
the price and volume showed strength in testing the resistance
throughout the day.</p>
<p>I am heavy on ABB because S&amp;P broke down to 820 and ABB is still above
the Oct low of \$10. It has held on triumphantly in this leg of market
selloff. Refer to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-170/">ABB entry yesterday for a more detailed analysis
of the company</a>.</p>
<p>I added to SLW because the commodities are showing some strength too. I
have been a fan of SLW for a while, take a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">look at those posts for my
opinions of SLW</a>.</p>
<p>My plan now will be as usual, I will unload into strength starting with
my weakess position and work my way up.</p>
<p>There're a lot I want to write down, but my mind is blank now. So I'll
leave this as is.</p>

<p>Wrote an In The Money Nov 12.5 put for \$1.70. ABB share price was at
\$10.92 at time of entry. I have been trading in and out too many times
this past two weeks. This trade is intended to let it expire or let the
option being put to me. I have the cash ready to buy 100 ABB shares if
it doesn't expire for an effective price of \$10.80 / share.</p>
<p>Three reasons why I'm fundamentally bullish on ABB.</p>
<ol>
<li>\$8.6 billion in cash and \$2 billion in debt (0.2 debt/equity
    ratio)</li>
<li>It is making use of this cash and current market panic to expand its
    operation. See: Cash-Rich ABB Speeds Up Buys As Markets Weaken. It's
    one of the few companies not afraid to act at this time!</li>
<li>ABB makes power control and distribution systems. It's one of the
    largest builder of power grids. All these talk of alternative
    energy, reduce oil use, hybrid/all-electric cars, etc. have one
    thing in common -- electricity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upside: Good fundamental, active management to make use of current
condition. Significant volume around \$10 last month.</p>
<p></p>
Resistance: Recent top of \$14.</p>
<p>Downside: We seem to be in correction of 10/28 day, moving to low of
about \$10.</p>
<p>Support: \$10</p>
<p>Bottom line: Risk/reward ratio of about 3 to 1. Not that great. But I
can afford to have the shares put to me if this doesn't expire next
week. Not saying I would sit still if it does collapse, but at least I'm
not biting more than I can handle.</p>
<p>On another note, I entered because the market seem to be stronger today.
Notice the Advance Decline line staying around neutral and the TICK not
really down that much.</p>

<p>I covered my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fro-100-nov-08-35-put-390/">short put shorted at \$3.90 this morning</a> for \$4.20
now. Fee \$7.5. A loss of \$45 including commission. The intraday upmove
lacked volume as you can see on the left graph. Furthermore, S&amp;P failed
to break 920 and is struggling at the 900 range.</p>
<p>I think I will wait for FRO to clear the triangle (right graph) before
committing again. It is too close to the neck line at \$30.50 for
comfort, because it could very well break below at this point. Again,
because today's price volume action lacked enthusiasm.</p>
<p>However, I am keeping my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-sap-100-nov-08-375-put-340/">SAP position</a> because that graph shows

Today is another day and another dip in the water. The orderly selling
in the market is acceptable so far. We could either drift lower or
rocket up higher. I have lowered my strike to 35 (used 40 last Friday)
to reduce the risk.</p>
<p>Upside: Unfilled gap above \$41. Reverse head and shoulder forming.</p>
<p>Resistance: 50 dma and head-shoulder neck of \$40.</p>
<p>Downside: Still in downtrend. Broad market may still be in down leg of
trading range to 850.</p>
<p>Support: 10/28 high of \$30</p>
<p>Bottom line: FRO is trading at \$32. Upside/downside ratio is about 4 to
1. Plus I'm short term bullish on the broad market.</p>
