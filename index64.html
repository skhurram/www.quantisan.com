            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I started to doubt this move mere minutes after placing it, which rarely
happens. And not because of the price action. It was solely for my
reasoning for this trade. On a quick mental review of this entry, I
noticed that they sounded more like excuses than reasons. First sign of
it was that I laid in a 100% position to fade a strong trend on the
daily on the basis of my 3-hour chart. My strategy is to not risk more
than 50% (preferably 25% - 33%) to fade a trend on the daily. Lack of
discipline #1. Next, I already had six 50% positions open at the time.
That would roughly translate to 3% of my account, without even taking
into account the high correlations (working on a spreadsheet for this).
By adding this 7th position, I've broken my fundamental rule of risk
management to not risk more than 3% of the totals funds at any single
moment. Lastly, it was the end of the trading day on Friday. Carrying
trades over the weekend is well known be even more risky than usual
because so much could happen over the two days. To add a low probability
trade on a loaded to the neck account into the weekend is practically
suicidal. I'm just glad that I had a hard stop to limit my risk. At
least I did something right here. In terms of the dollar amount lost,
the loss for this trade is \$44.17 on paper. And after this stupid move,
I have given up all my +500 pips gain (also on paper) from the week
before. Much work remains to be done to improve my trading performance.
A last note to self from this what-not-to-do lesson. All trades should
be taken with logic and reasons. I failed to do that in this trade by
convincing myself that USD should reverse over the weekend. On top of
it, I took as big of a position as my system allows to gamble on this
intuition. These are two breaches of trading rules that could ruin an
account. It's good that I'm stopped out with a loss in this trade
because if this became profitable, it could boost my ego and this
problem would only get worse. Another silver lining in this is that I am
beginning to trade forex with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> instead of diving in
with real money first. In addition to testing my forex strategies (which
I haven't followed as diligently as I should), I'm learning much about
my weaknesses in trading in general by keeping a detailed journal and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">statistics of my trades</a>. Update: EUR/USD cratered to 1.4844 today.
Another shortcoming with an undisciplined trade is the opportunity cost.
If I weren't so preoccupied with the stop loss from this morning, I
would have followed my setup and shorted EUR/USD today as it went
spiraling down.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I shorted AUD/JPY on the 20th and then shorted EUR/JPY on the 21st. Both
positions were stopped out before Tokyo opened tonight. I didn't write
an opening post for EUR/JPY because it's the same as usual, long term
setup, short term timing. I'll briefly go over the two trades here and
what I have learned in hindsight. First let's talk about the AUD/JPY
trade. I wrote about the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-50-83-60-stop-85-50/">entry here</a>. Figure 1 shows the daily chart.
AUD/JPY has managed to edge out of its channel with an obvious negative
divergence on the RSI. However, it feels as though it's going to turn
any time soon as seen in Fig. 2. I'm not going to try again though
because I need to learn to trade what I see and what I feel. I shouldn't
even consider to short it until its below the short term channel. For
this AUD/JPY short entry, I entered too early because I drew my channel
too tight. If you compare Fig. 2 in this post with Fig. 2 from the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-50-83-60-stop-85-50/">entry post</a>, you'll see that the supporting line is lower
here. The previous line didn't enclose everything as it should. For my
EUR/JPY trade, I tried to short the top again.... <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">When will I learn</a>?
Fig. 3 shows the setup on the daily. EUR/JPY is obviously testing a
strong resistance. So far so good. Fig. 4 shows the 3-hour chart for my
entry (yellow inverted triangle to the right, the last red dot is the
exit). This is where I failed. EUR/JPY was testing 137 and the top of
the channel before I entered. Then once I saw that EUR/JPY failed to
touch 137 again for a few bars, I entered. Shorting a new top is
ill-advised because the price can consolidate upward along with the
channel as shown in Fig. 4. You'll be fighting a losing battle as the
momentum is working against you. In any case, the lesson from both of
these trades is that I need to learn to be more patient with my entry.
The loss for AUD/JPY is -130 pips for -\$29.82 and the loss for EUR/JPY
is -77 pips for -\$26.46. At least my position size was halved because I
knew these are risky trades. Note: All the charts were taken just now
after the exit. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Below is a spreadsheet of <strong>real-time</strong> (end of day data), statistically
determined maximum recommended position size for accounts in US Dollar,
Euro, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Swiss Franc, British Pound, or
Canadian Dollar. The table is for use with trading major forex pairs and
crosses in the daily timeframe. These target maximum units are based on
an at-risk amount per trade of \$100 in U.S. dollar (and numerically
equivalent in other home currencies) to expect for 2 standard deviations
(95th percentile) of the daily ranges for each of the corresponding
currency trade pair.
<iframe width="580" height="700" frameborder="0" src="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tDkmtohmo9jD1jAX_xRGegg&amp;single=true&amp;gid=19&amp;output=html&amp;widget=true"></iframe>
In case the spreadsheet data doesn't load (which happens often as there
are a lot of calculations behind it), here's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-02-07-ForexPositionSizer.png">a link to an image capture
of the table</a> taken on February 7, 2010. You can convert these
published units to correspond with your own risk appetite by multiplying
the units shown with the number of times of your own portfolio risk
amount with respect to \$100. For example, if your forex account has USD
\$25,000 and you're willing to risk 1% on each trade, that amounts to
\$250 risked per trade, which is 2.5 times of \$100. Say if you want to
trade EUR/JPY, look up EUR/JPY on Table 1 (since you're using USD) to
find that the target position size is 6175 (as of this writing). Simply
times 2.5 of that number, which equal 15,438 units. The target maximum
number of units is calculated as follow for each currency pair.</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the daily range (high - low) for the past 45 days up to
    yesterday. The data and tables are updated at the end of each day.</li>
<li>Calculate the standard deviation for the ranges.</li>
<li>Solve the formula: Units = Risk Amount / [2sigma * Quote(2nd
    currency/base currency)]</li>
</ol>
<p>Scroll the horizontal bar beneath the table to move the view to your
account's base currency. It is best if you copy and paste the data
because the connection to Google Finance is not guaranteed. So the table
might not work at times. The pairs/crosses listed in the table are as
follow: AUD/JPY, AUD/USD, CAD/JPY, EUR/CHF, EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY, EUR/USD,
GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, NZD/USD, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY. If you like this

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well, that descending trendline didn't last long for GBP/USD. I shorted
it when it was testing it and saw that the RSI was at a prior high too
(Fig. 1). I placed my order just below the short-term ascending support
to hope for a break to the downside, see Fig. 2. GBP/USD consolidated
around that short-term support for a few hours and has now broken upward
to a strong resistance at 1.6600. It's the top of a previous congestion
zone, highlighted rectangle in Fig. 1. GBP/USD at 1.666 is a very
tempting short, but never short a new high, as my rules say. So I'm
gonna wait for a few more hours with this and see how it goes. Position
size: 50% Entry: 1.634 Stop: 1.645, stopped out. Target: 1.6100 Reward /
Risk = 240 / 110 = 2.2 \&lt; 3, so only 50% position. I think I'll stick
with the 3 factor as a limit. Even these 2+ trades aren't working so
well for me because my probability of success has been low.</p>
