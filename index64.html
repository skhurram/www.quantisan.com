            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This was definitely one of my better executed trades recently. Here's my
logic for the entry and exit. As shown in Fig. 1, at the time of entry
(marked by the faint vertical line on 10/23), NZD/USD made a negative
divergence with a higher price and lower RSI. There has been a series of
false alarm on the RSI overbought entry signals. However, 0.76 is an
important resistance because it is where the massive downturn started in
July 2008. I timed my short entry based on Figure 2. We made a lower
high just below 0.76 and within the previous channel. Then I waited for
the current downtrend to break the ascending support line to place the
order. The order was subsequently filled on Sunday night during the
Asian open when I was sleeping. Frankly, I wasn't too happy at first
because my fill price was right at the low. I kept my position anyway
and allowed the stop to work for me. This is probably the best decision
I've made with this trade. By remaining patient, I didn't succuum to
micro-managing my position like I've done before. With regard to the
exit, I took profit at my target at the ascending support shown in
Figure 1. That support line worked well for half of the year in this
rapid ascend of NZD/USD. So I didn't want to risk a bounce by taking
profit at this point. However, NZD/USD has traded down to 0.7260 as I'm
writing this. Time will tell if the exit is a good one or that I should
have left half the position in. The net gain for this trade is \$79.82
because I mistakenly entered a full position instead of half as I
should. Here are the R/R that I saw when I entered this trade. Position
size: 100% Entry: 0.7520 Stop: 0.7600 Target: 0.7300 Reward / Risk = 220
/ 80 = 2.75 \&lt; 3. I thought I was entering with only a 50% position size
because of the R/R not meeting my criteria. However, I read my own
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">forex position sizer</a> wrong and gone in with a full position.
Luckily, things have worked out. But I have since updated my position
sizer so this won't happen again.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I started to doubt this move mere minutes after placing it, which rarely
happens. And not because of the price action. It was solely for my
reasoning for this trade. On a quick mental review of this entry, I
noticed that they sounded more like excuses than reasons. First sign of
it was that I laid in a 100% position to fade a strong trend on the
daily on the basis of my 3-hour chart. My strategy is to not risk more
than 50% (preferably 25% - 33%) to fade a trend on the daily. Lack of
discipline #1. Next, I already had six 50% positions open at the time.
That would roughly translate to 3% of my account, without even taking
into account the high correlations (working on a spreadsheet for this).
By adding this 7th position, I've broken my fundamental rule of risk
management to not risk more than 3% of the totals funds at any single
moment. Lastly, it was the end of the trading day on Friday. Carrying
trades over the weekend is well known be even more risky than usual
because so much could happen over the two days. To add a low probability
trade on a loaded to the neck account into the weekend is practically
suicidal. I'm just glad that I had a hard stop to limit my risk. At
least I did something right here. In terms of the dollar amount lost,
the loss for this trade is \$44.17 on paper. And after this stupid move,
I have given up all my +500 pips gain (also on paper) from the week
before. Much work remains to be done to improve my trading performance.
A last note to self from this what-not-to-do lesson. All trades should
be taken with logic and reasons. I failed to do that in this trade by
convincing myself that USD should reverse over the weekend. On top of
it, I took as big of a position as my system allows to gamble on this
intuition. These are two breaches of trading rules that could ruin an
account. It's good that I'm stopped out with a loss in this trade
because if this became profitable, it could boost my ego and this
problem would only get worse. Another silver lining in this is that I am
beginning to trade forex with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> instead of diving in
with real money first. In addition to testing my forex strategies (which
I haven't followed as diligently as I should), I'm learning much about
my weaknesses in trading in general by keeping a detailed journal and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">statistics of my trades</a>. Update: EUR/USD cratered to 1.4844 today.
Another shortcoming with an undisciplined trade is the opportunity cost.
If I weren't so preoccupied with the stop loss from this morning, I
would have followed my setup and shorted EUR/USD today as it went
spiraling down.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I shorted AUD/JPY on the 20th and then shorted EUR/JPY on the 21st. Both
positions were stopped out before Tokyo opened tonight. I didn't write
an opening post for EUR/JPY because it's the same as usual, long term
setup, short term timing. I'll briefly go over the two trades here and
what I have learned in hindsight. First let's talk about the AUD/JPY
trade. I wrote about the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-50-83-60-stop-85-50/">entry here</a>. Figure 1 shows the daily chart.
AUD/JPY has managed to edge out of its channel with an obvious negative
divergence on the RSI. However, it feels as though it's going to turn
any time soon as seen in Fig. 2. I'm not going to try again though
because I need to learn to trade what I see and what I feel. I shouldn't
even consider to short it until its below the short term channel. For
this AUD/JPY short entry, I entered too early because I drew my channel
too tight. If you compare Fig. 2 in this post with Fig. 2 from the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-50-83-60-stop-85-50/">entry post</a>, you'll see that the supporting line is lower
here. The previous line didn't enclose everything as it should. For my
EUR/JPY trade, I tried to short the top again.... <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">When will I learn</a>?
Fig. 3 shows the setup on the daily. EUR/JPY is obviously testing a
strong resistance. So far so good. Fig. 4 shows the 3-hour chart for my
entry (yellow inverted triangle to the right, the last red dot is the
exit). This is where I failed. EUR/JPY was testing 137 and the top of
the channel before I entered. Then once I saw that EUR/JPY failed to
touch 137 again for a few bars, I entered. Shorting a new top is
ill-advised because the price can consolidate upward along with the
channel as shown in Fig. 4. You'll be fighting a losing battle as the
momentum is working against you. In any case, the lesson from both of
these trades is that I need to learn to be more patient with my entry.
The loss for AUD/JPY is -130 pips for -\$29.82 and the loss for EUR/JPY
is -77 pips for -\$26.46. At least my position size was halved because I
knew these are risky trades. Note: All the charts were taken just now
after the exit. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Below is a spreadsheet of <strong>real-time</strong> (end of day data), statistically
determined maximum recommended position size for accounts in US Dollar,
Euro, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Swiss Franc, British Pound, or
Canadian Dollar. The table is for use with trading major forex pairs and
crosses in the daily timeframe. These target maximum units are based on
an at-risk amount per trade of \$100 in U.S. dollar (and numerically
equivalent in other home currencies) to expect for 2 standard deviations
(95th percentile) of the daily ranges for each of the corresponding
currency trade pair.
<iframe width="580" height="700" frameborder="0" src="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tDkmtohmo9jD1jAX_xRGegg&amp;single=true&amp;gid=19&amp;output=html&amp;widget=true"></iframe>
In case the spreadsheet data doesn't load (which happens often as there
are a lot of calculations behind it), here's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-02-07-ForexPositionSizer.png">a link to an image capture
of the table</a> taken on February 7, 2010. You can convert these
published units to correspond with your own risk appetite by multiplying
the units shown with the number of times of your own portfolio risk
amount with respect to \$100. For example, if your forex account has USD
\$25,000 and you're willing to risk 1% on each trade, that amounts to
\$250 risked per trade, which is 2.5 times of \$100. Say if you want to
trade EUR/JPY, look up EUR/JPY on Table 1 (since you're using USD) to
find that the target position size is 6175 (as of this writing). Simply
times 2.5 of that number, which equal 15,438 units. The target maximum
number of units is calculated as follow for each currency pair.</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the daily range (high - low) for the past 45 days up to
    yesterday. The data and tables are updated at the end of each day.</li>
<li>Calculate the standard deviation for the ranges.</li>
<li>Solve the formula: Units = Risk Amount / [2sigma * Quote(2nd
    currency/base currency)]</li>
</ol>
<p>Scroll the horizontal bar beneath the table to move the view to your
account's base currency. It is best if you copy and paste the data
because the connection to Google Finance is not guaranteed. So the table
might not work at times. The pairs/crosses listed in the table are as
follow: AUD/JPY, AUD/USD, CAD/JPY, EUR/CHF, EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY, EUR/USD,
GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, NZD/USD, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY. If you like this
