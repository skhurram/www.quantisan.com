            <div class="article-content"> <p>I ditched my GE calls at the open today when the S&amp;P 500 made a gap up
and GE gapped open at \$11.10. These options were purchased at 0.49. So
that's a loss of \$56.35 + \$15 for commission. However, I'm definitely
out too early as GE is hanging around \$11.50 as I'm writing this.</p>
<p>The reason for this quick exit is because the long weekend starts
tomorrow so the options premium is sure to drop. Since I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-5-ge-100-apr-09-11-put-79/">cleared my
puts for GE on Tuesday</a> already, I'm out of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">my GE strangle</a>
entirely now.</p>
<p>In addition to a bad entry on my part, the time decay really ate up my
premiums. I should review the details of this trade another time. I am
off to a long weekend soon.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I entered a long position in US Oil Fund (USO) today by writing puts.
(CBOE has a good article about put writing strategy, <a href="http://www.cboe.com/micro/put/PUTIndexEnnisKnupp.pdf">PDF here</a>) At
least this time, time decay will be on my side. Seeing that USO traded
down to 28.40's in the pre-market, I placed a limit order at 8am at
2.05, but it was never triggered when I got back to my desk at 10:30. NY
crude oil futures (QM) went just below \$48 but it bounced back pretty
quick. This led to my conviction that Oil has strength underneath its
belt.</p>
<p>As I suggested in the weekly review, I'm to look for values in the
tech/telecom. But I also noted Basic Materials as a viable alternative.
Well, I read through a few charts last night, namely ADBE, INTC, and
CHL, but as nice as they were, they aren't screaming buys at this point
based on the indicators and chart.</p>
<p>I also considered precious metals using SLW, but Gold/Silver seems to be
at a pivot level at this point. So it's anybody's game for them.</p>
<p>Then I read a couple of blog posts regarding USO/UCO from some
respectable traders. Figure 1 and Figure 2 shows my own analysis. The
pattern looks good and the indicators are in buy zone too. On top of
that, the overnight and premarket moves as I explained above looked good
too. That's when I decided to enter.</p>

<p>Target: From Figure 2, \$32 is first level. Then \$34.</p>
<p>Stop: Recent lows about \$28.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Since I wrote puts on this, time is on my side. The time
decay in options will add to my bottom line. And because we long weekend
coming, the options premium is going to drop and bunch as well as low
activity level expected this week. I will try to hold this until next
week and hopefully longer.</p>
<p>On a sidenote, I feel that I've learned from my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-5-ge-100-apr-09-11-put-79/">recent mistakes</a> of
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-31-srs-4808/">entering too early</a> and demonstrated patience and discipline in this
entry. In particular, I <strong>waited til the morning and watched it bounce
on support before placing a limit order</strong>.</p>
<p>USO touched \$29 and retraced to close its intra-day gap when I entered
this position. It just glided over the support and bounced right back.
That was very bullish in the short term. As I'm writing this, USO
continued its climb to \$29.80 now.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm out the short side of my GE strangle. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">purchased these puts at
0.872</a>. I loss about \$41 for this trade alone. Doesn't look too bad,
but remember, I still have my calls to get rid of, and those are the
real losers. I'm down \$172 for the calls at this moment.</p>
<p>The reason for ditching my GE puts now is simply because it is refusing
to go down. In fact, it is outperforming the market for the last few
days even as we're retracing in the market, see Figure 1.<em>If a ship is
refusing to sink in a storm, it is surely a sign of strength.</em> GE has
filled a gap with low volume, Figure 2. It could very well shoot back up
from here.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is a long weekend and there's probably going to be
little action all week. The <strong>time decay is going to really hurt me</strong> as
we approach expiration soon. It has been dropping steadily already. Time
is definitely not on my side for this trade. So I've decided to ditch it
on signs of strength of GE.</p>
<p>At this point, I would like to clear this off of my desk and look for a
re-entry.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I said on Tuesday, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-is-looking-ready-to-continue-its-bear-rally/">the market looked like it's going up</a>, and
going up it went. In last week's review, I also said <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-march-29-2009/">we're in a
congestion zone around 820 - 830</a> for the S&amp;P 500. Well, we finally
broke above 830, yet, the volume was light. We had acceptable volume on
Thursday when we broke through 840 for the first time in this up leg,
but the follow through on Friday was disappointing. We reached
marginally higher on Friday but the volume was almost non-existent.</p>
<p>Looking at Figure 2, we can see that 840 is exactly the point when we
ended our first crash in October 10, 2008. If we are to break that
resistance, we definitely need more momentum than what Friday provided
us. As it stand now, this 840 is a critical pivot point in both the long
and short term. Thus, we could be in for some more range-bound trading
as the market bounces around this level prior to a big move. However,
note that we've been in this range for over a week already ... so this
is a good time to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-gs-100-apr-09-105-put-955/">manage your risks</a> in case the market gaps against
your favour.</p>
<p>Also, Thursday's gap up provided a nice point to draw a new bullish
channel. And what do you know, the supports are pegged at 820 and 800
again ...<strong>This is going to be one big move one way or the other with
everything seemingly coming together in the short and long term</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>GICS Sectors Review</strong></p>
<p>From the 6-month chart, we see that the Financial (XLF) and Industrial
(SLI) are still testing their respective resistances from February. On
the other end of the run, the Technology and Telecom sectors (XLK, IYZ)
has broken above several resistances and is leading the pack. This is
definitely something to keep in mind, i.e. <strong>find values in the
Techs/Telecom to ride upon on the way up</strong>. Basic Materials (XLB) is a
close third.</p>
<p>From the 1-month chart, it's pretty clear that the financial made a
dead-cat's bounce this month and led the pack by a good margin.
Healthcare (XLV), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Utilities (XLU), a.k.a.
the defensive sectors, are at the bottom of the pack. This is no doubt
yet another mark of a bear rally as people are pulling money from these
safe havens into more riskier sectors.</p>
<p>More importantly though, of the top 5 leading sectors in this month's
rally, only the Industrial (XLI) failed to make a new high in this
week's run compared to the week before. This is definitely a big thumb
down for the Industrial. Which coincides with my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">analysis for General
Electric (GE)</a>, in particular, so far. <strong>Correction:</strong> Upon closer
inspection of the individual tickers, both XLF and XLI are making a
short term double top.</p>
<p>The 5-day chart is basically a zoomed in version of the 1-month. Thus,
we're still in a bear rally mode this week. Actually, we see that the
Healthcare (XLV) is lagging even farther to its two other friends (XLP,
XLU) for the week.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Yes, I'm still holding on to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-31-srs-4808/">SRS from yesterday</a>. I'm down
\$10/share at the close today. However, we are just testing a long term
support line here. Furthermore, the market is only up about 1% today
whereas SRS tanked 17.58%. This is definitely capitulation of SRS we're
seeing now. The question I ask myself is, would I be buying at this
level? Given the above two reasons, the answer is yes. Yet, I would
definitely ditch it early next week if there's continued weakness for
SRS.</p>
<p>My biggest mistake for this trade is entering too early. Note to self,
<strong>wait for a bounce from support before entering and set a hard stop
just below it</strong>.</p>
