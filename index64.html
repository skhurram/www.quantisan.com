            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>We know that prices can go up or down. We also know that the quality of
these ups and downs can be very smooth or very choppy. As such, it's not
surprising that the trend and volatility of a market form the two
universal characteristics of a price action. No matter which market you
trade, the trend and volatility of the prices will influence your
trading and P&amp;L. That can be both good and bad as volatility is a double
edged sword. A fast paced moving market can rain down gold on you or it
can burn your cash away. Most of the time, it's the latter case.
Consequently, there are many ways traders adapt to changing volatility
in the market. You can tailor your trading strategy, change trading
timeframe, switch market entirely, or manage your risk accordingly, for
examples. In this post, I'd like to give an example for the use of a
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">statistically-derived forex position size table</a> to fit with market
volatility. The problem with market volatility is that it's hard to
notice. As opined by <a href="http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/10/jump-in-stock-market-volatility-and-its.html">Dr. Steenberger</a>, "many traders will adapt to
directional changes quicker than they adapt to shifts in volatility."
The art of identifying market conditions is not discussed in this post.
But obviously, if there is a way to build in an inherent way to manage
your risks based on market volatility, you will have built yourself a
safety net. That is the logic behind my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">statistically-derived forex
position sizer</a>. It's a
data-driven tool to impose an inherent safety net in your trading. What
it does is simple. Here's what it boils down to:</p>
<ol>
<li>It finds the recent 2 sigma value (i.e., a statistical measure of
    volatility, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">see wiki</a>) of each major currency pairs.</li>
<li>It calculates the maximum position size for each pair using the 2
    sigma value.</li>
<li>Then it converts the number to correspond with your account currency
    based on a real-time currency exchange rate for each trading pair.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, a table such as <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">this one I published for
forex</a> can give you a
real-time guideline to the maximum position size you should take given
your risk appetite. One shortcoming with this approach is that while you
may limit your loss during a volatile market, you are also limiting your
potential gain. But this is where the old saying, "let your profit run
and cut your losses short" applies. One solution is to simply add to
your winning trades, according to your trading setups, of course. That
way, when the market moves in your favour or you get confirmation on
your setup, you can increase the position size responsibly without
stretching your principal. By now, it's probably obvious that the use of
such a tool is not, and should not, meant to be a solution to changing
market volatility. It is merely a convenience tool to serve as one of
the many that a trader has at his/her disposal. Nevertheless, I find the
table to be very convenient for me because I don't have to worry about
calculating the position sizes manually on each trade. Trading is tough
enough already, so I like to develop <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/">tools</a> that can make my life
ever so slightly easier.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This was definitely one of my better executed trades recently. Here's my
logic for the entry and exit. As shown in Fig. 1, at the time of entry
(marked by the faint vertical line on 10/23), NZD/USD made a negative
divergence with a higher price and lower RSI. There has been a series of
false alarm on the RSI overbought entry signals. However, 0.76 is an
important resistance because it is where the massive downturn started in
July 2008. I timed my short entry based on Figure 2. We made a lower
high just below 0.76 and within the previous channel. Then I waited for
the current downtrend to break the ascending support line to place the
order. The order was subsequently filled on Sunday night during the
Asian open when I was sleeping. Frankly, I wasn't too happy at first
because my fill price was right at the low. I kept my position anyway
and allowed the stop to work for me. This is probably the best decision
I've made with this trade. By remaining patient, I didn't succuum to
micro-managing my position like I've done before. With regard to the
exit, I took profit at my target at the ascending support shown in
Figure 1. That support line worked well for half of the year in this
rapid ascend of NZD/USD. So I didn't want to risk a bounce by taking
profit at this point. However, NZD/USD has traded down to 0.7260 as I'm
writing this. Time will tell if the exit is a good one or that I should
have left half the position in. The net gain for this trade is \$79.82
because I mistakenly entered a full position instead of half as I
should. Here are the R/R that I saw when I entered this trade. Position
size: 100% Entry: 0.7520 Stop: 0.7600 Target: 0.7300 Reward / Risk = 220
/ 80 = 2.75 \&lt; 3. I thought I was entering with only a 50% position size
because of the R/R not meeting my criteria. However, I read my own
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">forex position sizer</a> wrong and gone in with a full position.
Luckily, things have worked out. But I have since updated my position
sizer so this won't happen again.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I started to doubt this move mere minutes after placing it, which rarely
happens. And not because of the price action. It was solely for my
reasoning for this trade. On a quick mental review of this entry, I
noticed that they sounded more like excuses than reasons. First sign of
it was that I laid in a 100% position to fade a strong trend on the
daily on the basis of my 3-hour chart. My strategy is to not risk more
than 50% (preferably 25% - 33%) to fade a trend on the daily. Lack of
discipline #1. Next, I already had six 50% positions open at the time.
That would roughly translate to 3% of my account, without even taking
into account the high correlations (working on a spreadsheet for this).
By adding this 7th position, I've broken my fundamental rule of risk
management to not risk more than 3% of the totals funds at any single
moment. Lastly, it was the end of the trading day on Friday. Carrying
trades over the weekend is well known be even more risky than usual
because so much could happen over the two days. To add a low probability
trade on a loaded to the neck account into the weekend is practically
suicidal. I'm just glad that I had a hard stop to limit my risk. At
least I did something right here. In terms of the dollar amount lost,
the loss for this trade is \$44.17 on paper. And after this stupid move,
I have given up all my +500 pips gain (also on paper) from the week
before. Much work remains to be done to improve my trading performance.
A last note to self from this what-not-to-do lesson. All trades should
be taken with logic and reasons. I failed to do that in this trade by
convincing myself that USD should reverse over the weekend. On top of
it, I took as big of a position as my system allows to gamble on this
intuition. These are two breaches of trading rules that could ruin an
account. It's good that I'm stopped out with a loss in this trade
because if this became profitable, it could boost my ego and this
problem would only get worse. Another silver lining in this is that I am
beginning to trade forex with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> instead of diving in
with real money first. In addition to testing my forex strategies (which
I haven't followed as diligently as I should), I'm learning much about
my weaknesses in trading in general by keeping a detailed journal and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">statistics of my trades</a>. Update: EUR/USD cratered to 1.4844 today.
Another shortcoming with an undisciplined trade is the opportunity cost.
If I weren't so preoccupied with the stop loss from this morning, I
would have followed my setup and shorted EUR/USD today as it went
spiraling down.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I shorted AUD/JPY on the 20th and then shorted EUR/JPY on the 21st. Both
positions were stopped out before Tokyo opened tonight. I didn't write
an opening post for EUR/JPY because it's the same as usual, long term
setup, short term timing. I'll briefly go over the two trades here and
what I have learned in hindsight. First let's talk about the AUD/JPY
trade. I wrote about the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-50-83-60-stop-85-50/">entry here</a>. Figure 1 shows the daily chart.
AUD/JPY has managed to edge out of its channel with an obvious negative
divergence on the RSI. However, it feels as though it's going to turn
any time soon as seen in Fig. 2. I'm not going to try again though
because I need to learn to trade what I see and what I feel. I shouldn't
even consider to short it until its below the short term channel. For
this AUD/JPY short entry, I entered too early because I drew my channel
too tight. If you compare Fig. 2 in this post with Fig. 2 from the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-50-83-60-stop-85-50/">entry post</a>, you'll see that the supporting line is lower
here. The previous line didn't enclose everything as it should. For my
EUR/JPY trade, I tried to short the top again.... <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">When will I learn</a>?
Fig. 3 shows the setup on the daily. EUR/JPY is obviously testing a
strong resistance. So far so good. Fig. 4 shows the 3-hour chart for my
entry (yellow inverted triangle to the right, the last red dot is the
exit). This is where I failed. EUR/JPY was testing 137 and the top of
the channel before I entered. Then once I saw that EUR/JPY failed to
touch 137 again for a few bars, I entered. Shorting a new top is
ill-advised because the price can consolidate upward along with the
channel as shown in Fig. 4. You'll be fighting a losing battle as the
momentum is working against you. In any case, the lesson from both of
these trades is that I need to learn to be more patient with my entry.
The loss for AUD/JPY is -130 pips for -\$29.82 and the loss for EUR/JPY
is -77 pips for -\$26.46. At least my position size was halved because I
knew these are risky trades. Note: All the charts were taken just now
after the exit. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"
