            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4-s9PY4uuI/AAAAAAAAAHk/6bblNJTEapQ/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][] Today is less volitile. I'm also using a higher contract count
to filter out the noise. It's also because I found that I'm not quick
trigger enough on fast times. I'm using 1200 contracts/bar at the
moment. It seems to be good. I'm also a lot more disciplined today. Not
over trading and sticking to my strategy. At the very least, my recent
loses have given me valuable experiences in day trading. Also, the floor
pivot points have been very reliable so far. The price seems to like to
bounce around these levels or settle in a range near them. Very useful
in identifying breakouts or exhaustions.</p>
<p>Here are some changes I added to my day trading screen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implemented my CCI and Stochastic strategy into a PaintBar with
    alarms</li>
<li>Added Stochastic crossing of oversold or overbought as ShowMe with
    alarms</li>
<li>Increased contracts/bar to 1200 contracts / bar for slower time
    frame</li>
<li>Added trailing stop Auto Strategy to pull the trigger for me (but
    doesn't seem to be working)</li>
<li>Decreased stop to 10 points on YM.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Never chase the price!</span> It's
    ok to miss some opportunities.</li>
<li>Only buy at the good end of the immediate trading range.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do chase the price with a trailing
    stop!</span></li>
<li>New money management technique: once price started to move in
    favoured direction, move stop to 2 points ahead of entry price to
    cover costs and then trail it with the price with some margin.</li>
</ol>
<p>#8 has been particularly useful today. I was wrong a couple of times in
my entry but was able to breakeven because of it. Such that even being
wrong wouldn't lose me money.</p>
<p></p>
Update: the market is down a lot and it seems to be oversold. I got in a
long position near the bottom (or so I thought). This could lose me \$50
if it keeps going down after this consolidation.</p>
<p>Update 2: I indeed did enter at near the bottom and my initial stopped
of 10 pts (\$50) were never touched. Then the price just shot up to the
resistance as expected. I gradually moved my stop to trail the price
move. This trade played out as I have planned. I made a quick \$120 or
so in the few minutes. I thought of reversing direction and go short
too. But I didn't want to push for luck for the day. However, the price
is now moving down as I have guessed. It might make a new low too. Oh
well.</p>
<p>Here's a graph a few minutes after my last trade.</p>

enter a short now, I'll probably wait for a retracement. The ATR of
soybean is too much risk for me at the moment, each point move is \$50.
A bad day in soybean would pose a \$3000 paper lost even inside trading
range.</p>

simple system to cope with because of the noise. Yet, not all hopes are
lost. Swing and long term trading poses a viable alternative. In the 135
min. ER2 example above, the Stochastic and CCI signals I've been using
seem pretty reliable. I think I will focus on developing systems for
medium term (a few days) trading from now on.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to trade ER2 after today's lost from the Dow because of MM
manipulation. The big indexes are too easily manipulated and are drawing
too much attention. Too many professional players are involved in the
big indexes, so making a living out of them may be difficult.</p>
<p>ER2's 135 min ATR is about 6 - 7 points (\$600 - \$700 on the mini). The
swings can be about 80 points, or \$8000. This is too much for me at the
moment. So I'll have to wait until I can get more capital. I'm focusing
to trade Gold and Soybean for now.</p>
