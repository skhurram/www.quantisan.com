            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) tested 27.50 support and then bounced back to
break the short-term downtrend line above 28.50 or so, see Figure 1.
Naturally, I don't want to turn a profitable trade into a losing one. So
I wanted to sell <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-10jul17-puts-30-00-mx-2-45-mark-28-64/">my puts options on CVE.TO</a> while I can still exit at
near breakeven. However, as I am new to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> and unfamiliar
with their interface, I made the careless mistake of buying six more
contracts instead of selling the six that I have!</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Cenovus Energy
(CVE.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-23-CVE-TO.png" />][][/caption] I realized my mistake soon afterward from
checking my account. Imagine my surprise to find that I am an owner of
12 puts contracts on CVE.TO. So I wanted to cut my losses immediately.
Unfortunately, the energy sector (XLF) and crude oil just broke above
some key resistances and CVE.TO bumped up a few more points. The right
thing to do is to ignore my unfortunate losses and just exit the
position, as that was what I intended to do. But I didn't. I decided to
not panic and analyze the stock yet another time. CVE.TO is definitely
weak. It is lagging behind others in the sector. Other energy companies
are breaking above resistance levels but CVE.TO is still below its 29.50
resistance. Yet, the fact is that the trend in the sector is upward.
Which is very bad for me. I am still holding this short CVE.TO position
over the weekend as it hasn't broken my 29.50 mental stop yet. I can
give my bearish reasons here upon observing the tape this afternoon
(e.g. Goldman Sachs Canada is dumping shares), but they would just be
excuses under the current circumstances. In any case, this is an
embarrassing confession as I've violated one of the most <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">basic rules of
trading</a>. This position is near breakeven on paper as of the close.
But who knows what can happen over the weekend. Rather than risking 3%,
which is already too much, I am now risking a <em>maximum</em> of 10% on this
trade. What have I done... The high commission in trading options is
affecting my decision. If this were a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex</a> position, I would have
dumped it all without giving it a second thought. This is a sign for me
to stop trading options altogether. It is better to stay with a
long-only equity strategy in my RRSP than get eaten up by commissions or
take excessive risks as I am doing now.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585424331?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=quantisan-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1585424331">Think and Grow Rich</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=quantisan-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1585424331" /> (affiliate) for the third time
last weekend. One of the key ideas presented in the book is to set
realistic long term goal and stick with it every single day. This
reminded me of something that I've done lately which I think is very
helpful in disciplining myself in my trading. That something is this
table below. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-20-monetarygoal.png"><img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-20-monetarygoal.png" /></a> This is a table of my planned deposit and
return for my trading account. The table shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount that I plan to deposit into my trading account each year</li>
<li>the accumulated principal at the end of each year</li>
<li>the expected yield, which is based on my historical trading
    performance from the past 10 years of trading, minus the [couple of
    blowups I've had][] (which is a reason why I am starting from
    scratch in this table)</li>
</ul>
<p>Estimating future values is nothing new. What I find particularly useful
in this table is the fact that they show the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>My minimum savings goal for each year (deposit column). So that I
    can project an annual budget.</li>
<li>Effect of compounding. A reminder that I don't need to perform
    exquisitely in my trading to reach my goal. This helps keep my
    trading expectation realistic and not over-trade.</li>
<li>I can trade for a living after 16 years even with my conservative
    expectations. This is my ultimate goal.</li>
<li>I can update this table at the end of each year with real data so
    that I can see where I stand with respect to my goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a simple and easy to do trading goal visualization. I visualize
this table often to remind myself what I need to do. Both in terms of
setting a bar above to push myself as well as limiting my expectations
to realism. A problem many new traders have, myself included, is the
need to perform, and in a big way (making it big in that one trade), or
conversely, afraid to miss opportunities. This table helps me keep a
realistic mentality just so I don't <em>back up the truck</em> in any
particular trade. As the table clearly shows, I don't need to take
unnecessary risk to reach my goal of trading for a living. What is your
trading goal? What is your plan to achieve it? How do you keep yourself
motivated? These are some fundamental questions that this table can be
helpful in answering.</p>

today (Apr 22). I doubled down on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">my short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO)
position</a> this morning. The price of CVE.TO moved in my favour a day
after my initial short entry. It then bounced back up strongly (about
2.5% rise in a day) yesterday to test \$29.50. However, it has backed
down since. The fact that it didn't touch the \$30 price level is a good
sign. Crude Oil (CL on NYMEX) made a similar move. It tested the 50%
Fibonacci resistance at 84.5 and backed down. This is again a good sign
for my short as it signals the downtrend is a go.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Cenovus Energy
Inc. (CVE.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-21-CVE-TO.png" />][][/caption] However, crude prices became very
choppy in the afternoon today as shown in Figure 2. So perhaps there is
still room to move up. I will keep an eye on the 84.50 and 85.50
resistances for crude and 29.50 and 30.00 for CVE.TO in the coming days.
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="512" caption="Crude

this addition to my short position.</p>
<ol>
<li>this morning, the Bank of Canada gave strong hint that they will
    raise interest rate in June. However, USDCAD made a marginally new
    low briefly and then bounced back up above parity. This is bullish
    for USDCAD.</li>
<li>EnCana earnings topped estimates but the stock dived after the
    opening rush with at least 3 times morning volume as compared to the
    past five days. ECA.TO is hanging on to the 31.5 support level
    before noon but closed above it today. This is not a good sign for
    the energy sector on the TSX.</li>
</ol>
<p>A confirmation with this down move would be a break of the recent low at
\$28 for CVE.TO and \$82 for crude oil.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Dr. Steenbarger's <a href="http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2010/04/reflections-on-dr-bretts-blow-up.html">recent harddrive failure</a> reminded me about the
importance of backing up my data. Everything that I do with trading is
on the computer. Consequently, I have many files that are vital to my
trading. From web bookmarks to chart templates to source codes, I would
have to make a checklist to ensure that I backed up everything
frequently. But only if I were to do my backup manually. Being the lazy
and cheap person that I am, I don't like the idea of forcing myself to
backup frequently. That is why my folders are synchrnized automatically
to an online file server using Mozy Remote Backup. I don't have to do a
thing to know that all my important stuff are safe. There are two
reasons why I choose Mozy. It is one of the two biggest names in the
business (the other is Carbonite). It is the only one of the two to
offer <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/mozy/">a free for lifetime 2GB online backup space</a> (affiliate). The
benefit of using Mozy is that it actively synchronize my files to their
cloud storage server. These are files that I change often. It makes
sense to use Mozy to monitor and back them up automatically so that I
don't have to worry about them. Still, I have another 50GB+ of personal
photos, videos, and documents that won't fit in this free 2GB space.
Which is why I only use Mozy for my frequently changing or critical
files (mostly trading related). For the rest of my 50GB+ data, they are
typically static content (e.g. photos and media files). So there is not
much point for me to pay a monthly fee. I rather spend a few minutes a
month to make backup DVDs or upload them to my Amazon S3 account. That
way, I have all my data backed up and get to keep my \$5 a month (price
of monthly subscription fee for an unlimited storage space backup) too.
I am not being paranoid. Another one of my computers died on me a few
years back with no prior warning. Its power supply suddenly blew up in
smoke and sparks one day. The scene was quite spectacular. More than a
few components were damaged then. I doubt that I will see that kind of
fireworks again. But who knows what else could go wrong with this aging
computer (4 years and counting)? A data failure with my computer would
indeed be very costly for me. I invested a lot of time and energy on my
trading work. If my harddrive were to fail, I may lose all of that work
if I don't have a backup. That is why I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/mozy/">a free automated data
backup plan</a> which doesn't
require me to lift a finger.</p> </div>
