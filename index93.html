            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R45YbfY4unI/AAAAAAAAAGs/qWpwUsnYojU/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][] Seemed like an obvious down day today with more write downs in
the news. WSJ is reporting inflation is at 17 year high. Boeing is also
delaying their 787 delivery. So many bad news indeed.</p>
<p>Yet, the Dow decides to be up today. The futures gapped lower, but it
was quickly closed to yesterday's close. I saw that one coming from the
CCI and Stoch and was able to profit on the brief rally. It seemed
obvious that the MM are positioning themselves for the big fall.</p>
<p>I exited the long and went short on very good timing. Then the market
went on a free fall for an hour. I was holding 2 shorts of YM (one for
long term entered at market top and another one for short term, which
was added on an early consolidation). The paper profit amounted to
almost \$1300 for that hour.</p>
<p>I found myself counting the profit and becoming ecstatic of the gain.
This is when my discipline lost to my conviction. CCI and Stochastic
were obviously turning upward. I originally intended the 2nd short
position to be short term only. If I stuck to my strategy, I should have
exited at least one position when the signals were staring at my face.</p>
<p>That was indeed the bottom for the day. The market recovered and
actually went higher. This is due to the HB&amp;B moving funds (gold, tech,
oil, etc) back into the financials. They are in fact
<span style="font-weight:bold;">rotating funds out of each sector</span>
one at a time so that the indexes don't tank too fast.</p>
<p>While I was so smart to call the first rally a fakeout, I totally forgot
the same could be done on the other end! It was a double trap!!! Fake
rally, fake fall, then finally settle near prev close. This is because
most "news" from today were already discounted in the previous few days'
drop in DJIA. Buy on rumour, sell on the news!</p>
<p>I continued to trade after the big lost hoping to recover. I kept on
going short near the top but the Dow kept breaking it. After a while, I
finally dawned on me. I went long on the bottom and made a little bit
back.</p>
<p>In the end, I was down about \$500 to \$600 on YM.</p>
<p>One thing I re-learned/realized is that the morning are amateurs'
market. The afternoon are the pro's market. At least, it seems easier to
trade because there seem to be less noise in the mornings for the past
few days. My strategy seemed to have worked better in the morning too.
I'll focus on the first hour or two of the market from now on and see if
this hypothesis is true.</p>

and then lost like \$28 points in 7 hours. Daily chart shows two tail
from past two days. Volume is also a higher today on a lower close.
Stochastic and MACD looks to be turning down.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could have waited til the morning to enter the position. The
60 min. chart shows the price is going up. So I could get a better
price. I'll wait this out and not watch the price so often since this is
suppose to be a long term trade. Target price is \$865, previous
consolidation. I'll add another position if it plays out well. We'll see
tomorrow. CPI is coming out in the morning.</p>

<li>day traded YM again, ended up about \$55 for the day with 4 trades.</li>
<li>Stochastic slow crossing oversold/bought line seems to be a pretty
    good indicator. I combined it with CCI smoothed and look at the
    underlying trend to catch retracements.</li>
<li>worked a bit on the system again, but the market changes too much,
    difficult to make a catch-all system that can be consistent. I will
    continue trading manually to gain experience.</li>
<li>installed the eKam Hesitation indicator</li>
<li>Examined swing trading soybean. My system seems to work well there
    too. But risk/reward only = 10, daily range / intraday range.
    Whereas YM's risk/reward is 20. But YM is more choppy lately and S
    is swinging well.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Lesson:</span> Don't focus on
    profit. Concentrate on managing risk and the money will follow.</li>
<li>Entered a short position of YM at \$897.10 with stop at \$902.6

<p>Yesterday I was day trading too. Up about \$100. I've been working on
the system for the past couple of days, disappointing results. On the

setup is to enter on retracements. From the above YM graph, see that the
price is in a downtrend already from the 50MA (gray dotted) below 200 MA
(white dotted) lines in plot1.</p>
<p>The first vertical line denotes setup #1 for the retracement shorting
opportunity. Note the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>price is just above Keltner Channel</li>
<li>CCI stopped rising from above 100</li>
<li>Stochastic Slow crossing below signal line</li>
</ol>
<p>The second vertical line denotes setup #2, which may be weaker because
of fewer indicators alerting.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stochastic Slow crossing below 80 and just crossed signal</li>
</ol>
<p>P.S. A 200/50 MACD Histogram could replace the 2-line MA's for easier
reading. And use slowing CCI as confirmation of Stochastic crossing 20
or 80.</p>
<p></p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Update:</span> This is actually a
reversal strategy and not retracement. Retracement shouldn't end up on
the other side of the Keltner channel. See <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reversal-with-stochastic-cci-and-keltner-channel-strategy/">this newer reversal strategy
for a new adaptation.</a></p>

closed at \$897.20. The million dollar question is, with it go up or
down. This is very exciting indeed. If it goes up, \$930 seems likely to
be the target. If it breaks down though, it could launch back to \$750
(triangle low) or \$650 (flag) level. It's funny that watching the price
alone, you can see that everyone's waiting to see which way gold is
heading. The price is just hovering below \$900. Once it breaks either
way, all hell's going to break lose. I almost pulled my trigger before
the close and BET on gold going down because of lower volume, the run up
was too fast, and the low season (summer) for gold is imminent (Feb -
Aug are usually lower). It would have been a big gamble as we're heading
into the weekend so there's going to be a big gap. A lot can happen. In
the end, I didn't short gold because it's a low probability trade. It
was outright gamble.</p>
<p>Here's a picture I grabbed from <a href="http://www.goldbriefing.com/">Goldbriefing</a>, showing the flag and
triangle nicely.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Made one short trade today on YM with a profit of \$110. It was a very
good call, on both entry and exit timing. I went in as TRIX is above
zero and slowing down. Stochastic slow has just crossed its MA line.
Also the 5 min chart shows similar reveral signals from overbought zone.
In addition, the fundamental was good because yesterday's up run was
overzealous and unjustified (Bernanke's hint of rate cut in Feb) in a
sea of financial troubles lately. All signs pointed that today's market
would be down and the charts showed a good opportunity.</p>
<p>I exited when the stochastic bearly showed sign of upturn. The price
rebounded slightly. Another less probability chance for short came on
the 2nd mid level Stochastic cross under. I could have re-entered after
a small bounce at that point and made a lot more on the 2nd wave. Lesson
learned. When the stars are aligned, it's good to be greedy.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4hBmfY4ugI/AAAAAAAAAF0/Lok-FjE2Bm4/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][] I'm using TRIX and Stochastic Slow now. CCI gives more or less
the same signal as Stochastic but lags a bit more, so I got rid of it.
TRIX seems to complement Stochastic well because it gives a trend. I've
been working on a new system. It also has a few new tricks too. Such as
a window of opportunity feature so both signals doesn't have to happen
on exactly the same bar for the conditions to meet.</p>
<p>I watched the market for a while today but didn't make any trade
afterward. I didn't want to lose my winner from today. Plus, I prefer to
use an automatic system. So I continued to develop my new TRIX +
Stochastic system today based on these 2 days' experience.</p>
