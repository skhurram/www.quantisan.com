            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The major reoccurring problem I have in trading is not being objective
enough in my decision. A recent example is entering the market just
before the October crash and held on to the shares even <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/didnt-cut-losses-as-planned-and-now-paying-dearly/">when I doubted
my positions</a>. On the other hand, for the times when I executed a
trade as planned, I showed remarkable ability to make <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-of-the-day-bailed-out-of-a-wrong-position/">sound decisions
on the fly even under strenuous conditions</a>. Thus, it is in my best
interest to perform consistently and learn to be objective in my market
analysis.</p>
<p>I have come up with two solutions for my problem. 1) Make more use of
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">computational tools</a> and 2) improve my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-psychology/">trading psychology</a>.</p>
<p>In this particular post, I'd like to address my psychological barriers.
Coincidentally, a book I've been reading about conflict resolution
(Stone, et. al., "<em>Difficult Conversations</em>," pg 38+) has suggested
techniques that I think can be applied for trading.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, we argue with other people because of
difference of opinions. Similarly, we lose money in the market because
we are <em>arguing</em> with the market. The first step in conflict resolution
is understanding ourselves.</p>
<p>As best as we might try to remove emotion in our trading decision, the
tendency to develop unconsciously biased perception is very human. Our
perception about a situation is based on</p>
<ol>
<li>our selection of information</li>
<li>our interpretation</li>
<li>our conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>Some people use candlestick charts, some uses line graphs. A bullish
crossover on the RSI can mean a turn of sentiment to some or imminent
opportunity to short for others. These are just some examples of how we
add our personal touch to each problem. Indeed, I don't think
eliminating emotion from the equation is advisable. It is our
experience, our knowledge, and our skills that we should rely on to make
tough decisions. Since decisions happen so fast and generally involve
more subconscious than not, we are not aware of all the influences of
our views.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
One way to keep an unbiased opinion is to thoroughly understand how you
came to a conclusion. Why did we select one information over the other?
What assumptions are we making in an interpretation? How did we come up
with a conclusion based on our interpretations? In other words, shift
from a certain stance about our conclusion to a curious state about the
entire thinking process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One way to shift your stance from the easy certainty of feeling that
you've thought about this from every possible angle is to get curious
about what you don't know about yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping an open mind with a curious approach can help you evaluate
wether your views make sense in light of new information and
perspective.</p>
<p></p>
For example, the way I analyze a potential <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/entry/">trade entry</a> is to think
from both sides of the trade (go long or go short). Ultimately, I enter
the trade as planned if my analysis is stronger than the
counter-arguments.</p> </div>

<p>I looked at the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tested-the-pre-2000-tech-bubble-14-year-old-trendline-last-week/">20 year S&amp;P 500 monthly chart</a> last week and noted
that we're at an interesting junction in the market. Now that it's the
end of the month, I can say that we have successfully held that level
after all. The graph above is from MSN finance. It took me a while to
find a legible chart going back before the 87 crash.</p>
<p>Actually, what I have illustrated is<strong>technically wrong</strong>. I should use
a logarithmic scale instead because of the compounding effect of growth
in the economy. If we look at the chart on a logarithmic scale, we see
that we have just broken it in this year's market free fall (around
June). I guess that's another reason to the verocity of this move.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_560" align="aligncenter" width="499"

log scale" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/spx1980_log.jpg" title="spx1980_log" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>However, it is still interesting to see that we're bouncing right on the
linear scaled chart. Even though it is technically wrong to use it on
such long term chart, technical analysis itself isn't an exact science
anyway. So I'm not dogmatic with the proper use of it. <strong>As long as it
works and within logic, then it's good</strong>!</p>
<p>Update Nov 20: We broke down a major 10-year support yesterday at 820 on

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The fundamental for \$1000+ Gold is certainly in place, like the free
money handout that's been going on in many countries and the global
financial panic. Conventional wisdom says in times of trouble, hoard as
much gold as you can. I still believe Gold and Silver will break their
previous highs from earlier this year.</p>
<p>Yet, I don't have a Swiss bank account to hoard physical gold nor have I
got the financial means to even purchase <a href="http://www.pmcg.com.au/">mint-backed gold
certificates</a>. I am merely a small time trader on the market. One rule
of the tradebook I learned by experience is that it's good to <strong>live by
an independent perspective on the market, but don't die by it</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at the gold and silver charts though, it is blatantly obvious
that we're in a severe downtrend lately, for whatever reasons. The small
rally this week may be tempting for some perma-bull or the
fundamentalists. But I wouldn't enter the commodities market at this
point without some price-volume confirmation.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we look at the gold chart. We see that the current rally is
probably a retracement. It has tested its resistance at 780 and backed
down already.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_537" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="Gold"][<img alt="Gold" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/2008-10-30-gold.jpg" title="2008-10-30-gold" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the silver camp is looking better. We are seeing a
positive divergence in both the RSI and MACD in the latest down leg.
This is caused by the more severe fall of silver since its high earlier.
The silver down leg hasn't had a chance to catch a breath like gold has.
In fact, I would watch for an upside break in Silver regardless of the
move in Gold. I don't know would this be possible and sustainable,
silver going up while gold going down.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_538" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="Silver"][<img alt="Silver" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/2008-10-30-silver.jpg" title="2008-10-30-silver" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Sometimes it's easy to forget that gold and silver are two commodities
with two different prices. That is because gold and silver price
correlation is very high and have generally moved together for many
fundamental reasons. However, there are periods of time when the
Gold/Silver ratio make drastic changes.</p>
<p>The G/S ratio has been around 55 - 65 in the past 5 years. G/S ratio
runs higher in times of trouble when people purchase gold as a safety
shelter to store value. In the tech bubble, G/S went above 80 around
2003. The highest in the past 40 year occured after the 1987 crash, in
1990 when G/S got to 100.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_539" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="Historical Gold/Silver Ratio (snatched from
www.gold-eagle.com)"][<img alt="Historical Gold/Silver Ratio" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/gsr-gm.gif" title="gsr-gm" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>While the absolute price of Gold and Silver has been counter-intuitive,
the G/S ratio picture still fits well with the norm. Notice the spike
starting in August 2008? When the financial troubles we're in now is
written all over the wall? (Actually, the writing on the wall appeared
late last year already, but that's another story.) The faster fall of
Silver lately could be explained with this. If that's the case, then
both Gold and Silver could continue its downtrend.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_536" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="Gold/Silver price ratio"][<img alt="Gold/Silver price
ratio" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/gold-silver.png" title="gold-silver" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>So what's my point in this post? I don't really have one. I am just
saying what's in my mind about Gold and Silver in this recent
counter-intuitive trend. In terms of the prices, I am still bullish on
gold and silver in the looong term. And definitely bearish in the short
term. When will they move up? I don't know, just observe the market. But
I see silver to have more upside if it were to go up. It could easily
creep up to \$12 from here.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>While I haven't written about my stance on the flood of bailouts, I have
been against it all along. Pouring tax payers' <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122540927284586151.html">money into a select few
elites</a> in the name of <em>helping</em> the economy has sank my respect for
the American government to a new low. This is just like the Bush's
Weapons of Mass Destruction lies and the subsequent Iraq invasion all
over again, only on an epic scale and the effect much more encompassing.
However, the situation have reached a new low. In today's news, there's
talk of banks asking for credit card debt forgiveness. They might as
well just hand out each American a million dollar cheque. Then watch the
American dollar become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar">Zimbobwe money</a> and plunge America back to the
Medieval era when people would barter for their goods. The sheer
stupidity of this move is below even that of Bush's intelligence! If
what the U.S.A. is doing lately isn't socialism, then I don't know what
is. That is one huge factor why I've been long gold and silver with my
accumulating position in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">SLW</a>. It looks as though we might be in for
a continued downtrend in precious metal prices. But sooner or later,
prices will reflect their true values. Update: The Big Picture made a
post about <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/10/moral-hazard-of.html">mortgage bailouts</a> today on the same issue. Barry puts the
issue of bailing out bad debts succinctly, "moral hazard not only
encourages recklessness, it leads to people looking to avoid
responsibility for bad decisions."</p> </div>
