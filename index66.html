            <div class="article-content"> <p>On another note,<a href="http://xtrends.blogspot.com/2009/03/what-will-be-different-this-time.html">xTrends pointed to GE</a> as being a great upcoming
short play. Look at the long term chart below, daily on left and weekly
on right.</p>
<p>First on the daily to the left, we have increasing price and decreasing
volume since the climb from the bottom. Stochastic is making a bearish
crossover in the upper half (would have been nice if it's higher). And
every time it does that in the past year, GE goes sliding down. Volume
weighted MACD is also showing a negative divergence. GE is stalling
above \$10 but its V-MACD is higher than previously in the \$10 zone.</p>
<p>As for the weekly chart on the right, it's obvious GE is in a major
downtrend. And so is everything else. However, compared to the S&amp;P 500
it is certainly lagging on this recent rally in the past month or so.
That is certainly a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>Update: I like it enough that I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">entered a strangle order for GE
around \$10-11</a>. It's going to pop one way or the other.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>No, I haven't unloaded my GS short yet. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-gs-100-apr-09-105-put-872/">I said I would unload it if GS
manage to stay above \$110</a>. But it closed at \$110.60 yesterday. I
can live with a \$0.60 difference.</p>
<p>I watched GS for most of the day yesterday. It's action above \$110 seem
a bit lackluster. Looking at the chart, particularly the daily, you can
see the sword-like candlestick from yesterday. There's probably a name
for it, but I don't remember. Add to that, S&amp;P500 just tested 820
resistance yesterday.</p>
<p>GS's move above \$110 is certainly interesting. The correct play would
be for it to break below \$110 and then observe the pullback, then if
it's weak, that would have been the right time to pound on the short
selling button. Or we could just buy a strangle at this point...</p>
<p>Since I entered pre-maturely on Monday, I'm going to wait this out
because the risk/reward ratio is still very high. At least now I know
\$115 would be my stop and my potential loss.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Once again, I find myself on the other side of the fence. I entered a
short at 10:42am today thinking the gap up is unsustainable. Well, not
only has S&amp;P500 broken 800, it's now resting above 820. Goldman Sachs
(GS) was about 106.50 when I entered the short. GS closed at 111.93
today. I'm down \$210 already. If GS can stay above this 200 day MA at
\$110 later tomorrow, then I'm out.</p>

<p>As you can see, GS went vertical upward once it broke the morning
resistance at \$17.30. The reason for my entry in the morning was
because GS seemed like it was having difficulty breaking \$17.
Furthermore, S&amp;P 500 also seemed hesitant around 800. So I guessed it'd
be reasonable to see a pullback.</p>
<p>However, I failed to take into account today's humongous gap up open. It
would have been counter-productive if we're to close the gap on the
weekend's hype up. This is pretty much a reverse of what we've seen
seeing for the past few months. Panic begets panic. But in today's case,
it's panic of missing the rally train that'll fuel this possibly new leg
of a rally.</p>
<p>My second mistake is trading on lack of information. I traded using the
mobile platform and by just looking at the Google Finance charts. If I
had access to my intraday sentiment chart, I could have easily seen that
the morning momentum remained strong even when S&amp;P was stalling around
800.</p>
<p>Lastly, I really should stick to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/market%20analysis/">my own analysis</a> and not trade on a
spontaneous urge. I did say in the morning that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/beginning-of-another-bull-phase-asian-markets-are-on-fire/">we'll break down if we
fail to maintain 800</a>. Even at the time of my short entry, we were
indeed holding on to the 800 zone. Thus, I have basically shot myself in
the foot for not listening to myself.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Nikkei (+3.39%), Hang Seng (+4.78%), Shanghai (+1.95%), All Ordinaries
(+2.29%), just to name a few. Every asian market is up 2 - 4% on Monday.
Fueled by these new influx of cash, the S&amp;P emini is up about 20 points
to 784! There're certainly a lot of excitement in the air today. Heck, I
felt like wanting to chase the gap up for TCK too. TCK is now trading
around \$5 in the pre-market.</p>
<p>But no, I shall <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-march-22-2009/">stick with my plan</a> and be patience. I will be
disciplined and wait for the critical 800 level to materialize then
watch how the market reacts at that level. All this excitement means
nothing if we can't even push above 800 in this bull phase. <strong>If the
market fails to push above 800 in this leg of optimism (within next few
days), then it's the more reason we're heading down deep</strong>. On the other
hand, if this really is the start of another bull run, then I'll
definitely be missing a lot of action. But heck, I'd rather be safe.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>We have touched the 800 point on the S&amp;P500 and bounced back as everyone
expected.  We are still within [last weekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s predicted

to break the downtrend since October, see Figure 2.   In fact, I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-277-tck-487/">unloaded my TCK longs</a> just after the test of 800.  I am now focusing
on finding my best bets for the next leg up.</p>
<p>Rather than ending here as usual, I will analyze the various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GICS">GICS

<p><strong>GICS SECTORS REVIEW</strong></p>
<p>Below are the 6-month, 1-month, and 1-week graphic comparison of the
performance of GICS10: energy (XLE), GICS15: materials (XLB), GICS20:
industrials (XLI), GICS25: consumer discretionary (XLY), GICS30:
consumer staples (XLP), GICS35: healthcare (XLV), GICS40: financial
(XLF), GICS45: technology (XLK), GICS:50 telecommunication (IYZ), and
GICS55: utilities (XLU).</p>
<p>Evidently, the ball is with the financials for the past few months. 
They have led the turn down (6-month chart) and also the bounce (1-month
chart).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Financial again were leading the pack in the rally. 
However, Energy kept the ball rolling on Thursday while the Financial
were drifting down.  At the other end of the spectrum, Healthcare and
Utilities are against the flow as usual.</p>

<p>In terms of guessing whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to come next week. 
LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s take a closer look at the financial.  As you can
see, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re hanging by a tread right at the support at
the moment.  So <strong>if XLF is to break this support here,
itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to take the whole market with it</strong>.  Then,
weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be breaking the 750 support for the S&amp;P 500 and
go back to the 600ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s range as IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve
been saying for the past 2 weeks.  This is definitely one scenario which
I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like it to happen.  As always,
letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s see how the market acts next week and go with the
flow.  Again, watch the 750 and 800 zones.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I took some time today during lunch to study the move of TCK. TCK made
it above \$5.00 in the morning with mediocre volume. Then I watched it
break above \$5 again around noon and it was disappointingly
unspectacular. This isn't a good sign. On top of this, S&amp;P 500 seems to
be on the verge of breaking below the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/pre-market-analysis-march-20-2009/">support of 780 as I've noted in
the morning pre-market analysis</a>. So I decided to place a stop to
close my long-held position at \$4.87, just below yesterday's intra-day
trough at \$4.88. TCK was marked at \$4.98 or so at the time.</p>
<p>Then at 13:19, my stop was triggered. Two hours later, TCK is now
trading at \$4.65. The S&amp;P is holding out at 770, which isn't all that
bad. Perhaps this is just a shakeout before another leg of this bull
run. Perhaps 800 was indeed the end of this leg of the rally. I'm not
sure at the moment. What matters is that [from my analysis, there is a
higher risk than reward expectancy at the moment][]. So I'm just saving
my chips rather than risk them over the weekend.</p>
