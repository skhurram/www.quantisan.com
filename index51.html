            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been seriously studying the forex market for the past couple of
weeks. This post is my first official jab in this area.</p>
<p>What better way than to start with the USD/CAD currency pair as I'm a
Canadian myself. And it just so happens that the USD/CAD is at a major
pivot these past couple of months. See Figure 1.</p>
<p>The fall of the USD/CAD from a peak around 1.60 in 2003 to below 0.90 in
2007 has been unforgettable. In fact, USD/CAD is still trading around
its shadow as seen in the test of both the resistance and support
Fibonacci fan lines (Figure 1).</p>
<p>While I'm not ready to predict which way the pair will trend (something
that rhymes with yup), it's clear that the fight between 1.0868 - 1.093
will be an important battle. Breaking below or above it would cause a
sizable short term move.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market made a new high for the year on Friday. There's no doubt that
the current trend is very bullish with the recent relentless climb since
March. See Figure 1.</p>
<p>However, why was 1025 on the S&amp;P500 (for example) so hard to break?
Since the market doesn't operate in a vacuum. Here's a look at S&amp;P500
ETF (SPY) v. the U.S. dollar (Figure 2) and v. Gold (Figure 3) for some
insights.</p>
<p>To invest in the U.S. market is a bet on the U.S. market (well
obviously) as well as the U.S. dollar. Because we're trading with U.S.
dollar in the U.S. market, its fluctuation will affect your return too.
Figure 2 is a chart of SPY divided by the U.S. dollar index (an
aggregate of the U.S. dollar v. other major currencies). In effect, it's
a normalized SPY chart with regards to the global currencies (and thus,
more or less the economies). As you can see, we just broke through a
long term resistance at 1.30 but is testing a Fibonacci level.</p>
<p>Similarly, the value of Gold is often used as a metric for currencies.
i.e. how much money is actually worth. Figure 3 is a chart of SPY
divided by the price of Gold. In effect, a normalized SPY chart with
regards to the real value of the U.S. dollar (since price of Gold is in
U.S. dollar).</p>
<p>Figure 3 is more telling. Although we've been moving higher and higher
in the raw SPY, you can clearly see that SPY/\$GOLD has been hitting a
ceiling since July. In other words, the market is going up because the
value of U.S. dollar is going down versus the companies these equities
represent.</p>
<p>While there's been much <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32506152/ns/business-stocks_and_economy/">talk of economic recovery</a> and a new <a href="http://online.barrons.com/article/SB125089288451150335.html">bull
market</a> is already with us, I still am not convinced just yet. True,
the bears might be MIA. But all signs say that this bull we're seeing is
standing on thin ice.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My limit order was executed at the open today for Capital One Financial
(COF). I placed this yesterday at the close and totally forgot about
it...</p>
<p>While we are testing a long term resistance (Figure 1, pink trendline at
top of chart) at about \$36, there is no confirmation yet. The recent
bullish momentum could very well sweep COF along to break it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a look at S&amp;P normalized by US Dollar Index shows the
market is also pushing up against a significant resistance. I will make
another post about this after the close today as a market analysis.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the divergence in sentiment based on high yield stocks or junk
bonds v. market price is as obvious as ever. Although this has been the
case for a while now, so this perspective doesn't hold much weight
anymore. The market simply can be irrational beyond anyone's guess.</p>
<p>Entry: \$35.89</p>
<p>Stop: Above \$35.00, by next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Target: \$33, by next week.</p>
<p>I've updated my risk metric for options to incorporate the time
parameter. A more thorough analysis can be gleaned from Figure 3 with
the expected value of the options at 1, 2, and 3 weeks from now.</p>
<p>To be more precise, the Profit/Loss on August 28 is -\$41.5 if COF =
\$36, and +\$110.6 if COF = \$33.</p>
<p>So the Reward / Risk = \$110.6 / \$41.5 = 2.7 \&lt; 5. The R/R is
predictably horrible. That's why I'm setting a tight stop on this. We'll
see how today's push higher plays out and I'll probably ditch this
sooner to minimize my risk.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've finally liquidated my COF shorts. The bid/ask was 0.25/0.35 and I
placed a limit order at 0.30. It was executed immediately. This leads me
to believe we'll be heading much lower today because of the market's
eagerness to take my puts.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for dumping these puts. First, is that the August
expiry is this Friday. The time decay this week has been brutal. <strong>A new
rule for options trading is that close any long options before the last
8 days or so til expiry.</strong> From then, the time decay really accelerates.</p>
<p>Secondly, we gapped lower today at the market, but there is no follow
through to the weakness at all. In fact, the market is making a
logarithmic rise and holding above 985 on the S&amp;P by 10:30am. The TICK
has also crossed +800 multiple times; whereas the lowest we've got so
far in the TICK is -728.</p>
<p>With the support for COF at \$34.00, there is very little I have to gain
when the market overall is holding above 985 and seem to be going higher
as of now. So I've decided to dump this position.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-cof-100-aug-09-33-put-2-20-mark-32-10/">purchased these puts at 2.20 about two weeks ago</a>. Total loss.
\$380 + \$15 = \$395. This is yet another trade that got away from me. I
am now going to limit my trading until I can find my edge again.</p>
<p>One mistake I've been making is neglecting the market environment. For
one, we've been in a bull market until proven otherwise (probably not
anymore since last Friday). Second, the market has been very choppy and
trading in a range this month. These are factors that I need to consider
in my future trades.</p>

longs this week</a> before expiration. My opportunity came today when PG
broke \$52.50 twice but failed to hold it for long. The time decay is
eating the premium fast this week, so seeing that it's unlikely PG will
make a spike higher now, so I'm unloading my August calls for it.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-pg-100-aug-09-52-5-call-60-mark-52-16/">bought these calls for \$0.60 last week</a> to hedge my shorts. This

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>It doesn't look like that the market will correct any time soon. The pre
and post FOMC action today merely produced a few points of move on the
S&amp;P500. However, with the S&amp;P500 making a marginally new high, the high
risk sectors (i.e. financial XLF and real estate IYR) are still off
their highs by much. Furthermore, the junk bonds (JNK) is failing to
lift too. This is a good sign that the junk of the market aren't being
bidded for. This is definitely a negative divergence. However, things
aren't always that easy. From that lack of participation either way,
we'll likely move within a range for a while. So <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-cof-100-aug-09-33-put-2-20-mark-32-10/">my COF short</a> is in
threat of expiring. The move for me now is to unload both COF and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-pg-100-aug-09-52-5-call-60-mark-52-16/">my
hedge in PG long</a> before expiration next week. I bought Brunswick Corp
(BC) for September's expiration because some meaningful move is likely,
particularly considering the scenario BC is in now. Looking at Figure 2,
BC has tested a solid long term resistance about \$10. It has tanked
more than 4% today while the market is up about 1% and marked a new
intraday high. And in case you haven't noticed, BC has been going
through wild cycles of ups and downs. Those patterns are looking darn
nice if this is indeed the top for BC. We can expect BC to be breaking
below \$6 if history plays itself out once again. Furthermore, the
intraday push to resistance at 9.25 has failed miserably in the late day
(Figure 3). That was when I decided to enter this position. Entry:
\$9.12 Stop: \$9.70 Target: \$6.00 Reward / Risk = 3.12 / 0.58 = 5.4 >
5 Note: Because these are farther out options, my risk is definitely
higher than this simple calculation depicts because of the time decay. I
will need to figure out a simple way of better assessing my risk other
than using Black-Scholes manually. P.S.: Forget to mention that I picked
up this tip for BC from <a href="http://caracommunity.com/content/caras-commentary-community-chat-wednesday-aug-12-2009#comment-41326">Cara Community</a>. [caption
