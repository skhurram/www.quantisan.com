    <div class='article-content'>
        <p>I paid a price last week in trading EURCHF for not knowing the
fundamental analysis about the currency pair. First of all, here's how
my trade played out. The support between 1.500 and 1.510 is apparent if
you look at Figure 1. So I went long as shown in Figure 2 (second blue
triangle from right) based on a positive divergence at a strong support
of 1.510. EURCHF stayed range bound for a over a day while my other
positions were having roller coaster rides. That's when I decided to
tighten up my stop on my EURCHF long from 1.508 to 1.5095 to limit my
risk exposure. As you can see in Figure 2, that was a bad decision. On
October 30, EURCHF made a swing downward to take out the nearby stops
and then launched upward right past my target. That would have been a
quick and low risk play if I hadn't micro-manged the trade and moved my
stop up while the daily setup was still sound. While getting stopped out
is part of the game, as there is never absolute certainty in a trade.
But in this case, the probability of this up move was substantially
greater than I would have guessed. The extra bit of information lies
outside of the chart. It seems that there is a well known secret that
the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been intervening in the market to keep
the Swiss Franc from being even more overvalued. In particular, it's
well known that the SNB has their eyes on the 1.50 and 1.51 levels in
the EURCHF pair. SNB publicly announced their intention to intervene on
March 12. Immediately following the news, the EURCHF pair exploded up
470 pips in 20 minutes that day. If you look at Figure 1, you can see
that gigantic bar on March 12. The DailyFX has an article on this
<a href="http://www.dailyfx.com/story/bio1/Swiss_Franc_Plunges_After_SNB_1236870114798.html">monumental event</a>. Since then, the SNB has been coming to the rescue
of EURCHF in very obvious ways as shown in Figure 1 with the regular
spikes in prices. Prior to this October 30 move, EURCHF had an identical
price action exactly a month before on September 29, as shown in Figure
3. Back then, EURCHF also had a positive divergence on a test of support
at 1.5080. Then next thing you know, the pair popped over a 100 pips.
Obviously, the SNB is trying hard to paint the tape on the monthly chart
of EURCHF. As I was saying, the SNB is intervening in the market to keep
their currency from further over-valuation, which is hurting their local
economy. In both cases of Sept 29 and Oct 30, if the support was broken,
EURCHF would have stepped into a grave on the chart. Just look at that
huge vacuum below 1.50 on Figure 1. In this recent case on Oct 30, even
though I did go long because of the chart, I didn't have the edge of
knowing this information. Which led me missing this easy ride because I
didn't have as much conviction in this trade as I should have.
Coincidentally, as I have been aggravating to improve the win rates of
my trades, this came hitting me right on the head. So while I'm no
economist, I should at least be aware of the fundamental forces at play
in the currencies that I trade. At the end of the day, technical
analysis may provide guidelines to the mass psychology behind price
actions, but it is the fundamental and economic forces that are
ultimately driving the market. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"
