<p>I'd like to document a useful technique I picked up today from Tom
Sosnoff on <a href="http://shadowtrader.net/">ShadowTrader</a>. It's based on the idea that option pricing
has become so efficient that it can be used to predict actual stock
move.</p>
<p>Since it is expiration Friday this week, the Oct 08 index option are
expiring in two days. So for something like, SPX, the Oct 08 call/put
has only two days left. Thus, there's little time decay factored in the
price for these options with respect to the actual price. In other
words, SPX and SPX options prices are converging.</p>
<p>So if we take the price of the straddle and strangle strike on the
money, it should be the expected move for SPX for this Friday. For
example, SPX closed at 907.84 today. The price for a straddle at 905
strike is \$48.65. The price for a strangle at 900/910 strikes is
\$45.30. We'll average the two numbers (\$48.65 + \$45.30) / 2 = \$47.0.</p>
<p>So the SPX is expected to move about 50 points this Friday either up or
down.</p>

<p>It's time to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/eslr-testing-long-term-low/">review my positions as promised last week</a>. After the
record up day on Monday and then the lackluster follow-through Tuesday,
today is probably going to be a down day in the markets. Given <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/mid-week-market-review-october-15-2008/">my
intermediate term outlook</a>, I am inclined to hold my positions.
However, I need to unload my weakest link to reduce my risk.</p>
<p>Above is a quick snapshot of my current holdings.</p>
<p>Notice that DELL and ESLR are holding on nicely on this down (DJX
-3.18%, SPX -3.57% as of this writing) day after the previous spike.
This is a very good sign indeed as it shows they're likly to hold on to
the previous \~20% gain, at least for now.</p>
<p>Actually, the price action of ESLR seem very healthy in particular.
There's been a couple of big volume spikes in late day trading. Although
it does seem to be in a constant downtrend, as you can see from its
chart.</p>
<p>As for CAF and SLW they are both below support at the moment. CAF has
broken its \$25 support last Friday and is trading below it at the
moment. SLW is definitely the weakest at the moment. If it isn't such a
cash cow, I would probably be selling it in yesterday's rally.
Furthermore, it still seems to be holding on to its decending support
line on the daily chart today.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_377" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>At this point, the question I ask myself is, if I'm in all cash now,
would I be buying these companies at this point? CAF - yes, DELL - yes,
ESLR - yes, SLW - yes. Is this the bottom? I don't know. I'll just have
to wait and see. However, I will watch the day-to-day action of my
holdings carefully and unload one of two of them to reduce my risk.</p>

[![S&P 500 review][]][]
:   S&P 500 review

</div>

<p></p>
I have been waiting to go long in this bear market for a few weeks now,
hoping for a bottom soon (first of my errors).  Then on week of
September 29th, I decided to go all in (error #2).  S&amp;P closed at 1099
that Friday.  A week later, on October 10th, the Friday close of S&amp;P 500
was 899 points, and I am still left holding on (error #3).</p>
<p>Error #4 though, requires some explaination.  Simply put, I was not
reading the chart as I should have.  While both the price action and
contrarian sentiments were bullish, I totally missed out on a basic
technical analysis indicator ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â? the volume.  Looking at
the above chart, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to see that the first
downward break of the trendline in mid-September was confirmed with
volume.  The volume on that day (left blue arrow), and for that entire
week, is substantially higher than usual.  The subsequent mini rally
attempt before the next break has been marked with little volume.  This
suggests that market participants, particularly the longs, still
havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t flocked in yet.</p>
<p>Seeing that, I [should at least reduce my position size by exiting some
of my most weak positions][] (i.e. least profitable positions) before
the weekend.</p>
<p>While this is not my costliest lesson in trading, it illustrates some
very fundamental lessons which I should <strong>reiterate</strong>, because I should
have known better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Never try to pick the top or bottom.  Which I thought I learned from
    my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures trading</a> already.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/">Manage risk according to volatility</a>.</li>
<li>Exit at any cost if it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look right in a bear
    market.</li>
<li>DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get fixated on the individual stocks, look at
    the bigger picture.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
Actually, I think this all boils down to proper <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>.</p>

<a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/10102008/watch.html">intellectual discussion of the current market crisis</a>. Highly
recommended for anyone seeking to make some sense of the current
turmoil.</p>
<p>
Here's an exerpt:

> **GEORGE SOROS:**And it's a false ideology. Both Marxism and market

<blockquote>
<p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>Is there an ideology that...</p>
<p><strong>GEORGE SOROS:</strong>Is not false?</p>
<p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>GEORGE SOROS:</strong>I think the only one is the one that I'm proposing;
namely, the recognition that all our ideas, all our human constructs
have a flaw in it. And perfection is not attainable. And we must
engage in critical thinking and correct our mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>And that's one...</p>
<p><p>
<strong>GEORGE SOROS:</strong>That's my ideology. As a child, I experienced
Fascism, the Nazi occupation and then Communism, two false ideologies.
And I learned that both of those ideologies are false. And now I was
shocked when I found that even in a democracy people can be misled to
the extent that we've been misled in the last few years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a bit about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_soros">George Soros from Wikipedia</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soros' 2008 book, <em>The New Paradigm for Financial Markets</em>, describes
a "superbubble" that has built up over the past 25 years and is now
ready to collapse. This is the third in a series of books he's written
that have predicted disaster. As he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><div>
</p>
<p>
I have a record of crying wolfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. I did it first in
<em>The Alchemy of Finance</em> (in 1987), then in <em>The Crisis of Global
Capitalism</em> (in 1998) and now in this book. So it's three books
predicting disaster. (After) the boy cried wolf three times . . .
the wolf really came.
</div></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his
predictions are wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><div>
</p>
<p>
<strong>I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong</strong>*ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ I
basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often
used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you
are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight. When [I] make the
decision, the backache goes away.

<p>With VIX at a multi-year high and the current market turmoil, it seems
to be a good time to write about market volatility.</p>
<p>Market volatility is a two-edged sword. Day traders dream of catching
the 800 point swing in the YM contracts. Yet, most would lose more being
stopped out before giving up and then missing the swing. For long term
traders, these 800 point swing could cause panic (if you're on the wrong
side) or doubts (should you or should you not take the profit?).</p>
<p>Based on my brief experience in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/day-trading/">day trading</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures markets</a>,
I am not one to play with fire. For my longer term plays, I am <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/didnt-cut-losses-as-planned-and-now-paying-dearly/">feeling
the pain as we speak</a>. Thus, it is important to realize that although
market <em>volatility is very tempting for quick profits, greed never pays
in trading</em>. Another characteristic in a highly volatile market is that
there're a lot of emotions going on. As you know, emotions can cloud our
judgement. It's more difficult to trade when you're filled with panic,
fear, greed, excitement, etc.</p>
<p>In other words, market volatility is bad because 1) large swings both
ways at any time and 2) lots of emotions in the market and yourself.</p>
<p>To minimize your risk, it's better to minimize your exposure to the
market at times of high volatility. Thus, I use the rule that...</p>
<p><strong>If 50 dma of VIX > 20, then reduce position size to some % (i.e. 50%)
of usual amount.</strong></p>
<p>As a corollary, here's another interesting idea. It's widely known that
markets tend to creep up and plunge down, i.e. rising slow and steadily,
and fall quick and hard. Looking at the 50 dma VIX, it's actually a
quicker indicator for the 2007 top than my previous <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/back-to-basics-market-sentiment-via-2-line-ema-on-sp500/">2-line EMA
indicator for market sentiment</a>. Conceptually, if we accept that bull
market is slow and bear market is fast, then this idea of using VIX to
signal bull/bear sentiment do seem viable. However, there's already too
many IF's and assumptions for me to take this seriously. Therefore,
let's just stick with using volatility for managing position sizing
only.</p>

<p>One of the most, if not THE most, important theme in trading is
identifying if we're in a bull or bear market. It's easier to "ride with
the wave" than to fight against it. While there are an abundance of
work, studies, theories, or whatever, on calling out market sentiments,
I feel that the most useful way of doing it would be ones that stick to
the facts. And the only fact we can be certain of in the market is the
price.</p>
<p>So here's the idea (definitely not original) for <strong>guessing</strong> market
sentiment.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bull market = 50 dma > 200 dma for S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>Bear market = 50 dma \&lt; 200 dma for S&amp;P 500.</li>
</ol>
<p>As with any indicator, this is not a law. It's just a signal to give you
a piece of information for you to <strong>intrepret</strong> based on the
fundamentals and maybe other technical analysis tools.</p>
