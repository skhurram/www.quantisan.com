            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This month has been a roller coaster in both the markets and my account
balance (see Figure 1). Here's a quick recap of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trades</a> in
the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex markets</a> for November. I started out by cashing the carried
over long yen and dollar positions from October. Those trades could have
been better as I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-good-trade-that-could-have-been-great-a-lesson-to-take-profit-at-target/">lamented in a post</a>. Nevertheless, it was a
good start for the month. Then, things went downhill for me; literally,
as you can see from my account balance at the first half of the month in
Figure 1. I tried my luck <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-bad-eurusd-day-trading-and-what-to-do-about-it/">day trading EUR/USD with horrible results</a>.
I marked this particular period of drawdown from these EUR/USD day
trades on Figure 1 with a red band. The fear lingered on and I gave up
all the initial gain of the month to scrap just below the opening
balance. Fortunately, I was able to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-example-of-how-trading-in-fear-is-bad-for-your-account/">realize my problem</a> and clean up
my act. I recuperated by documenting <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-0122-sl-1-0060-tp-1-0225/">each</a> <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-audjpy-81-22-sl-80-99-tp-82-50/">of my</a> <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-out-audjpy-longs-81-3-7-pips-and-81-29-28-pips/">entry</a> like I
used to to force myself to think more and trade less. The turnaround
didn't happen immediately. Not until I became even more stringent on
myself and stuck with using only my best setup, the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC setup</a>. I
marked this period on Figure 1 with the green bar and arrow. As you can
see, I happened to be in the right markets and at the right times to
make a full recovery back to the top. In fact, I made <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/audjpy-short-81-3777-17-anatomy-of-my-first-400-pips-trade/">my first 400+
pips trade</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/eurusd-95-pips-in-2-hours-an-example-of-swing-and-day-trade-convergence/">my best EUR/USD day trade</a> during this comeback. I
thought I could finish the month above the critical \$5500 level (10%
gain). But a couple small losers on the last day pulled my account below
it yet again. However, one lesson I became even more aware of from the
draw-down is to forget about your account balance. Focus on making good
trades, manage your risks, and the money will take care of itself.

<h2>Performance Statistics</h2>
<p>Attached below are my performance statistics for November. The first
number is this month's and the second number in bracket is from October
for comparison. I will highlight and comment on the few discrepancies
that I find important. Sarting Fund \$5,089.06 End of Month Fund
\$5,302.21 Total Net Profit \$166.90 (\$213.15) Gross Profit \$598
(\$499) Gross Loss -\$431 (-\$285) Profit Factor 1.39 (1.75) Net Profit
% 3.15% (4.19%) Max. Drawdown % <strong>3.44%</strong> (2.32%) This draw-down is
horrible to say the least. Kurtosis <strong>3.45</strong> (8.53) Skewness <strong>1.54</strong>
(2.49) Sharpe Ratio <strong>16.64</strong> (5.21) The kurtosis and skewness are
surprisingly good. A low, but not near-zero numbers are preferable. The
Sharpe ratio is also surprisingly good too. This isn't because my return
is good, is just that the standard deviation return of my trades have
been very consistent. Ironically, that's mostly because of steady small
losses (see Figure 1). 95th Percentile P&amp;L \$23.20 (\$70.11) 5th
Percentile P&amp;L -\$10.31 (-\$33.60) Net Profit Mid 90% Only <strong>\$33.82</strong>
(\$46.34) I failed to meet <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/october-2009-trading-performance-review/">my goal from last month</a> to increase my
mid-90% return. It would have been easily met if I didn't go crazy with
the day trades and loose a bundle. Total # of Trades <strong>153</strong> (34)
Percent Profitable 47.06% (44.12%) # of Winning Trades 72 (15) # of
Losing Trades 81 (19) I started to make use of scaling in and out of a
trade. So sometimes one trade would be counted as 2 or 3 small ones.
Still, I made too many trades this month. Even if I consider a 2 for 1
ratio of trades (i.e. 153 / 2 = 76), it is still more than twice as many
as last month. My net profit is lower too. Wasted time and effort for
lower return. <strong>Lesson for the month is clearly to think more and trade
less</strong>. Average Trade Profit % 0.02% (0.12%) Average Winning % <strong>0.16</strong>%
( 0.66%) Average Losing % <strong>-0.10</strong>% (-0.30%) Ratio Win% / Loss% 1.57
(2.21) This could be the most worrisome statistics for me this month. My
average winning percentage from a trade is significantly less. <strong>I need
to be more aggressive when I am right to reap the most reward from it</strong>.
Stash in the cash as the position gets greener! Max. Conseq. Winners 12
(4) Max. Conseq. Losers 14 (6) Largest Winning Trade \$41.88 (\$171.79)
Largest Losing Trade -\$20.34 (-\$44.17) Avg. Time Held [hrs] 0.56
(2.18)</p>
<h2>Goal for Next Month</h2>
<p>Let's start by saying what I did well this month. I think my comeback
was phenomenal, but definitely with luck on my side. I approached my
huge draw-down systematically and rationally by reducing position size,
trading less, and restricted myself by using my best <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setup</a>
only. Then when the time was right, I was able to pound on the winning
positions. I will need to remember this the next time I'm experiencing a
draw-down (hopefully not as much as this month's). On the other hand, I
made many trading mistakes this month. Most were just short-term
problems and I have already written about them in my lessons. Upon
further review of my performance this month, two major problems are
evident as discussed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Think more and trade less. Limit my trades to approximately one a
    day and know when to NOT trade at all. Not even with tiny positions
    to "test the water" as I like to do.</li>
<li>Be more aggressive when the position is right. Achieve this by
    improving on my scaling in and out strategy by accelerating the
    scaling in and decelerating on the scaling out.</li>
</ol>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>A problem I have is that once a currency pair shows a viable trading
setup, other related pairs often show the same setup too. A reason for
this phenomenon is that markets don't operate in a vacuum. When markets
really move, everything move together. So the highly correlated markets
can scream for entry at the same time. The real question though, is
which one should I put my chips in? There are limitless methods on how
you can approach this. The one I'll talk about in this post is a simple
method of comparing your candidates using the currency futures. Why use
the futures? Because they provide a standardized platform, which is
essential when comparing things. As a bonus, there is a US dollar index
futures to help with analysis of the dollar. Not a trivial process on
its own. I will explain my method by way of an example. This morning, I
was considering to go long in AUD/JPY, CAD/JPY, AUD/USD, or short
USD/CAD according to signals from my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC setup</a>. Sure, I could have
just choose which one to trade based on the RSI rating or some other
indicator. But I don't put much faith in indicators for various reasons.
So a method I typical use is to just go through the charts to manulally
identify which has better reward/risk or better support/resistance. As
you can imagine, this is very time consuming. In practice, I only
compare AUD/JPY vs. CAD/JPY and AUD/USD vs. USD/CAD, and then compare
the winners of those two matches. Like in a tournament. Not that much of
a hassle but the issue with this approach is that I'm adding another
layer of uncertainty with all these unscientific comparisons. That could
have a significant negative impact on my trading. In a good trading
strategy, every step taken should be to improve your probability of
success or the reward/risk ratio. As such, it's better to keep my
process simple. This is where the currency futures indices is of value.
They provide a big picture perspective and serve as a standardized data
for comparison. Using my example, I needed to choose between shorting US
dollar or Japanese yen (I repeated the process for choosing AUD or CAD).
Figure 1 below shows the 4-hour chart of both currencies for the past 10
days. It's evident from the chart that the US dollar is in a range and
the Japanese yen (actually it's JPY/USD) is moving up. 1 point goes to
US dollar trade. Next, I identify the strength of the support/resistance
to estimate in the case that the trade goes against me, which would have
better cushioning. It's a crude form of risk estimation. From the figure
below, see that the dollar has a clear resistance just below 76 and it
is currently stretched away from the cyan-coloured moving average.
Whereas the yen is near a recent top with no prior occurence and it has
been sitting above the moving average for a while. Another point for
dollar short. USD 2 : JPY 0. Consequently, I went long AUD/USD this
morning instead of AUD/JPY. This is by no means a vigorous methodology.
I'm not saying that shorting US dollar is a good idea from this
simplistic comparative process. It's just that my setup tells me to go
long AUD/USD or AUD/JPY, this is just a quick and easy way to help me
decide which trade to take. Nothing more. As an aside, some people may
prefer to use currency ETF, UUP and FXY, instead. But I don't like to
use ETF as a data source as the price is noisier because they are
affected by other factors.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>October is the first full month in which I traded forex. Naturally, this
is the first of my monthly trading performance review. Note that all the
trades were on a demo account with imaginary money only. But I still
took this seriously. My goal is to double this demo account starting
from CAD\$5000. Once that is accomplished, I will start live trading
with real money. Who knows how long this might take. Hopefully by then,
I will have a respectable set of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setups</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">strategies</a>, and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools">quant tools</a> developed. Anyway, let's get on with the monthly review.
As this is only my first month trading currencies after spending 8 years
in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/stocks/">stocks</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures</a>, my trading this month is marked by a lot
of experimentation. As can be seen in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trading log</a>, I performed
abysmally for the first couple of weeks. The last of my bad string ended
when I took an uncalled for trade <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-undisciplined-trade-shorted-eurusd-1-499-stopped-1-505-62-pips/">based on what I thought rather than
what I saw</a>. Not all is lost this month as I managed to write out the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">first of my forex trading setups</a> from the trials and errors. Since
then, I had a string of winners to push my monthly tally deeper into the
positive. While this is definitely good, I am cautious and doubtful to
my initial success because I am just at the right place, at the right
time. Because we might very well be witnessing the printing of the top
from this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/inter-market-analysis-after-a-new-2009-high-in-the-equity-market/">epic V-shaped rally since March</a>. The moves in the markets
were very strong and very rapid this last week. I just happen to be on
the right side of the trades.</p>
<h2>Performance Statistics Review</h2>
<p>In any case, I'll get down to business with discussing the performance
statistics below. On first sight, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio">Sharpe ratio</a> at 5.25 is
impressive for this month. However, looking a few lines below, see that
if we account for only the middle 90th percentile profits and losses,
the net profit is reduced by a magnitude. (So as to see what would
happen if we truncate the biggest (un)lucky wins and losses.) That means
much of my profit for this month was because of a few big trade. In
fact, it was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-eurjpy-135-00-500-1-pips/">this lucky trade when I made +500 pips</a> in one week.</p>
<h2>Goal for Next Month</h2>
<p>What I've learned from analyzing these numbers is that I lack
consistency (like all new traders), and was perhaps just lucky. So the
goals for the coming months are simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>achieve consistency by bringing up this mid 90% net profit value;
    and</li>
<li>maintain good Sharpe ratio rating by improving my risk management
    techniques.</li>
</ol>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I paid a price last week in trading EURCHF for not knowing the
fundamental analysis about the currency pair. First of all, here's how
my trade played out. The support between 1.500 and 1.510 is apparent if
you look at Figure 1. So I went long as shown in Figure 2 (second blue
triangle from right) based on a positive divergence at a strong support
of 1.510. EURCHF stayed range bound for a over a day while my other
positions were having roller coaster rides. That's when I decided to
tighten up my stop on my EURCHF long from 1.508 to 1.5095 to limit my
risk exposure. As you can see in Figure 2, that was a bad decision. On
October 30, EURCHF made a swing downward to take out the nearby stops
and then launched upward right past my target. That would have been a
quick and low risk play if I hadn't micro-manged the trade and moved my
stop up while the daily setup was still sound. While getting stopped out
is part of the game, as there is never absolute certainty in a trade.
But in this case, the probability of this up move was substantially
greater than I would have guessed. The extra bit of information lies
outside of the chart. It seems that there is a well known secret that
the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been intervening in the market to keep
the Swiss Franc from being even more overvalued. In particular, it's
well known that the SNB has their eyes on the 1.50 and 1.51 levels in
the EURCHF pair. SNB publicly announced their intention to intervene on
March 12. Immediately following the news, the EURCHF pair exploded up
470 pips in 20 minutes that day. If you look at Figure 1, you can see
that gigantic bar on March 12. The DailyFX has an article on this
<a href="http://www.dailyfx.com/story/bio1/Swiss_Franc_Plunges_After_SNB_1236870114798.html">monumental event</a>. Since then, the SNB has been coming to the rescue
of EURCHF in very obvious ways as shown in Figure 1 with the regular
spikes in prices. Prior to this October 30 move, EURCHF had an identical
price action exactly a month before on September 29, as shown in Figure
3. Back then, EURCHF also had a positive divergence on a test of support
at 1.5080. Then next thing you know, the pair popped over a 100 pips.
Obviously, the SNB is trying hard to paint the tape on the monthly chart
of EURCHF. As I was saying, the SNB is intervening in the market to keep
their currency from further over-valuation, which is hurting their local
economy. In both cases of Sept 29 and Oct 30, if the support was broken,
EURCHF would have stepped into a grave on the chart. Just look at that
huge vacuum below 1.50 on Figure 1. In this recent case on Oct 30, even
though I did go long because of the chart, I didn't have the edge of
knowing this information. Which led me missing this easy ride because I
didn't have as much conviction in this trade as I should have.
Coincidentally, as I have been aggravating to improve the win rates of
my trades, this came hitting me right on the head. So while I'm no
economist, I should at least be aware of the fundamental forces at play
in the currencies that I trade. At the end of the day, technical
analysis may provide guidelines to the mass psychology behind price
actions, but it is the fundamental and economic forces that are
ultimately driving the market. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"
