<p>The market broke my intraday support line today (pink line, first
graph). What appeared to be a good Monday turned out to be very
disappointing. I cleared the last of my short puts (i.e. long) about 5
seconds before the close when the market gained some footing. These
plays are purely for risk management purposes, each individual stock
looks ok to me to be accumulating at this level. But I'm in for the
swing trade and it haven't worked out. So I'm selling them all mainly
because the overall market looks weak.</p>
<p>To illustrate, today's intraday market data looked particularly bad. I
thought the market would turnaround after the TICK retested a -1200 low
for the day at noon on lower price, but the price continued to drift
down afterward. Then the 2pm rally didn't even break 930 (resistance
from yesterday) too. That was the last draw for me and I decided to exit
all risky positions from then on to minimize my risk. So I covered all
my options into the close.</p>
<p>The first of which was Dec SLW 5 put at 15:48 for \$1.70, which I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-3-slw-100-dec-08-5-put-155/">bought at \$1.55</a>. I still have my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-166-slw882-limit/">166 shares of SLW</a>, so it's an
obvious choice for me to unload the options. I don't want to be too
heavy on precious metal for now. SLW is still holding the \$3.4 level
and marked a higher low in the afternoon. So it's actually looking good.</p>

<p>Next I sold FRO at 15:59:27. The low of today looks like a test of a
daily trendline, pink line below on the right daily graph (Update: I
forgot to attach the graph. I added it a day later below). I normally
would have only sold if it breaks it, but again, the market looks bad.
So a retest of \$30 (highest volume in recent months) seems possible. I
covered the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fro-100-nov-08-40-put-790/">FRO short puts bought at \$7.90</a> for \$8.00. On another
note, I mistakenly placed a sell order on the put rather than a buy (to
cover) at \$8.10. So I quickly covered that accidental trade at \$8.30
regardless of that fact that FRO was moving up at that time. I've
learned my lesson in accidental orders and would cover immediately
regardless. I won't try to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-58-caf-2889-limit/">convince myself like my CAF trade</a>.</p>

<p>I covered my Nov <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-wfc-100-nov-08-31-put-360/">WFC short put bought at \$3.60</a> for \$3.00 at
15:59:55. Fee \$7.50.</p>
<p>I almost didn't want to give up my WFC position. It was the strongest
and the one most profitable of my Friday's swing trades. In particular,
last Friday's turnaround has by far the most volume in several months.
The \$28.0 support looks almost impenetrable. Indeed, today's low of
\$28.04 looks safe and we only tested it at very low volume. Indeed, I
really don't think we'll see this low again in the short term. Looking
at this more carefully now, maybe I should leave it open ... Oh well, I
can always get back in.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The major reoccurring problem I have in trading is not being objective
enough in my decision. A recent example is entering the market just
before the October crash and held on to the shares even <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/didnt-cut-losses-as-planned-and-now-paying-dearly/">when I doubted
my positions</a>. On the other hand, for the times when I executed a
trade as planned, I showed remarkable ability to make <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-of-the-day-bailed-out-of-a-wrong-position/">sound decisions
on the fly even under strenuous conditions</a>. Thus, it is in my best
interest to perform consistently and learn to be objective in my market
analysis.</p>
<p>I have come up with two solutions for my problem. 1) Make more use of
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">computational tools</a> and 2) improve my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-psychology/">trading psychology</a>.</p>
<p>In this particular post, I'd like to address my psychological barriers.
Coincidentally, a book I've been reading about conflict resolution
(Stone, et. al., "<em>Difficult Conversations</em>," pg 38+) has suggested
techniques that I think can be applied for trading.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, we argue with other people because of
difference of opinions. Similarly, we lose money in the market because
we are <em>arguing</em> with the market. The first step in conflict resolution
is understanding ourselves.</p>
<p>As best as we might try to remove emotion in our trading decision, the
tendency to develop unconsciously biased perception is very human. Our
perception about a situation is based on</p>
<ol>
<li>our selection of information</li>
<li>our interpretation</li>
<li>our conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>Some people use candlestick charts, some uses line graphs. A bullish
crossover on the RSI can mean a turn of sentiment to some or imminent
opportunity to short for others. These are just some examples of how we
add our personal touch to each problem. Indeed, I don't think
eliminating emotion from the equation is advisable. It is our
experience, our knowledge, and our skills that we should rely on to make
tough decisions. Since decisions happen so fast and generally involve
more subconscious than not, we are not aware of all the influences of
our views.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
One way to keep an unbiased opinion is to thoroughly understand how you
came to a conclusion. Why did we select one information over the other?
What assumptions are we making in an interpretation? How did we come up
with a conclusion based on our interpretations? In other words, shift
from a certain stance about our conclusion to a curious state about the
entire thinking process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One way to shift your stance from the easy certainty of feeling that
you've thought about this from every possible angle is to get curious
about what you don't know about yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping an open mind with a curious approach can help you evaluate
wether your views make sense in light of new information and
perspective.</p>
<p></p>
For example, the way I analyze a potential <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/entry/">trade entry</a> is to think
from both sides of the trade (go long or go short). Ultimately, I enter
the trade as planned if my analysis is stronger than the
counter-arguments.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>While I haven't written about my stance on the flood of bailouts, I have
been against it all along. Pouring tax payers' <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122540927284586151.html">money into a select few
elites</a> in the name of <em>helping</em> the economy has sank my respect for
the American government to a new low. This is just like the Bush's
Weapons of Mass Destruction lies and the subsequent Iraq invasion all
over again, only on an epic scale and the effect much more encompassing.
However, the situation have reached a new low. In today's news, there's
talk of banks asking for credit card debt forgiveness. They might as
well just hand out each American a million dollar cheque. Then watch the
American dollar become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar">Zimbobwe money</a> and plunge America back to the
Medieval era when people would barter for their goods. The sheer
stupidity of this move is below even that of Bush's intelligence! If
what the U.S.A. is doing lately isn't socialism, then I don't know what
is. That is one huge factor why I've been long gold and silver with my
accumulating position in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">SLW</a>. It looks as though we might be in for
a continued downtrend in precious metal prices. But sooner or later,
prices will reflect their true values. Update: The Big Picture made a
post about <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/10/moral-hazard-of.html">mortgage bailouts</a> today on the same issue. Barry puts the
issue of bailing out bad debts succinctly, "moral hazard not only
encourages recklessness, it leads to people looking to avoid
responsibility for bad decisions."</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>While the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122518913601675675.html">market is sorting things out today</a>, I'd like to document a
simple stock price predictor based on put/call activity called Option
Pain or Max Pain.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that professional traders favour writing options.
Since trading options is a zero-sum game, it is in their best interest
if a majority of options expire worthless on expiration day.</p>
<p>By observing the open interest of a stock at each strike price, we can
see at what price the Option Pain would occur. Of course, this is just
another tool for the trader to use, so do your own due diligence as
usual when trading.</p>

<p>Using this chart from <a href="http://www.optionpain.com/MaxPain/Max-Pain.php">Option Pain</a>, we can see that the minimum
option total value of November SLW is at \$5. So our max pain price is
at \$5 for November's SLW. That is to say, if SLW settles at \$5, then
the most call option would expire worthless and most of the put option
would expire worthless. Such that the option sellers (the pros) can
pocket your money.</p>
<p>Another way to use this information is to find the best Max Pain to
Current Price ratio among a list of stocks. For example, SLW closed at
\$2.59 yesterday. Its max pain is \$5 from the chart above. That is
almost a double. Note, however, that we haven't figured out the
probability of SLW reaching \$5. This would be something for me to look
into.</p>
<p>In comparison, GOOG's max pain for November is at \$360. Its previous
closing price is 329.49. Based on these numbers, SLW is a better buy
than GOOG for now.</p>
