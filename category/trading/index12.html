<hr />
<p>I'm using the intra-day ATR as a risk factor because I'm assuming them
as noise. I use 10 min. as the basis because that's about the time
period I use. The reward is the max daily swing, which is the daily ATR.</p>
<p></p>
As you can see, the reward/risk is about the same for all the liquid
index futures. However, I'm leaning toward YM because of the smaller
contract size and it seems more stable lately. I'll watch the markets
closely from now on.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Read this from a commenter on BillCara. I am posting it here for record
for later analysis.</p>
<div id="c43346">
</p>
Stu: If I may..dont guess the market direction.!!

Just trade with the trend between support and resistance zones. Let the
market tell you direction...dont guess...trade with a 'no mind' (thats
from the last samurai movie):).

i.e.e dont think too much, think when you are doing your homework at
night or pre-market, not during trading.

Try This. On your monitor...put up 3 charts. 1) \$SPX 2) Breadth chart
like \$ NYAD or \$NYSE advancing issues, add a 10period moving ave on a
3 or 5 min chart. 3) The chart of what you are trading, I guess the XLF.

Before market moving events. take the \$SPX chart ..start with the
weekly time frame . Draw all key resistance and support zones. the
nearest resistance zone today was around \$spx 1385ish.

Go to your dailies..nearest resistance..1380ish, go to a 5 day 5 minute
chart, and draw a line connecting the two most prominent pivot lows.
Hopefully the line extends as you trade, dont know your platform. That
tells you resistance 1380ish, support 1350ish. No worries with market
direction, or size of rate cut.

Now you know 2 potential reversal points. now trade within it by
following the trend of the rbeadth chart.if the breadth is trading above
the 10moving average..go long. if below go short.

if the 10 moving average is flat on the breadth chart..stay out..its
likely to be a congestion zone.low reward to risk.

FOMC announces...irrelevant..market direction matters ..follow your
market breadth chart. The first reaction..look at your breadth chart
dont look at prices. look at MARKET DIRECTION.

3 steps FOMC announcement..1)knee-jerk..2)counter knee jerk...then
3)trade direction . market trends up and reverses at \$SPX 1380
ish.which coincides with XLF reversal ( there is also a RSI bearish
divergence, AND a long red bar).sell your UYG, go long SKF.... 2 large
directional moves.

Now you have your lines markng \$SPX resistance, the trendline from the
last two lows, RSI bearish divergence on XLF and a red candlestick at
resistance on the \$SPX..confirming exit LONG.

Why isnt it just a pullback ?..the candlesticks stays below the 10EMA
with 2 long cascading long bars( as opposed to inisde bars) .Layer your
Short trades in.

Stay in the trend as long as it stays below the 10 moveing ave...add to
your position if any pullback does not cross the 10 move ave..

Sell at \$SPX support. I didnt..I got out at todays lows...

I have a few other ETFs..they follow \$SPX support n Resistance...XLF is
one of them.

P/s It helps if you use candlestick reversal patterns . which is showing
a reversal on the daily \$SPX..lets see what the market says tommorow.

<p>
Good luck ..this is a friendly tape for day traders...just stay out of
congestion zones.

workspace for scalping. The idea here is that often times, the price
would top/bottom at some points and then change direction momentarily
for a breather. This doesn't necessarily signal a trend reversal, but
more often a quick retracement of the price for a breather. So an exit
bracket should be used with Stop just outside of the top/btm and a
profit target based on the ATR.</p>
<p>The second condition used is a Fast Stochastic divergence. The third
condition is that the Stochastic has to be in OB or OS zone.</p>
<p>Update: This ShowMe is popping too many times in real-time. Because in
real-time, open = high = low when the bar opens. Then when the price
goes down, stochastic would go down too and so the ShowMe would go on.</p>

Maybe Stochastic between 85 and 50 for long.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy</a> to catch a turn in trend using
Stochastic, Commodity Channel Index (CCI), and Keltner Channel. Here's
the concept. Enter position on concurrent signals from the following
indicators. CCI (which marks a turn), Stochastic (in corresponding
overbought or oversold zone for confirmation), and Keltner channel
(relative position of the current price) signals. To avoid hunting for
tops or bottoms in a strong move, do not enter if the current trend is
obviously opposite of the entry position. That can probably be filtered
by a 2-ema technique, MACD, or by analyzing a higher time frame. Below
are two example charts with all the indicators used illustrated along
with the entry signals. Blue dots for long entry, red for short. If you

<li>day traded YM again, ended up about \$55 for the day with 4 trades.</li>
<li>Stochastic slow crossing oversold/bought line seems to be a pretty
    good indicator. I combined it with CCI smoothed and look at the
    underlying trend to catch retracements.</li>
<li>worked a bit on the system again, but the market changes too much,
    difficult to make a catch-all system that can be consistent. I will
    continue trading manually to gain experience.</li>
<li>installed the eKam Hesitation indicator</li>
<li>Examined swing trading soybean. My system seems to work well there
    too. But risk/reward only = 10, daily range / intraday range.
    Whereas YM's risk/reward is 20. But YM is more choppy lately and S
    is swinging well.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Lesson:</span> Don't focus on

<li>Entered a short position of YM at \$897.10 with stop at \$902.6

<p>Yesterday I was day trading too. Up about \$100. I've been working on
the system for the past couple of days, disappointing results. On the

better method.</p> </div>
