<p>With VIX at a multi-year high and the current market turmoil, it seems
to be a good time to write about market volatility.</p>
<p>Market volatility is a two-edged sword. Day traders dream of catching
the 800 point swing in the YM contracts. Yet, most would lose more being
stopped out before giving up and then missing the swing. For long term
traders, these 800 point swing could cause panic (if you're on the wrong
side) or doubts (should you or should you not take the profit?).</p>
<p>Based on my brief experience in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/day-trading/">day trading</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures markets</a>,
I am not one to play with fire. For my longer term plays, I am <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/didnt-cut-losses-as-planned-and-now-paying-dearly/">feeling
the pain as we speak</a>. Thus, it is important to realize that although
market <em>volatility is very tempting for quick profits, greed never pays
in trading</em>. Another characteristic in a highly volatile market is that
there're a lot of emotions going on. As you know, emotions can cloud our
judgement. It's more difficult to trade when you're filled with panic,
fear, greed, excitement, etc.</p>
<p>In other words, market volatility is bad because 1) large swings both
ways at any time and 2) lots of emotions in the market and yourself.</p>
<p>To minimize your risk, it's better to minimize your exposure to the
market at times of high volatility. Thus, I use the rule that...</p>
<p><strong>If 50 dma of VIX > 20, then reduce position size to some % (i.e. 50%)
of usual amount.</strong></p>
<p>As a corollary, here's another interesting idea. It's widely known that
markets tend to creep up and plunge down, i.e. rising slow and steadily,
and fall quick and hard. Looking at the 50 dma VIX, it's actually a
quicker indicator for the 2007 top than my previous <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/back-to-basics-market-sentiment-via-2-line-ema-on-sp500/">2-line EMA
indicator for market sentiment</a>. Conceptually, if we accept that bull
market is slow and bear market is fast, then this idea of using VIX to
signal bull/bear sentiment do seem viable. However, there's already too
many IF's and assumptions for me to take this seriously. Therefore,
let's just stick with using volatility for managing position sizing
only.</p>

<p>One of the most, if not THE most, important theme in trading is
identifying if we're in a bull or bear market. It's easier to "ride with
the wave" than to fight against it. While there are an abundance of
work, studies, theories, or whatever, on calling out market sentiments,
I feel that the most useful way of doing it would be ones that stick to
the facts. And the only fact we can be certain of in the market is the
price.</p>
<p>So here's the idea (definitely not original) for <strong>guessing</strong> market
sentiment.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bull market = 50 dma > 200 dma for S&amp;P 500.</li>
<li>Bear market = 50 dma \&lt; 200 dma for S&amp;P 500.</li>
</ol>
<p>As with any indicator, this is not a law. It's just a signal to give you
a piece of information for you to <strong>intrepret</strong> based on the
fundamentals and maybe other technical analysis tools.</p>

<hr />
<p>I'm using the intra-day ATR as a risk factor because I'm assuming them
as noise. I use 10 min. as the basis because that's about the time
period I use. The reward is the max daily swing, which is the daily ATR.</p>
<p></p>
As you can see, the reward/risk is about the same for all the liquid
index futures. However, I'm leaning toward YM because of the smaller
contract size and it seems more stable lately. I'll watch the markets
closely from now on.</p> </div>

Stu: If I may..dont guess the market direction.!!

Just trade with the trend between support and resistance zones. Let the
market tell you direction...dont guess...trade with a 'no mind' (thats
from the last samurai movie):).

i.e.e dont think too much, think when you are doing your homework at
night or pre-market, not during trading.

Try This. On your monitor...put up 3 charts. 1) \$SPX 2) Breadth chart
like \$ NYAD or \$NYSE advancing issues, add a 10period moving ave on a
3 or 5 min chart. 3) The chart of what you are trading, I guess the XLF.

Before market moving events. take the \$SPX chart ..start with the
weekly time frame . Draw all key resistance and support zones. the
nearest resistance zone today was around \$spx 1385ish.

Go to your dailies..nearest resistance..1380ish, go to a 5 day 5 minute
chart, and draw a line connecting the two most prominent pivot lows.
Hopefully the line extends as you trade, dont know your platform. That
tells you resistance 1380ish, support 1350ish. No worries with market
direction, or size of rate cut.

Now you know 2 potential reversal points. now trade within it by
following the trend of the rbeadth chart.if the breadth is trading above
the 10moving average..go long. if below go short.

if the 10 moving average is flat on the breadth chart..stay out..its
likely to be a congestion zone.low reward to risk.

FOMC announces...irrelevant..market direction matters ..follow your
market breadth chart. The first reaction..look at your breadth chart
dont look at prices. look at MARKET DIRECTION.

3 steps FOMC announcement..1)knee-jerk..2)counter knee jerk...then
3)trade direction . market trends up and reverses at \$SPX 1380
ish.which coincides with XLF reversal ( there is also a RSI bearish
divergence, AND a long red bar).sell your UYG, go long SKF.... 2 large
directional moves.

Now you have your lines markng \$SPX resistance, the trendline from the
last two lows, RSI bearish divergence on XLF and a red candlestick at
resistance on the \$SPX..confirming exit LONG.

Why isnt it just a pullback ?..the candlesticks stays below the 10EMA
with 2 long cascading long bars( as opposed to inisde bars) .Layer your
Short trades in.

Stay in the trend as long as it stays below the 10 moveing ave...add to
your position if any pullback does not cross the 10 move ave..

Sell at \$SPX support. I didnt..I got out at todays lows...

I have a few other ETFs..they follow \$SPX support n Resistance...XLF is
one of them.

P/s It helps if you use candlestick reversal patterns . which is showing
a reversal on the daily \$SPX..lets see what the market says tommorow.

<p>
Good luck ..this is a friendly tape for day traders...just stay out of
congestion zones.
