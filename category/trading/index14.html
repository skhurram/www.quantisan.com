            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Once again, I find myself on the other side of the fence. I entered a
short at 10:42am today thinking the gap up is unsustainable. Well, not
only has S&amp;P500 broken 800, it's now resting above 820. Goldman Sachs
(GS) was about 106.50 when I entered the short. GS closed at 111.93
today. I'm down \$210 already. If GS can stay above this 200 day MA at
\$110 later tomorrow, then I'm out.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1125" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>As you can see, GS went vertical upward once it broke the morning
resistance at \$17.30. The reason for my entry in the morning was
because GS seemed like it was having difficulty breaking \$17.
Furthermore, S&amp;P 500 also seemed hesitant around 800. So I guessed it'd
be reasonable to see a pullback.</p>
<p>However, I failed to take into account today's humongous gap up open. It
would have been counter-productive if we're to close the gap on the
weekend's hype up. This is pretty much a reverse of what we've seen
seeing for the past few months. Panic begets panic. But in today's case,
it's panic of missing the rally train that'll fuel this possibly new leg
of a rally.</p>
<p>My second mistake is trading on lack of information. I traded using the
mobile platform and by just looking at the Google Finance charts. If I
had access to my intraday sentiment chart, I could have easily seen that
the morning momentum remained strong even when S&amp;P was stalling around
800.</p>
<p>Lastly, I really should stick to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/market%20analysis/">my own analysis</a> and not trade on a
spontaneous urge. I did say in the morning that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/beginning-of-another-bull-phase-asian-markets-are-on-fire/">we'll break down if we
fail to maintain 800</a>. Even at the time of my short entry, we were
indeed holding on to the 800 zone. Thus, I have basically shot myself in
the foot for not listening to myself.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>To bail. Not to bail. To bail. Not to bail. Friday's market gapped down
big time on news the bailout failed to pass the senate on Thursday
night. Then just hours later, rumours were surfacing about the White
House stepping in with the TARP money. As of Saturday, FP headline reads
White House holds off on auto bailout.</p>
<p>Since I'm no economist, I am not going to discuss about the auto bailout
here. What matters to me is the market. As I was saying, the market
gapped down Friday morning and even touched 851 in the first few
minutes. However, it hacked its way back up to close positive at 879.73.</p>
<p>We managed to hold this critical 850 support level as I noted in
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/post-market-analysis-december-11-2008/">Thursday's post-market analysis</a>. However, I wouldn't want to add to
the longs at this point because both of my uptrend channels have been
broken. I feel that at this point, it is safer to watch and be more late
into a trend than usual.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to see the S&amp;P 500's behaviour around 860 or
900 (Figure 2), which ever comes first, before adding to my existing
positions.</p>

<p>On a more personal note, my stops for DRYS and SKF were triggered on
Friday.</p>
<p>On December 12, 2008 8:30:32 AM, my -\$1.0 trailing stop for DRYS were
triggered (stop at \$7.90) and my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-200-drys-533/">last 100 shares</a> were sold for a
basement price of \$7.34. I have definitely been a victim by the market
makers gunning for stops. As DRYS pushed higher throughout the day and
closed at \$9.37 on Friday.</p>
<p>As I'm actually away on a trip for these few weeks, I don't think I'll
re-enter DRYS until it clears the resistance at \$12. I simply cannot
watch it as close as I would like.</p>
<p>In any case, I already unloaded half my position <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-drys-111103/">previously at
\$11.11</a>. So although I feel I've been ripped off with my stop, I
believe this is overall still a good trade because I unloaded on
strength and have set a reasonable (using my channel) stop just in case
it turns back down on me while I'm away.</p>

<p>My Ultrashort Financials (SKF) stop was triggered on Friday too. This
one I am a little dumbfounded. I have set my trailing stop at -\$17 on
the mark for SKF. The stop price of \$124 was triggered and my 7 shares
were sold for \$124.09. Having <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-7-skf-12883/">bought at \$128.83 the previous day</a>,
this is a small loss.</p>
<p>Notice that giant opening spike in the chart below? This is yet another
example of the market makers gunning for the stops. I believe I should
have set a hard stop instead for this one since I'm using it as a hedge.</p>

<p>This is still a trader's market. Since I'm away oversea, I can't manage
my account as effective as I would have liked. Setting the trailing
stops was a safety measure. Although they worked against me this time, I
still think it was a good decision given my circumstances.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am at 50% longs now with no hedge (not good). My other 50% is
in cash. My primary short term goal now is to seek out a good short
entry to hedge my longs. I don't think I have the guts to add anymore
longs until I see more strength in this rally.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been trying to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/?s=bottom">catch falling knives</a> for a few weeks now.
Every time I think we're at a bottom, the market rally a bit to get my
hopes up and then continue to drift down more. In retrospect, there are
so many trading no-no's I have broken with that dangerous mentality. My
account is down significantly as of this writing and I have learned many
old and new lessons throughout these weeks. In fact, I have demonstrated
improving trading <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">technique</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1190/">psychology</a> even as I was losing
money overall (what an oxymoron). Rather I'm trying to comfort myself or
not, the fact is that losing money is simply unacceptable in trading. So
I will review these trades in this post and perhaps learn something from
them.</p>
<p>As the title suggest, this is a post for post-hoc analysis of the
options which I held into expiry (3 losing and 1 winning). I'll do this
chronologically. The longest Nov09 position I have is SLW Nov 2.5 Call.
I have been a big fan of SLW as I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written and traded SLW numerous
times</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, I've annoted my charts
more than usual and will show more and write less in this post. I noted
my entry point in each trade, and labelled the stop and post-hoc <strong>ideal
exit/stop points</strong>.</p>

<p>My effective <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">entry point in my SLW Nov 2.5 Calls</a> were at SLW share
price of \$2.90 (SLW closed at \$2.81 Friday). I bought 2 Calls for
\$0.55 and at expiry, they are worth \$0.325. A loss of \$45 + \$15 for
commission as of this writing. I held on to my 2.5 calls and exercised
them, so +200 shares of SLW for me.</p>
<p>Next up is ABB on the same day. The share price for ABB was at \$10.31
when I entered. ABB closed Friday at \$9.95. I bougt the three ABB Nov
10 Calls for \$0.90. They are worth \$0.05 each. A total loss of \$255 +
\$15 for commission.</p>

<p>Then we have TCK entered at TCK share price of \$5.575. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-tck-100-nov-08-5-call-100/">bought two
TCK Nov 5 Calls for \$1.00</a> each and they are now worthless. A
complete wipeout of \$200 + \$15 commission.</p>

<p>Lastly, there's this puny winning day trade in the last 40 minute of
Friday. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/">bought a UYG Nov 3 Call for \$0.55</a> and it expired for
\$0.95. A profit of \$40 - \$15 comission, so a total of +\$25 so far. I
held on to this call and exercised it. I have +100 shares of UYG to
carry over the weekend.</p>

<p>As you can see, <strong>if only I have used trailing stops, I could have held
onto some of the profits and not turn winning trades into a losing
ones</strong>. I didn't want to let the large swing in premiums stop me out
from a big rally. That's why I didn't use trailing stop. However, the
lack of subsequent follow-through and confirmation in the rally should
have been a glaring alarm sign. I should have put in trailing stops from
this lack of strength in the rally. <strong>Any counter-trend position should
be carefully managed with tighter than usual risk management</strong>.</p>
<p>I have let my <em>undying hope for a rally</em> clouded my judgement. This
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/move-from-certainty-to-curiosity-to-improve-your-trading/">stubborn need to be right</a> is a very fundamental psychological flaw
in trading. If I can't stop doing that in the future, I might as well
quit trading manually and focus on developing my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative financial
engineering</a> work. However, as I have noted, I think I'm improving
lately and upon further reflection, I believe I have come up with a
potential methodology to correct myself in the act ... More on this as I
develop on this technique.</p>

<p>Finally! I have been waiting for a bear market rally for weeks! I
decided to go <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">full long after the bounce from 820 today</a>. Refer to
that post for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">details of my entries</a>. In this post, I would like to discuss why the 820 bounce
gave me the confidence in going all in despite widespread fear and the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/covered-slw-fro-and-wfc-short-puts/">many failed attempts</a> myself.</p>
<p>A quick recap of the past week's action. After the failed rally attempt
from 10/28 to 11/04, the market has been brutal to say the least. Any
strength failed to stir enthusiasm and has bled down slowly. The market
drifted down lower on little volume day after day. If I were to describe
the market, I'd say it looked like the last moment of a dying man. This
lack of will to move has certainly killed many bulls. I was one of them.
I have been stopped out a few times trying to catch this falling knife
(more like a grind). I even prepared to exit the last of my holdings if
we do break down from this point.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the day, the market looked like it's going to be
another down drift today. But being very near the 10/10 bottom already,
I know things are going to move one way or the other before the options
expiry next week. And since the Max Pain for the index options are at
least 10% higher, I am still looking for a reversal soon.</p>
<p>I mentally noted S&amp;P at 845 is an important level. It was the low of the
10/28 big rally day. The market skid on the 845 level all morning with
little volume. That was good because it is testing a support on low
volume. I had thought we may bounce from there.</p>
<p>Then I went to lunch just before noon.</p>
<p>When I got back after 1pm, the market has already broken down. However,
there are several bullish indication I noticed.</p>
<ol>
<li>the break down volume is higher than the previous bar (Figure 1),
    but it's still relatively low. Which means we don't have panic
    selling yet.</li>
<li>both the TICK and Advance-Decline line moving averages (Figure 2)
    are relatively healthy for such an important drop. Indicating no
    broad selling.</li>
<li>notice the unusual V shape for the TICK (Figure 2)? We even reached
    a new multi-day low of -1666. Yet #1 and #2 contradicts this
    seemingly panic selling, so this depression in price looked
    artificial to me</li>
</ol>
<p>Like how the recent rally attempts lacked enthusiasm, this break of 845
and test of 820 looked like it lacked enthusiasm too. Given that this is
such a major support level, odds are that we will bounce from here at
least for intraday. That is when I made my entry.</p>
<p></p>
Before 2pm, we broke 850, the low of yesterday, with the highest 30 min
volume of the week. That is when the rally looked strong to me and my
doubt of a bull trap eased. Frankly, I had some tight mental stops and
prepared to jump if things deteriorate like the many times before.</p>
<p>The day continued strong with price and volume confirmation. We closed
at the high with significant volume. We even reached 700 million volume
on SPY, a first since 10/16. I believe an intermediate bottom has been
set so I'll be looking at a longer timeframe (days) for my long
positions now.</p>
<p>First expected resistance from this move is 980 on the S&amp;P from the
trendline (Figure 1, right). Target is at least the 50 dma, we just
haven't touched it for 2 months. This is as good a time as ever to give
it a run for it.</p>
<p>Today is a great example of the need for critical thinking with a clear
head in light of a lot of pressure and past emotion. The beaten account,
the grim market movement, and the many stopped out trades has nearly
made me walk away for the week. But I remained focus on the market and
made my decision based on the price action.</p>
<p>Despite renewed optimism, I will continue to practice <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">prudent risk
management</a> and to eventually pocket at least most of the profit from
today, if not more.</p>
