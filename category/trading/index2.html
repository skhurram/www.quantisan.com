            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market took a big bite out of me this week just as when I am not
giving it its fullest attention. I took a short-side trade in Manulife
Financial (MFC.TO) last Thursday simply <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-11jan-put-14-00-0-93-mark-13-97/">because of a price pattern</a>.
I did not seek to confirm my hypothesis with short-term price action and
intermarket analysis like I usually would because I've been so consumed
with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">setting up my trading system on the cloud</a>. I became careless
because of my recent win streak and my involvement in so many matters. I
lost my focus. My short in Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) is deep in red as
of this writing. The market gapped above my stop loss price over the
weekend and never eased back for me to exit at my stop as planned. I've
placed in a limit order to target a retracement to \$14.50 because
there's not much left to recuperate if I dump my position now. MFC.TO is
well above \$15, so I am prepared for the worst. Judging by the volume,
this looks like a valid breakout too. At least my put options don't
expire until January. If my puts expire, this will be a loss of \$372 +
\$9.90 commission = \$381.90 = 3.9% of my RRSP account. To put this into
perspective, according to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>, this may become my biggest
single loss in a trade in this account. Three folds greater than my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/boughtsold-250-tck-b-to-34-1033-68-loss-1-2/">previous biggest loser at 1.23%</a>. Ouch!</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Manulife
Financial (MFC.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-11-08-MFC.TO.png" />][][/caption] Manulife is only half of my
blunder this week. The real killer is in Ventana Gold (VEN.TO). As you
may recall, I have been very bullish on VEN.TO. In fact, I've been
stalking this gem for months by <a href="../tag/ven.to/">nibbling on small bullish positions</a>
to test the water now and then. Just as when I dug myself into a hole
because of this extended loss, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-didnt-miss-a-boat-i-missed-a-freakin-rocket/">VEN.TO launched off on a rocket</a> (Fig.
2). I am just staring at its takeoff outside the fence without the
ability to take a position because of my self-regulated risk exposure
limit. There goes a few weeks of research and analysis out the window.
Double ouch! [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

trading can be, at least I am adament with my risk management and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-reasons-why-i-even-bother-trading-a-small-account/">traded within my limits</a>. A 3.9% loss in a trade is horrible, but
it's not catastrophic. I will survive this one, redo my research, regain
my focus, and be able to fight on another day. This is what trading is
about.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If you look closely at my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>, you will see that the amount
that I trade is small. I am not going to get rich anytime soon even if I
can maintain my 10% return or so every half a year. My wife was asking
me the other day why I don't plunk in more money to my trading accounts
since I have even <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">won a trading contest</a> and all. With accounts and
trading sizes so small, I am appearing to be just wasting my time. For
example, it took 2 to 3 hours of research and analysis the night before
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-300-ven-to-8-95-stop-8-80/">this recent trade in gold</a> and then just to see it make \$35. At
least it's slightly better than the minimum wage here. The real trial
though, is in facing a losing streak. Imagine spending hours and hours
pouring over price charts, economic news, and financial data only to see
your account shrink and shrink. Those are the times when you wonder why
you even bother putting in the hours. It just won't make a difference,
right? Well, here are my three motivations for trading a small account.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slow and steady.</strong> The fact is, trading is about aiming for
    consistency and not scoring that one-in-a-lifetime trade that'll
    make you rich. That took me a few years to realize. It is <em>a lot
    easier</em> to make pocket change than score a jackpot. Don't make
    trading harder on yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Trading comfortably.</strong> Hey, this is a hobby. I wouldn't last too
    long in this game if I'm sweating my palms with every position. If I
    bet my farm often, either my account will go broke or my sanity
    will. I prefer to keep my risk small enough to lasts and make
    trading <em>enjoyable</em>. If I want thrills, I go to a casino (there is
    actually a big casino 15 min. from my house).</li>
<li><strong>Walk before you run.</strong> Eventually though, as I become consistently
    profitable, I increase my risk ever so slightly step by step. Couple
    that with the effect of compounding, I may eventually be able to
    replace my salary with my trading income. That is probably still
    years away for me, but as people say, everybody has to start
    somewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>So no, I don't think trading a small size is a waste of my time. It is a
good <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">risk management, psychological mediation, and learning
technique</a> for amateur traders such as myself.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Markets hitched a one-way train in the third quarter. TSX opened in July
at 11200. It closed September at 12368. A whopping 10% jump in three
months! S&amp;P500 made a similarly impressive 9.7% jump. We simply don't
get 10% moves even in most <em>years</em>. I made fewer trades this quarter but
held each one for longer to ride the trend. However, I am not as
successful as I'd hope. In particular, my worst trade this quarter was
in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/ven.to/">Ventana Gold</a> (VEN.TO). The position <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-350-ven-to-10-50-profit-0-8-re-bought-250-ven-to-10-67/">was profitable</a>, but the
money made was only a quarter as what I should have made. I was too
aggressive to go long when <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-400-ven-to-10-70-breakeven/">VEN.TO was heading into a brick wall</a>.
Ironically, my best trade this quarter was one that didn't make money.
In hindsight, I was wrong in the direction of a position but managed to
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-4-mfc-11jan-puts-14-00-1-74-mark-12-96-loss-0-1/">escape with just a scratch</a>. If I had been stubborn in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-jan-2010-puts-14-00-1-70-mark-13-25/">this failed
Manulife short</a>, my profit this quarter would have been wiped out. It
was a close call (technically, it was a put contract). It looks as
though I did <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-whole-year-two-hundred-and-six-posts-later/">learn something in the past year</a>. My main focus this
quarter has been the backend of my trading work. Namely in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative
finance study and development</a>. My automated strategy performed well
in the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> JForex contest. I won sixth place in July and first
place in August. My win streak (I also won in April) garnered the
attention from the people at Dukascopy and they kindly invited me to the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">Geneva Forex Event for a TV interview</a>. By far the most impressive
thing that happened to me this quarter was <a href="../pictures-from-geneva/">this trip to Geneva</a>.
<strong>Quarterly Metric Q3 Q2</strong> Sarting Fund \$9,404.87 \$8,000.00 End of
Quarter Fund \$9,630.75 \$9,404.87 Total Net Profit \$225.88 \$1,404.87

this in the last quarter, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/june-and-second-quarter-2010-trading-review/">commissions are the bane of my trading</a>.
Last quarter it took away 11% of my total return. This time it's 54%!
The structure of my equities commission requires that I trade less but
punch hard. This isn't my style. My intention is to trade less by being
more picky in my RRSP trading account. The 0.85% max. drawdown this
quarter is impressive though. I sometimes lose more than that in a
single position. Sterling Ratio 0.22 1.44 Excess Return 2.29% 17.46%
SDev Return per Trade 1.01% 2.21% Kurtosis 1.89 -0.93 Skewness 1.65 0.72
Despite my modest 2.4% return this quarter, it's not a good number in
light of the market liftoff. My low <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/">modified Sterling Ratio</a> says so.
On the other hand, the statistics from my trades improved. I achieved
consistency by lowering the standard deviation of my trades and skewed
my trade returns more to the positive. Yet another thing to caution is
my high kurtosis value. Which means my total returns are due to big
profits from a couple of trades. Other than these, there is not much to
add about the rest of the data. 95th Percentile P&amp;L \$193.49 \$421.15

<h2>Goal for the Fourth Quarter</h2>
<p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/june-and-second-quarter-2010-trading-review/">goal from the previous quarter</a> is to learn and build my first indicator in JForex. I achieved
that just this week. However, I plan to change direction in my work by
using less JForex and using more custom tools. My goal for the next
quarter is to learn R programming and
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">implement a JForex to R
data exchange system</span> (done, good old CSV files).</p>
