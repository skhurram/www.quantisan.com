            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If you look closely at my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>, you will see that the amount
that I trade is small. I am not going to get rich anytime soon even if I
can maintain my 10% return or so every half a year. My wife was asking
me the other day why I don't plunk in more money to my trading accounts
since I have even <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">won a trading contest</a> and all. With accounts and
trading sizes so small, I am appearing to be just wasting my time. For
example, it took 2 to 3 hours of research and analysis the night before
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-300-ven-to-8-95-stop-8-80/">this recent trade in gold</a> and then just to see it make \$35. At
least it's slightly better than the minimum wage here. The real trial
though, is in facing a losing streak. Imagine spending hours and hours
pouring over price charts, economic news, and financial data only to see
your account shrink and shrink. Those are the times when you wonder why
you even bother putting in the hours. It just won't make a difference,
right? Well, here are my three motivations for trading a small account.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slow and steady.</strong> The fact is, trading is about aiming for
    consistency and not scoring that one-in-a-lifetime trade that'll
    make you rich. That took me a few years to realize. It is <em>a lot
    easier</em> to make pocket change than score a jackpot. Don't make
    trading harder on yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Trading comfortably.</strong> Hey, this is a hobby. I wouldn't last too
    long in this game if I'm sweating my palms with every position. If I
    bet my farm often, either my account will go broke or my sanity
    will. I prefer to keep my risk small enough to lasts and make
    trading <em>enjoyable</em>. If I want thrills, I go to a casino (there is
    actually a big casino 15 min. from my house).</li>
<li><strong>Walk before you run.</strong> Eventually though, as I become consistently
    profitable, I increase my risk ever so slightly step by step. Couple
    that with the effect of compounding, I may eventually be able to
    replace my salary with my trading income. That is probably still
    years away for me, but as people say, everybody has to start
    somewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>So no, I don't think trading a small size is a waste of my time. It is a
good <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">risk management, psychological mediation, and learning
technique</a> for amateur traders such as myself.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Markets hitched a one-way train in the third quarter. TSX opened in July
at 11200. It closed September at 12368. A whopping 10% jump in three
months! S&amp;P500 made a similarly impressive 9.7% jump. We simply don't
get 10% moves even in most <em>years</em>. I made fewer trades this quarter but
held each one for longer to ride the trend. However, I am not as
successful as I'd hope. In particular, my worst trade this quarter was
in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/ven.to/">Ventana Gold</a> (VEN.TO). The position <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-350-ven-to-10-50-profit-0-8-re-bought-250-ven-to-10-67/">was profitable</a>, but the
money made was only a quarter as what I should have made. I was too
aggressive to go long when <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-400-ven-to-10-70-breakeven/">VEN.TO was heading into a brick wall</a>.
Ironically, my best trade this quarter was one that didn't make money.
In hindsight, I was wrong in the direction of a position but managed to
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-4-mfc-11jan-puts-14-00-1-74-mark-12-96-loss-0-1/">escape with just a scratch</a>. If I had been stubborn in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-jan-2010-puts-14-00-1-70-mark-13-25/">this failed
Manulife short</a>, my profit this quarter would have been wiped out. It
was a close call (technically, it was a put contract). It looks as
though I did <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-whole-year-two-hundred-and-six-posts-later/">learn something in the past year</a>. My main focus this
quarter has been the backend of my trading work. Namely in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative
finance study and development</a>. My automated strategy performed well
in the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> JForex contest. I won sixth place in July and first
place in August. My win streak (I also won in April) garnered the
attention from the people at Dukascopy and they kindly invited me to the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">Geneva Forex Event for a TV interview</a>. By far the most impressive
thing that happened to me this quarter was <a href="../pictures-from-geneva/">this trip to Geneva</a>.
<strong>Quarterly Metric Q3 Q2</strong> Sarting Fund \$9,404.87 \$8,000.00 End of
Quarter Fund \$9,630.75 \$9,404.87 Total Net Profit \$225.88 \$1,404.87

this in the last quarter, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/june-and-second-quarter-2010-trading-review/">commissions are the bane of my trading</a>.
Last quarter it took away 11% of my total return. This time it's 54%!
The structure of my equities commission requires that I trade less but
punch hard. This isn't my style. My intention is to trade less by being
more picky in my RRSP trading account. The 0.85% max. drawdown this
quarter is impressive though. I sometimes lose more than that in a
single position. Sterling Ratio 0.22 1.44 Excess Return 2.29% 17.46%
SDev Return per Trade 1.01% 2.21% Kurtosis 1.89 -0.93 Skewness 1.65 0.72
Despite my modest 2.4% return this quarter, it's not a good number in
light of the market liftoff. My low <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/">modified Sterling Ratio</a> says so.
On the other hand, the statistics from my trades improved. I achieved
consistency by lowering the standard deviation of my trades and skewed
my trade returns more to the positive. Yet another thing to caution is
my high kurtosis value. Which means my total returns are due to big
profits from a couple of trades. Other than these, there is not much to
add about the rest of the data. 95th Percentile P&amp;L \$193.49 \$421.15

<h2>Goal for the Fourth Quarter</h2>
<p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/june-and-second-quarter-2010-trading-review/">goal from the previous quarter</a> is to learn and build my first indicator in JForex. I achieved
that just this week. However, I plan to change direction in my work by
using less JForex and using more custom tools. My goal for the next
quarter is to learn R programming and
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">implement a JForex to R
data exchange system</span> (done, good old CSV files).</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Recent lack of actions in the market has given me opportunities to focus
less on the day-to-day market action and more on my own trading
development. Besides working on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative research</a>, one of the
tasks that I like to do is to review what I have thought previously in a
similar time. This takes us back to a year ago, August of 2009.
Headlines from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2009/08/">my fifteen posts back then</a> shows that I was trying
desperately (in hindsight) to short the market. Why would I do that?
Take a look at this 3-year long weekly chart of S&amp;P500.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="S&amp;P500 weekly
chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-08-18-SPX_wkly.png" />][][/caption] On the chart, August 2009 looked like a great
shorting opportunity. The resistance level at 1000 seem too good to be
true (it was). In fact, I said the following words on August 22, 2009:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been much talk of economic recovery and
a new bull market is already with us, I still am not convinced just
yet. True, the bears might be MIA. But all signs say that this bull
weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re seeing is standing on thin ice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How wrong I was. Since breaking the 1000 resistance back then, the S&amp;P
hitched on the bull train to steam upward steadily on to 1150 (Figure
1). It took a break there and continued on to 1207. Looking through my
trades back then, I eventually stopped shorting the market after S&amp;P
broke above 1025. That was the good part. The bad part is that I wasn't
able to change my view and remained stubbornly bearish (but at least
didn't commit to any new shorts) for weeks afterward. If I were to sum
up my lesson in the past year, here's what I would say to myself back in
August 2009.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trading is not about being right. It is about knowing when you are
wrong <em>and</em> doing something about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a final note, it was in August of last year that I started to paper
trade the forex market. I can't believe it has been a whole year
already!</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Market volatility continues in June. I took a more aggressive approach
this month and executed more trades in my RRSP trading account. The
monthly return is excellent but I noticed a few issues with my trading.
These will be the main topic of this post. Let's go over some
performance data. Seeing that it is the end of the second quarter, I
will do a quarterly statistical report. I couldn't do <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">a monthly review
like I used to</a> because I trade much less frequently now. Note that
the October data is from last year's forex trading. That was the best
month I've had. I am attaching the data here just for comparison.
<strong>Quarterly Metric Q2 October</strong> Sarting Fund \$8,000.00 End of Quarter
Fund \$9,404.87 Total Net Profit \$1,404.87 Gross Profit \$1,800 Gross
Loss -\$395 Profit Factor 4.56 1.75 Net Profit % <strong>17.56%</strong> 4.19% Max.
Drawdown % 3.36% 2.32% Total Commission \$155.1 Commission / Net Return
<strong>11.04%</strong> This highlight the bane of my problem trading my RRSP.
Although <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> offers the best commission in Canada as far as I
know, it is still much higher than those offered by brokers in the
states. However, this is a self-directed RRSP trading account, so it's
not like I can just switch broker. I will just have to stop being so
active in my trading for this particular account. Sterling Ratio 1.44
0.65 Excess Return 17.46% 4.14% SDev Return per Trade 2.21% 0.79%
Kurtosis -0.93 8.53 Skewness 0.72 2.49 These statistics above show my
second problem. Although I am very profitable so far, my return per
trade is not consistent. The distribution is too flat and not skewed
enough to the positive for my liking. A standard deviation less than 1%,
a slightly positive kurtosis, and a skewness above 1.0 would be ideal.
95th Percentile P&amp;L \$421.15 \$70.11 5th Percentile P&amp;L -\$102.13

Win% / Loss% 3.12 2.21 Max. Conseq. Winners 5 4 Max. Conseq. Losers 3 6
Largest Winning Trade \$464.05 \$171.79 Largest Losing Trade -\$116.75
-\$44.17 Most of my winning are due to <a href="../sold-12-cve-to-puts-2-90-mark-27-50-10-gain/">this Cenovus short in May</a> and
<a href="../sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">this CIBC short in June</a>. Avg. Time Held 5.17 days 2.18 hours Aside
from trading my RRSP account, I have finally opened a live <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">forex
account at Dukascopy</a>. My time remains split between developing
automated strategies for trading forex and manual equity trading as
usual. My JForex contest strategy in June ends up near the bottom again
as I took the wrong side of the move on USD/CAD. The JForex contest will
start with a new set of rules for July. Namely that strategies need to
be fully automated and winnings from each trade cannot be excessive
(50%) to prevent an all-in approach that's been dominating the contest.
My revised strategy is ready. It is now version 2.14 since the first
release in April.</p>
<h2>Goal for July</h2>
<p>My goal for July is to learn the indicators part of the JForex API and
to program my first custom JForex indicator from my other collection. I
will be away in Hong Kong for two weeks in July for some family matter.
So there's not much time to work.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>May 6th was a historical day in the market. The [Dow tanked 9% in
minutes but climbed back up near the end of the day][]. We have since
closed below that level later in the month. The bears seem to have
finally awoken. I closed two trades in May totalling a decent gain of
10% in my RRSP trading account. The first was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-12-cve-to-puts-2-90-mark-27-50-10-gain/">shorting CVE.TO</a>, which
made me 10%. The second was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-110-tck-b-to-36-03-stopped-out-at-breakeven/">long TCK/B.TO</a>, which ended in breakeven.
I took the second half of the month off for my wedding in Dominican
Republic. I opened two positions before leaving for vacation. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cm-to-10oct-puts-5-00-mark-74-02/">shorted
CM.TO</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-380-hnd-to-7-25-stop-7-00/">bought some HND.TO</a>. The market made a roller coaster
run up and then down while I was away. So I wasn't able to cash in on
the move. As for my forex endeavour, I bombed the JForex contest this
month. I started well with a 60% gain in the first week but I got greedy
and tried to go for higher. My contest account (demo only, not real
cash) whipsawed around breakeven a few times afterward. Then I just gave
up on this month's contest. I verified with the official that my
startegy wouldn't have qualified anyway because I was manually
intervening too many times. Nevertheless, I updated my automated trading
strategy for June before going on vacation. I will be back at it again
competing in June. But not until my wife and I can settle down in our
new home first. We are still unpacking, buying furnitures, and tidying
up our new place as of this first weekend in June.</p>

hindsight, the retracement after testing the \$37 resistance held the
50% level near the close. That was a bullish sign that I missed at the
time and only realized during my weekend review. As you know, the TSX
market gapped about 2% up and S&amp;P gapped about 4% up right at the open.
The market traded in a range all day but managed to hold the gap.
However, EUR/USD closed its gap and is testing 1.27 support as I write
this. The EUR/USD pair will be an important pair to watch as the
European Union drama unfolds. With regard to TCK, Figure 1 speaks for
itself. It gapped up about 8% and closed up 8.78% at \$39.53. I decided
not to chase the market early on today as the reward/risk ratio just
isn't as appealing anymore. There are always opportunities sailing
around the corner. So there is no need to go out of breath chasing that
one missed boat.</p>
