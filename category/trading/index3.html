            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I typed a rather long reply on the SMB Training blog to <a href="http://www.smbtraining.com/blog/traders-ask-how-much-capital-do-i-need-to-trade">the question of
how much capital one needs to start trading</a>. So I thought I might as
well expand on this frequently asked question for traders visiting here.
Here is my process. The first thing to realize is the fact that trading
is a business. And like any business, the single most important question
to ask is -- what is your bottom line? That can be simplified to two
parts. What do you expect to make and what are your costs? Let's
consider your expectation first. You can't estimate your expectation if
you don't know what you did (that would be a haphazard guess). When I
dipped my hands in trading forex the first time. I started by paper
trading a demo account for a few months. As I was unfamiliar with
trading forex, that provided me with a risk-free opportunity to learn.
Equally more importantly, it serves as a Monte Carlo experiment (perhaps
more on this another time) to figure out my expected performance
statistics in this particular market (for example, here's my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">January
2010 review</a>). That is how you can scientifically derive your trading
expectation. Based on history. Yes, past performance is no guarantee of
future return. But at least it should give you a ballpark figure. So
unless someone can suggest a better method, you need to seriously grind
it out on a demo account first. (I only said this is straightforward. I
didn't say this is easy.) Fortunately, that is the hard part. Next step
to figuring out your costs is easy. Just calculate your trading
commission, data fees, etc. Then estimate how much fees you are paying
per trade. This is the cost basis of your trading. Then here are the
steps for calculating your initial capital need.</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate your average return percentage (of total principle) per
    trade from your paper trading.</li>
<li>Make an educated guess on your capital need, just to initialize the
    numerical process.</li>
<li>Calculate how much average amount of money you expect to make per
    trade using #1 and #2.</li>
<li>Divide your cost basis per trade with #3 to get a percentage of
    cost per trade.</li>
<li>Reiterate steps #2 to #4 until your percentage of cost per trade
    is acceptable. i.e. increase your capital (#2) if your percentage
    of cost is too high, and vice versa.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, say you expect to make an average +1% of your total account
per trade (step #1). Then let's say you thought an \$10,000 account is
enough (#2). \$10,000 x 0.01 = \$100. So you can expect to make an
average of \$100 per trade (#3). And let's say your fees is \$5 per
trade. A round-trip (buy and sell) would cost you \$5 x 2 = \$10. Thus,
#4 is found by \$10 / \$100 = 10%. Which means you'll be set back by
10% on every single trade. That cost percentage is too high. Then let's
double the capital to \$20,000 and go through steps #2 to #4 again.
Assuming your fees per trade is fixed, which is most likely for small
accounts. You'll find that your cost percentage is 5% for a \$20,000
account based on the same conditions. Perhaps 5% is acceptable for you?
If not, raise your capital estimate again and re-do the calculations (a
spreadsheet would be useful). The process is straightforward and
unambiguous. Once you've done your paper trading, the actual calculation
should take less time to do than reading this post.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I made my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">first RRSP trade to short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) using
puts</a> in April. I also made my first careless mistake in my RRSP by
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-just-made-a-grave-fundamental-mistake-in-my-cve-to-trade/">buying more contracts instead of closing the CVE.TO position</a> as I
intended. As of this writing, I am still holding my puts options as the
slow decline seem to be underway. <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6421BP20100503">China's decision to hike reserve
ratio</a> is also helping by strengthening the dollar and putting another
warning on recent risk appetite. Despite putting my real money on the
line, my main focus lately has been the Dukascopy JForex Strategy
Contest. According to their rankings page, I finished at 4th place for
April's contest. Which means I may receive a USD \$1,000 credit to my
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">trading account at Dukascopy</a>. Even if I were to trade a \$5,000
account as I have done in my paper trading, I couldn't have earned 20%
in a single month <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">based on my past performance</a>. This contest is a
great way for me to fill my forex account with no monetary risk.
Frankly, I was just <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-gamble-or-not-to-gamble/">hoping to squeeze in a top 10</a> because I started
late in the April contest. So I am very happy to finish at such a good
position and receive (hopefully) a decent sum of prize money! For anyone
interested, I have discussed about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/">my winning automated strategy</a>
previously. Feel free to take a look at it to see what got me a 4th
place finish. I will be away on vacation in the last two weeks of May. I
don't expect much to happen with my trading this month as I'm inundated
with personal matters. My primary focus is still the JForex Strategy
Contest. I will be using a new semi-automated strategy this time. My
goal is to finish in the top 6 again.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) tested 27.50 support and then bounced back to
break the short-term downtrend line above 28.50 or so, see Figure 1.
Naturally, I don't want to turn a profitable trade into a losing one. So
I wanted to sell <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-10jul17-puts-30-00-mx-2-45-mark-28-64/">my puts options on CVE.TO</a> while I can still exit at
near breakeven. However, as I am new to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> and unfamiliar
with their interface, I made the careless mistake of buying six more
contracts instead of selling the six that I have!</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Cenovus Energy
(CVE.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-23-CVE-TO.png" />][][/caption] I realized my mistake soon afterward from
checking my account. Imagine my surprise to find that I am an owner of
12 puts contracts on CVE.TO. So I wanted to cut my losses immediately.
Unfortunately, the energy sector (XLF) and crude oil just broke above
some key resistances and CVE.TO bumped up a few more points. The right
thing to do is to ignore my unfortunate losses and just exit the
position, as that was what I intended to do. But I didn't. I decided to
not panic and analyze the stock yet another time. CVE.TO is definitely
weak. It is lagging behind others in the sector. Other energy companies
are breaking above resistance levels but CVE.TO is still below its 29.50
resistance. Yet, the fact is that the trend in the sector is upward.
Which is very bad for me. I am still holding this short CVE.TO position
over the weekend as it hasn't broken my 29.50 mental stop yet. I can
give my bearish reasons here upon observing the tape this afternoon
(e.g. Goldman Sachs Canada is dumping shares), but they would just be
excuses under the current circumstances. In any case, this is an
embarrassing confession as I've violated one of the most <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">basic rules of
trading</a>. This position is near breakeven on paper as of the close.
But who knows what can happen over the weekend. Rather than risking 3%,
which is already too much, I am now risking a <em>maximum</em> of 10% on this
trade. What have I done... The high commission in trading options is
affecting my decision. If this were a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex</a> position, I would have
dumped it all without giving it a second thought. This is a sign for me
to stop trading options altogether. It is better to stay with a
long-only equity strategy in my RRSP than get eaten up by commissions or
take excessive risks as I am doing now.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585424331?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=quantisan-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1585424331">Think and Grow Rich</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=quantisan-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1585424331" /> (affiliate) for the third time
last weekend. One of the key ideas presented in the book is to set
realistic long term goal and stick with it every single day. This
reminded me of something that I've done lately which I think is very
helpful in disciplining myself in my trading. That something is this
table below. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-20-monetarygoal.png"><img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-20-monetarygoal.png" /></a> This is a table of my planned deposit and
return for my trading account. The table shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount that I plan to deposit into my trading account each year</li>
<li>the accumulated principal at the end of each year</li>
<li>the expected yield, which is based on my historical trading
    performance from the past 10 years of trading, minus the [couple of
    blowups I've had][] (which is a reason why I am starting from
    scratch in this table)</li>
</ul>
<p>Estimating future values is nothing new. What I find particularly useful
in this table is the fact that they show the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>My minimum savings goal for each year (deposit column). So that I
    can project an annual budget.</li>
<li>Effect of compounding. A reminder that I don't need to perform
    exquisitely in my trading to reach my goal. This helps keep my
    trading expectation realistic and not over-trade.</li>
<li>I can trade for a living after 16 years even with my conservative
    expectations. This is my ultimate goal.</li>
<li>I can update this table at the end of each year with real data so
    that I can see where I stand with respect to my goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a simple and easy to do trading goal visualization. I visualize
this table often to remind myself what I need to do. Both in terms of
setting a bar above to push myself as well as limiting my expectations
to realism. A problem many new traders have, myself included, is the
need to perform, and in a big way (making it big in that one trade), or
conversely, afraid to miss opportunities. This table helps me keep a
realistic mentality just so I don't <em>back up the truck</em> in any
particular trade. As the table clearly shows, I don't need to take
unnecessary risk to reach my goal of trading for a living. What is your
trading goal? What is your plan to achieve it? How do you keep yourself
motivated? These are some fundamental questions that this table can be
helpful in answering.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>It is that time of the month again when I do my trading performance
review. However, I did not make any trade this month. Not because I was
procrastinating, but I spent all of my time this month to work on my
quantitative projects. This review will be a recap of my backend trading
development. I said in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/february-2010-trading-performance-review/">last month's performance review</a> that my
goal for March is "to write a rudimentary data analysis and
visualization program for historical forex data." Well, I finished <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/data-scraping-the-toronto-stock-exchange-extracting-3660-companies-data/">half
of it</a> and then realized that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/from-object-oriented-programming-to-object-oriented-design/">I need a better design for the
software</a>. So I studied yet another programming book (finished 3
programming books this month), on object oriented design and analysis.
The other major event for me this month is that I finally opened a
self-directed RRSP account at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> because the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/considering-investment-options-for-my-first-rrsp/">tax benefit is
too good to pass</a>. Consequently, I am starting to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-first-analysis-of-the-sptsx-60-index/">study the Canadian
stock market</a> for trading with a conservative, intermediate-term
manner (not buy and hold though). Lastly, it seems that I might be back
to trading forex sooner than I have thought. I signed up for an
automated trading contest at <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143">Dukascopy</a> earlier this week. Since they
are offering a cash prize, I thought I might as well reschedule and work
on my forex stuff now. I will write more on this topic at another time.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If the idea of handing your RRSP contributions over to a sales person
(a.k.a. financial advisor) at a bank isn't appealing to you, then it is
time to consider your investment choices. I am about to contribute for
the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/considering-investment-options-for-my-first-rrsp/">first time ever into my RRSP</a> this year. So I performed my due
diligence by researching and evaluating my choices. This post is a
ranking of my findings. I evaluate each investment strategy according to
three criterias, in descending order of importance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk</strong>. Will I lose sleep at night if I put all my money in it?</li>
<li><strong>Reward</strong>. How much can I potentially gain?</li>
<li><strong>Effort</strong>. How much time and energy do I need to spend on it?</li>
</ul>
<p>My overall portfolio is exposed to enough risk already from my other
trading activities. So my risk appetite is leaning towards a
conservative approach. Also note that I factor in costs as a part of my
risk assessment. I place a 40% emphasis on this criteria. Next, I
consider the return of each investment vehicle using a 40% weight. For
obvious reasons. Lastly, I prefer something that requires as little time
and effort as possible. I weight this criteria at 20%. As I've said
numerous times, I don't like the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/">limitations in a registered
account</a>. It is like trying to invest with one hand tied behind my
back. I do not want to put much effort to manage this account because I
can do better in my regular trading. The resulting ranking of the six
types of markets <em>that I am considering</em> for my RRSP (and TFSA) is as
follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Guaranteed savings</li>
<li>Indices or sectors (through passive mutual funds or ETF's)</li>
<li>Fixed income (using a mutual fund or ETF bond index)</li>
<li>Gold</li>
<li>Stocks</li>
<li>Actively managed mutual funds</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing of note about investing in physical gold within a registered
account is that it can only be done at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> as far as I know.
Although I doubt they are the only one. Here is the table I used to
estimate this ranking. I give each category a score from 1 (bad) to 5
(good) based on my own experience and my sentiment of future market
condition. So yes, it is a very crude guess at best. Nevertheless, the
table shows that my best choice is to either put my RRSP money in a
savings account or invest in indices using passive mutual funds (like
the TD e-Series) or ETF's. However, I plan to do both. I will trade
indices in my RRSP and put my TFSA money in a high yield savings
account. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="493" caption="RRSP
