            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Recent lack of actions in the market has given me opportunities to focus
less on the day-to-day market action and more on my own trading
development. Besides working on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative research</a>, one of the
tasks that I like to do is to review what I have thought previously in a
similar time. This takes us back to a year ago, August of 2009.
Headlines from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2009/08/">my fifteen posts back then</a> shows that I was trying
desperately (in hindsight) to short the market. Why would I do that?
Take a look at this 3-year long weekly chart of S&amp;P500.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="S&amp;P500 weekly
chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-08-18-SPX_wkly.png" />][][/caption] On the chart, August 2009 looked like a great
shorting opportunity. The resistance level at 1000 seem too good to be
true (it was). In fact, I said the following words on August 22, 2009:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been much talk of economic recovery and
a new bull market is already with us, I still am not convinced just
yet. True, the bears might be MIA. But all signs say that this bull
weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re seeing is standing on thin ice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How wrong I was. Since breaking the 1000 resistance back then, the S&amp;P
hitched on the bull train to steam upward steadily on to 1150 (Figure
1). It took a break there and continued on to 1207. Looking through my
trades back then, I eventually stopped shorting the market after S&amp;P
broke above 1025. That was the good part. The bad part is that I wasn't
able to change my view and remained stubbornly bearish (but at least
didn't commit to any new shorts) for weeks afterward. If I were to sum
up my lesson in the past year, here's what I would say to myself back in
August 2009.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trading is not about being right. It is about knowing when you are
wrong <em>and</em> doing something about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a final note, it was in August of last year that I started to paper
trade the forex market. I can't believe it has been a whole year
already!</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Market volatility continues in June. I took a more aggressive approach
this month and executed more trades in my RRSP trading account. The
monthly return is excellent but I noticed a few issues with my trading.
These will be the main topic of this post. Let's go over some
performance data. Seeing that it is the end of the second quarter, I
will do a quarterly statistical report. I couldn't do <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">a monthly review
like I used to</a> because I trade much less frequently now. Note that
the October data is from last year's forex trading. That was the best
month I've had. I am attaching the data here just for comparison.
<strong>Quarterly Metric Q2 October</strong> Sarting Fund \$8,000.00 End of Quarter
Fund \$9,404.87 Total Net Profit \$1,404.87 Gross Profit \$1,800 Gross
Loss -\$395 Profit Factor 4.56 1.75 Net Profit % <strong>17.56%</strong> 4.19% Max.
Drawdown % 3.36% 2.32% Total Commission \$155.1 Commission / Net Return
<strong>11.04%</strong> This highlight the bane of my problem trading my RRSP.
Although <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> offers the best commission in Canada as far as I
know, it is still much higher than those offered by brokers in the
states. However, this is a self-directed RRSP trading account, so it's
not like I can just switch broker. I will just have to stop being so
active in my trading for this particular account. Sterling Ratio 1.44
0.65 Excess Return 17.46% 4.14% SDev Return per Trade 2.21% 0.79%
Kurtosis -0.93 8.53 Skewness 0.72 2.49 These statistics above show my
second problem. Although I am very profitable so far, my return per
trade is not consistent. The distribution is too flat and not skewed
enough to the positive for my liking. A standard deviation less than 1%,
a slightly positive kurtosis, and a skewness above 1.0 would be ideal.
95th Percentile P&amp;L \$421.15 \$70.11 5th Percentile P&amp;L -\$102.13
-\$33.60 Net Profit Mid 90% Only \$0.29 \$46.34 Total # of Trades 14 34

0.12% Average Winning % 2.59% 0.66% Average Losing % -0.83% -0.30% Ratio
Win% / Loss% 3.12 2.21 Max. Conseq. Winners 5 4 Max. Conseq. Losers 3 6
Largest Winning Trade \$464.05 \$171.79 Largest Losing Trade -\$116.75
-\$44.17 Most of my winning are due to <a href="../sold-12-cve-to-puts-2-90-mark-27-50-10-gain/">this Cenovus short in May</a> and
<a href="../sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">this CIBC short in June</a>. Avg. Time Held 5.17 days 2.18 hours Aside
from trading my RRSP account, I have finally opened a live <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">forex
account at Dukascopy</a>. My time remains split between developing
automated strategies for trading forex and manual equity trading as
usual. My JForex contest strategy in June ends up near the bottom again
as I took the wrong side of the move on USD/CAD. The JForex contest will
start with a new set of rules for July. Namely that strategies need to
be fully automated and winnings from each trade cannot be excessive
(50%) to prevent an all-in approach that's been dominating the contest.
My revised strategy is ready. It is now version 2.14 since the first
release in April.</p>
<h2>Goal for July</h2>
<p>My goal for July is to learn the indicators part of the JForex API and
to program my first custom JForex indicator from my other collection. I
will be away in Hong Kong for two weeks in July for some family matter.
So there's not much time to work.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>May 6th was a historical day in the market. The [Dow tanked 9% in
minutes but climbed back up near the end of the day][]. We have since
closed below that level later in the month. The bears seem to have
finally awoken. I closed two trades in May totalling a decent gain of
10% in my RRSP trading account. The first was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-12-cve-to-puts-2-90-mark-27-50-10-gain/">shorting CVE.TO</a>, which
made me 10%. The second was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-110-tck-b-to-36-03-stopped-out-at-breakeven/">long TCK/B.TO</a>, which ended in breakeven.
I took the second half of the month off for my wedding in Dominican
Republic. I opened two positions before leaving for vacation. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cm-to-10oct-puts-5-00-mark-74-02/">shorted
CM.TO</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-380-hnd-to-7-25-stop-7-00/">bought some HND.TO</a>. The market made a roller coaster
run up and then down while I was away. So I wasn't able to cash in on
the move. As for my forex endeavour, I bombed the JForex contest this
month. I started well with a 60% gain in the first week but I got greedy
and tried to go for higher. My contest account (demo only, not real
cash) whipsawed around breakeven a few times afterward. Then I just gave
up on this month's contest. I verified with the official that my
startegy wouldn't have qualified anyway because I was manually
intervening too many times. Nevertheless, I updated my automated trading
strategy for June before going on vacation. I will be back at it again
competing in June. But not until my wife and I can settle down in our
new home first. We are still unpacking, buying furnitures, and tidying
up our new place as of this first weekend in June.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I wrote last Friday, I took a long position in Teck Resources
(TCK-B.TO) at \$36.03 but got <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-110-tck-b-to-36-03-stopped-out-at-breakeven/">stopped out at breakeven</a>. In
hindsight, the retracement after testing the \$37 resistance held the
50% level near the close. That was a bullish sign that I missed at the
time and only realized during my weekend review. As you know, the TSX
market gapped about 2% up and S&amp;P gapped about 4% up right at the open.
The market traded in a range all day but managed to hold the gap.
However, EUR/USD closed its gap and is testing 1.27 support as I write
this. The EUR/USD pair will be an important pair to watch as the
European Union drama unfolds. With regard to TCK, Figure 1 speaks for
itself. It gapped up about 8% and closed up 8.78% at \$39.53. I decided
not to chase the market early on today as the reward/risk ratio just
isn't as appealing anymore. There are always opportunities sailing
around the corner. So there is no need to go out of breath chasing that
one missed boat.</p>
