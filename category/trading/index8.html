                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/" rel='bookmark'>January 2010 Trading Performance Review</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>2010 didn't begin well for me. I experienced my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/first-2010-trading-drawdown-analysis-on-the-verge-of-a-new-record/">biggest drawdown</a> so
far at -3.95% (see Figure 1 for my account balance graph) in my demo
account. Given that I only risk 0.2% per trade, this is a relatively
substantial setback. Ironically, I was in the process of filling paper
work to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">open a live account</a> when this performance setback hit me.
Change of plan. Now I'll have to postpone live trading until I can at
least recover my demo account balance. To do that, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/work-harder-trade-fewer-in-a-long-and-excruciating-trading-drawdown/">tightened up</a> my
risk exposure and focused on playing only <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">my best setup</a>. By the
close of the month, my demo account is sitting at -1.2% for January. At
least I have made it some way from the bottom with a few <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">good
trades</a>. This is also the first negative month for me since beginning
trading forex in September, just 4 months ago.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="January 2010
Demo Account Balance"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/january_2010_account_balance.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Aside from my performance, a notable change this month for my trading is
the fact that I've been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/barred-from-trading-at-work-a-curse-or-a-gift/">barred from trading during the day</a>. This
forced me to trade less, which is a good thing. On the other hand, I'm
not able to manage my stops as often as I would have liked. As such,
I've been helpless at times and watched some profitable positions <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-gbpjpy-144-24-stop-143-60-target-148/">turn
sour</a>. Whereas before, I would have at least moved my stops to
breakeven when the price moved away enough. Obviously, this calls for a
drastic change to my current trading strategy. For one, I'm looking at
higher timeframes for my trading now to catch slower moves. Secondly, my
top priority for the next few months is to develop some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">trading bots</a>
to manage my risks while I'm away.</p>

<h2>Goal for February</h2>
<p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/december-2009-trading-performance-review/">goal from the previous month</a> is to think more and trade less.
Well, I managed the latter part but the former still requires work as
evident by my negative return this month. For February, my strategy is
to keep trading with half the risk exposure (i.e. 0.1% per trade) to
recover my account back to its all-time high in beginning of January.
I'm just about 2% away at this moment. My goal for February is to get
acquinted with MQL4 so that I can begin to develop expert advisors to
manage my risks during the day and overnight.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well, they've done it. The IT guys at my day job have blocked access to
streaming market data. I can't trade at lunch anymore or even doodle on
charts! Yet, this event merely pushes my agenda forward as I've never
intended to trade actively at work (i.e. no intention of getting myself
fired). Although I have honestly been pushing my luck these weeks. For
the longest time, I've traded <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/stocks/">stocks</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/options/">options</a>, and even dabbled
in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures</a> (not while at work!). On a whim in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2009/09/">September 2009</a>, I
decided to try out the foreign exchange markets with a demo account just
to see what the fuzz is about. Since then I have not looked back... Nah!
But no, trading stocks still remain my main staple. I am just curious
about forex and it never hurts to broaden my understanding of the
capital market. I must admit though, forex suits my trading style. I
fully intend to incorporate it in my portfolio in the long run. So what
is my plan about forex trading? What do I want to achieve with my
obsessive <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> lately? My paper trading objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">trading weaknesses</a></li>
<li>Identify my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">strengths</a></li>
<li>Experiment with various <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading signals</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">strategies</a></li>
<li>Get a <em>feel</em> of trading the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex market</a></li>
<li>Understand the dynamics between currencies</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd be a fool to claim that I have achieved my objectives. Trading is a
never-ending learning process. This is nothing but the first stage in my
forex trading sojourn. The next stage now, as I have intended from the
beginning, is to automate some trading processes from what I've learned.
Such that I can remain active in the markets even when I am not around.
Not for more profits, but to reduce risks. This need became blatantly
obvious to me as some of my positions were left running through Asia and
early Europe. Profits were sometimes turned into losses. If only my
stops were moved. Fortunately, the vigorous paper trading in the past
few months does have its advantage. It has given me ideas for 3 new
trading systems. I have disclosed one concept with my post on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC
setup</a>. As I was saying, being blocked from trading at work merely
pushes my agenda forward. I haven't touched a single line of code for 5
months. Now I have no choice but to work on developing some
semi-<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading systems</a> to continue my forex paper trading.
My ultimate goal is to let myself do the high-level decision making,
such as which pair to trade, which side of the position, and when. Then
let loose a simple algorithmic trading system to take care of the timing
for entries and exits, and some basic <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex
trading</a> life continues.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Arguably the single most important skill a trader needs to master in
trading any market is to <strong>cut your losses short and let your profits
run</strong>. This is simply another saying of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">managing risks</a> and
maximizing opportunities. However, this is easier said than done. Ever
tried to cut your losses short but only to see the price run in your
favour soon afterward? Or, that you've built a sizable and profitable
position only to see it turn into a loss? As with much of other trading
skills, managing your trade is not an exact science. That is why you
need to have probabilities in your favour on every step. You enter a
trade because it is <em>likely</em> to be profitable. You exit a trade when it
is not. If you can apply this axiom on every trade you do, it is
<em>likely</em> that you will be profitable, with all things being equal. So
what does this have to do with cut your losses short and let your
profits run? In this post, I will discuss one <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy</a> which
I use to do exactly that. The key to this strategy is divide and
conquer. Instead of taking one trade for each position, consider taking
multiple smaller trades by scaling in and out of a position. That way,
you can have more freedom in your trade by using your position size to
your advantage. Here's the gist of the strategy and the rationale for
it. The rule is simple: increase a position by scaling in as the
probability of success increases; and decrease a position by scaling out
as the probability of success decreases. One way to do this is to add on
a position as the price breaks support on a faster timeframe. You keep
adding on this position as long as your trade setup (on a higher time
frame) is valid. At the same time, you limit your risk by <em>lowering the
stop</em> of your previous trade to breakeven. That way, even though you are
stockpiling a position, the overall risk stays the same. This is an
essential step in the technique. Otherwise the risk would just multiply.
It is as much managing the entries as well as the stops/exits. Let's put
this into perspective with a real-world example. Figure 1 shows the
support levels for my EUR/CHF short on a 3-hour chart. I identified this
trade using my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC setup</a> on the daily chart. The failed break above
1.4800 on January 14 was the signal for entry. I took an initial short
position risking 0.20% of my account as EUR/CHF reverted back below
1.4800 (first support, not marked). Then I kept adding on to this
position below 1.4787, 1.4761, and 1.4742 supports as shown in Fig. 1
with the horizontal dashed red lines. On each subsequent new entry, I
move the stop on the previous entry to b/e. I only risk 0.1% on each of
these additions with half the position size after the initial entry. As
I keep adding, I keep moving the stops one step behind. So on my third
scale-in, my initial stop have locked in some profits at a price level
between my first and second entries. Figure 2 is the same chart but with
the actual filled orders (yellow triangles) and current stops (red
lines) marked. As you can see, I have effectively accumulated a sizable
position size in this short while limiting my risk to just a fraction
(0.2% versus 1.0%) if I were to enter my maximum size all at once.
Furthermore, my confidence and probability of this trade increase
gradually as I see the short-term support levels break one after
another. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURCHF,
3-hour, showing supports"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-18-EURCHF_3h.PNG" />][][/caption] [caption id=""
align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EUR/CHF, 3-hour, showing
orders"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-18-EURCHF_3h_2.PNG" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-18-EURCHF_3h_2.PNG">1</a>[/caption] There are limitations to this strategy.
First of all, this strategy is mostly suitable for trading setups with
an expected high reward/risk ratio. You might not want to use this for a
range trading strategy as there's probably not enough price move to
break the trade into steps. Secondly, this technique is mostly for an
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated system</a> or longer term manual strategies (hours or more).
Just so you have sufficient time to manage all these extra work without
adding on an unnecessary amount of stress. Lastly, an obvious downside
to this approach is that your account will take a hit from the spreads
and commissions for each move. So do take those costs into account in
building your own adaptation to this concept. Now that I've discussed my
scaling-in technique, what do you think? <strong>Update January 22:</strong> I've
closed this position and it turns out to be <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/closed-eurchf-and-gbpchf-shorts-best-trade-ever/">one of my best trade
ever</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
I write this as I am in my [first trading drawdown of 2010][]. As I said
[previously][first trading drawdown of 2010], I find that I am still
ill-trained to respond to big drawdowns. I caught myself over trading
again hoping to rake in a few quick paper bucks in my demo account to
get myself out. However, the ability to maintain discipline and
performance under stress is what separate the pros from newbies like me.
I know what I must do at the back of my head but I took the easy way.
This trading drawdown is definitely bringing the worst trader in me. As
Dr. Steenbarger wrote in his post on [Stress and Performance in
Trading][],

> "... one reason stress might affect performance among traders is by
> skewing their assessments of risk and reward. Under pressure, traders
> may narrow their cognitive scope to only the information most salient
> to them (availability bias) or relevant to their expectations
> (confirmation bias); focus only on superficial qualities of
> observations (representativeness heuristic); or become more likely to
> take profits than losses (disposition effect). In other words, stress
> disrupts performance by altering normal, sound information
> processing."

In addition to a narrowed mindset, the cause of my bad habit to over
trade during a big drawdown is that I subconciously associate the need
to recover my account balance with the need to trade. Nothing will
happen if you don't trade, right? Well, at least you won't lose anymore
than you have. That would have been a good start. So I considered to
ease back on trading by focusing on [my quant work][]. Then I realized
this is yet another misconception. I was merely walking away from my
problem. What I needed to do is to face it, not with mindless trading
though. **During a stressful drawdown, work harder and think plenty
about the market, *not* about recovering from your drawdown**. In the
mean time, only trade your best strategy to reap the best probability of
profits. At the end of the day, nobody can dig yourself out of an
account drawdown but you. Something must have been wrong with your
trading or your current perception of the market to get you in a
drawdown. Or, it could very well be just plain old bad luck. In any
case, take a step back from trading and use the opportunity to realign
yourself with the market or wait for market conditions to sync back with
you. This is a forgotten lesson that I have wrote about in a [previous
drawdown][]. I have since added an additional section in my [trading
rules][] to impose it upon myself with this re-ocurring problem. I can
never get rid of large drawdowns completely because they are a regular
part of trading. This particular one has been a great self-discovering
experience. Ultimately, learning to cope with trading under stress is
one of my top training priorities to achieve before moving on to trading
a live account with real money.
