                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/october-2009-trading-performance-review/" rel='bookmark'>October 2009 Trading Performance Review</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>October is the first full month in which I traded forex. Naturally, this
is the first of my monthly trading performance review. Note that all the
trades were on a demo account with imaginary money only. But I still
took this seriously. My goal is to double this demo account starting
from CAD\$5000. Once that is accomplished, I will start live trading
with real money. Who knows how long this might take. Hopefully by then,
I will have a respectable set of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setups</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">strategies</a>, and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools">quant tools</a> developed. Anyway, let's get on with the monthly review.
As this is only my first month trading currencies after spending 8 years
in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/stocks/">stocks</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures</a>, my trading this month is marked by a lot
of experimentation. As can be seen in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trading log</a>, I performed
abysmally for the first couple of weeks. The last of my bad string ended
when I took an uncalled for trade <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-undisciplined-trade-shorted-eurusd-1-499-stopped-1-505-62-pips/">based on what I thought rather than
what I saw</a>. Not all is lost this month as I managed to write out the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">first of my forex trading setups</a> from the trials and errors. Since
then, I had a string of winners to push my monthly tally deeper into the
positive. While this is definitely good, I am cautious and doubtful to
my initial success because I am just at the right place, at the right
time. Because we might very well be witnessing the printing of the top
from this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/inter-market-analysis-after-a-new-2009-high-in-the-equity-market/">epic V-shaped rally since March</a>. The moves in the markets
were very strong and very rapid this last week. I just happen to be on
the right side of the trades.</p>
<h2>Performance Statistics Review</h2>
<p>In any case, I'll get down to business with discussing the performance
statistics below. On first sight, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio">Sharpe ratio</a> at 5.25 is
impressive for this month. However, looking a few lines below, see that
if we account for only the middle 90th percentile profits and losses,
the net profit is reduced by a magnitude. (So as to see what would
happen if we truncate the biggest (un)lucky wins and losses.) That means
much of my profit for this month was because of a few big trade. In
fact, it was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-eurjpy-135-00-500-1-pips/">this lucky trade when I made +500 pips</a> in one week.</p>
<h2>Goal for Next Month</h2>
<p>What I've learned from analyzing these numbers is that I lack
consistency (like all new traders), and was perhaps just lucky. So the
goals for the coming months are simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>achieve consistency by bringing up this mid 90% net profit value;
    and</li>
<li>maintain good Sharpe ratio rating by improving my risk management
    techniques.</li>
</ol>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I paid a price last week in trading EURCHF for not knowing the
fundamental analysis about the currency pair. First of all, here's how
my trade played out. The support between 1.500 and 1.510 is apparent if
you look at Figure 1. So I went long as shown in Figure 2 (second blue
triangle from right) based on a positive divergence at a strong support
of 1.510. EURCHF stayed range bound for a over a day while my other
positions were having roller coaster rides. That's when I decided to
tighten up my stop on my EURCHF long from 1.508 to 1.5095 to limit my
risk exposure. As you can see in Figure 2, that was a bad decision. On
October 30, EURCHF made a swing downward to take out the nearby stops
and then launched upward right past my target. That would have been a
quick and low risk play if I hadn't micro-manged the trade and moved my
stop up while the daily setup was still sound. While getting stopped out
is part of the game, as there is never absolute certainty in a trade.
But in this case, the probability of this up move was substantially
greater than I would have guessed. The extra bit of information lies
outside of the chart. It seems that there is a well known secret that
the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been intervening in the market to keep
the Swiss Franc from being even more overvalued. In particular, it's
well known that the SNB has their eyes on the 1.50 and 1.51 levels in
the EURCHF pair. SNB publicly announced their intention to intervene on
March 12. Immediately following the news, the EURCHF pair exploded up
470 pips in 20 minutes that day. If you look at Figure 1, you can see
that gigantic bar on March 12. The DailyFX has an article on this
<a href="http://www.dailyfx.com/story/bio1/Swiss_Franc_Plunges_After_SNB_1236870114798.html">monumental event</a>. Since then, the SNB has been coming to the rescue
of EURCHF in very obvious ways as shown in Figure 1 with the regular
spikes in prices. Prior to this October 30 move, EURCHF had an identical
price action exactly a month before on September 29, as shown in Figure
3. Back then, EURCHF also had a positive divergence on a test of support
at 1.5080. Then next thing you know, the pair popped over a 100 pips.
Obviously, the SNB is trying hard to paint the tape on the monthly chart
of EURCHF. As I was saying, the SNB is intervening in the market to keep
their currency from further over-valuation, which is hurting their local
economy. In both cases of Sept 29 and Oct 30, if the support was broken,
EURCHF would have stepped into a grave on the chart. Just look at that
huge vacuum below 1.50 on Figure 1. In this recent case on Oct 30, even
though I did go long because of the chart, I didn't have the edge of
knowing this information. Which led me missing this easy ride because I
didn't have as much conviction in this trade as I should have.
Coincidentally, as I have been aggravating to improve the win rates of
my trades, this came hitting me right on the head. So while I'm no
economist, I should at least be aware of the fundamental forces at play
in the currencies that I trade. At the end of the day, technical
analysis may provide guidelines to the mass psychology behind price
actions, but it is the fundamental and economic forces that are
ultimately driving the market. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If you decide to write your own trading rules. Here's an explanation of
how I came about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">my 3 trading rules</a> and the reasoning behind them.
So why only 3 trading rules? There are several reasons for it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy to remember.</li>
<li>Easy to follow.</li>
<li>Easy to learn.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I've said in my 3 rules page, this list is not intended to be written
in stone. You are expected to progress from being restrained by it, to
being familiar with it, and then to being habitual with it. Thus, a
short list makes it easy to remember, to follow, and to learn. Once any
rule become an unconscious competency, you will not need it anymore and
it can be adapted or changed to address your new needs. Besides the
benefit of keeping it short, there's another reason why I'm using 3
rules. The three rules actually address my biggest trading <strong>weaknesses
in the past, present, and future</strong>. This is also the answer to this
post's title, how to draft your own 3 rules of trading. Let's get right
to it. The first rule is to tackle my archilles' heel, the bane of my
trading, based on my trading history. It is the single most important
thing that when I looked back and analysed my trades in the past few
months, or even years, which would have made my trading better. It could
be a trading strategy tweak, a trading psychology note-to-self, or a
risk management rule. Anything goes. And if that didn't really help,
consider using a popular hypothetical scenario, if you can go back in
time, what would you have told yourself back then to improve your
trading? The second rule is derived from asking the question, what is
the most important thing that I can do
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">now</span> with all of my
trades to increase my odds in this game? Let's use a hypothetical again.
Imagine that there is a trading guru here trading with you now and
watching you trade, what would s/he tell you? The last rule is to
address the future. What can you do in the times to come that can make
the most difference in your trading? What is this next step you can take
that will start the wheel going on your journey to becoming the trader
that you want to be? Whatever your trading rules are, the <strong>most
important rule</strong> about drafting your own trading rules is to be as
specific as you can. Vague or unclear rules are worse than useless
because they can give a false sense of security. Consider these three
#3 rules about the same idea. I want to ...</p>
<ol>
<li>Improve on my trades.</li>
<li>Improve on my trades by studying my trading history.</li>
<li>Improve on my trades by studying any trade with performance
    statistics beyond the middle 50% quartile.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll let you be the judge on which style you prefer. If you didn't read
any of the above, remember this, the most important rule (yes, I lied
above) for drafting your trading rules is to just write them down and
follow them. No matter what you wrote, you will eventually find ways to
improve on it if you are diligent about them. So just start somewhere
and go with it.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>
I seem to have taken up too many tasks in recent weeks. I've spent a
couple hours a day analysing, observing, and trading the [forex
market][]. Another hour or so learning RapidMiner 5. And then yet
another couple of hours catching up with the news and various blogs. All
these on top of a full time job! It has come to my attention that I
can't keep this up as I'll be too burned-out and never actually able to
get things done. Such is the bane of choices. Coincidentally, I read
this blog post today (via [TraderFeed][]) about the [paradox of
choices][]. It is basically saying that having choices, per se, can have
a diminishing rate of return (something which I've read elsewhere before
but forgotten). More choices isn't always good and fewer can be better.
And studies have found that the diminishing rate is apparently pretty
low. Here's a good quote from the article:

> "we need to redirect the energies we waste flitting from possibility
> to possibility, into understanding what we really want in life and the
> trade-offs we are willing to make."

Particularly at this early stage of my amateur quant career, there are
many trading tools (analyzer, forecaster, scanner) that I want to
develop and software ([MatLab][], RapidMiner) that I want to learn. So
what do I really want in trading by spending hours upon hours, day after
day, studying, analysing, observing, and thinking? The answer for me is
fortunately easy to find (the benefit of keeping a good written record,
i.e. this blog). Referring to my own [trading objectives][] that I wrote
last year, there is just 5 points.

1.  Application of independent and objective thinking
2.  [Understanding of capital markets][]
3.  Prudent [risk management][]
4.  Identification of [values][]
5.  Study of [quantitative finance][]

In practical terms, **my ultimate goal in trading is to develop a
trading system which requires no more than 1 hour a day of management
time**. That doesn't include research and development time, of course. I
am not trying to develop a holy grail system. I am using the term system
as in a set of processes for me to follow, not an algorithmic system.
Although that would be a tool for my system for sure. Now that I've
figure that out. My first mandate is to reduce my [paper trading][] in
forex. But rather than eliminate it completely, I'm going to increase
the timeframe from 4 hour to daily. Because trading the forex helps me
understand the capital markets (\#2 of objective). Too much of it though
would have been just for thrill and detract from my time for working in
quantitative finance (\#5). If I'm to treat this as a part-time job, I
need to have more discipline in this whole endeavour, not just in the
trading itself.

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
I started watching this video (attached below) merely out of curiosity.
Just to see what test in Japan is harder than becoming a lawyer or a
surgeon. But as I was watching it, the parallel of their recurring theme
on the goal of [Kendo][], which is to defeat yourself, rather than your
opponent, is strikingly similar to what I've been trying to accomplish
in trading. The video follows two 8th dan Kendo test candidates, Ishida
Kenichi, a National Kendo Champion 15 years ago (whom have failed this
test 4 times since), and Kai Miyamoto, a 78-year-old that has tried this
test for 24 times in 24 consecutive years and failing every time. Watch
the hour long video and take from it what you can yourself. Here are a
couple of quotes as teasers.

> "Mr. Ishida trains to teach his body not accidental swings, but only
> perfectly calculated and timed movements." (flip through any trading
> psychology book and I'm sure you'll find similar words)

Toward the end of the video, Ishida had to write an essay on the topic
of "The Sword is Soul". The translator summarized Ishida's essay as
follows.

> "The most important aspect of Kendo is to have a humble enough mind to
> admit that you are weak and train to improve yourself."

Replace the word "Kendo" with "trading" and there you have it. A
seemingly trite statement, but only when you are able to appreciate the
simplicity and truth of such words by a former Japanese National Kendo
Champion can you begin to truly learn, rather be it Kendo or trading.
