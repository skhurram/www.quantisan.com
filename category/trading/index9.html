            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am close to passing my biggest monthly drawdown ever in my forex
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> endeavour. My account drawdown is at -3.34% now. My
record was set in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/november-2009-trading-performance-review/">last November</a> at -3.44%. And it's only the 13th!
To make matters worse, this isn't one of those transient, surprise
drawdown. It is a slow and steady one. An excruciating one. See Figure 1
for my account balance graph for this month so far. Feel my pain! My
post earlier this month on [10 questions to ask yourself if you are
holding a ginormous losing position and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what
to do][] was a real harbinger. I wrote that piece at precisely the top
point on Figure 1. If only I can time my trades that well! But instead
of a single ginormous losing position, I am faced with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">losing trades</a>
one after another. Thus, drastic measures need to be taken before I mark
a new drawdown record. This post is a self-assessment on what I've done
wrong and my plan to turn this wreck around. <!--more--> [caption id=""

balance"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-13-account_balance.png" />][][/caption] Upon review of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>, it is
apparent that my account suffered because I was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/early-bird-does-not-get-the-worm-in-forex-trading/">too eager in shorting
the Aussie</a>. As a standard <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a> procedure, I kick
started my emergency protocol when my drawdown reached 3.00% last week
as I <a href="http://twitter.com/Quantisan/statuses/7522778269">tweeted</a>. Basically just reducing my risk by trading with only
half the usual position size. That was all last week. This week, I found
myself breaking another of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">trading rules</a>. I am letting this
drawdown affect my trading, in a bad way. Specifically, I am letting my
need to perform affect me by starting to day trade the GBPJPY currency
pair! If you might recall from last year, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-example-of-how-trading-in-fear-is-bad-for-your-account/">resorted to the same
desperate measure</a> (isn't it great to be able to recall my past
trading experience just like that?) and that was the month when I had
the largest drawdown. Exactly because of that. In fact, the drawdown
emergency rules posted last time are as appropriate as ever. Heck, I
will copy and paste these rules in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules/">3 rules of trading</a> as a
permanent fixture. I seem to need them quite often. I can't helped but
feel chagrined with the fact that my current situation yields itself to
a perfect follow-up to my previous post on trading drawdown. However,
this is what it is. In my next post, I will examine why I keep going
back to this same bad habit of day trading (even though I suck at it)
when I am under pressure.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[This post was updated on January 13, see addendum below.] I have
discussed my enthusiasm in shorting the Aussie a few times this week.
First trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">shorting AUD/JPY at 84.53</a>. After that got stopped
out, I re-tried at the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-retrying-audjpy-short-84-52-stop-85/">same level the next day</a>. My trade history in
this currency pair is shown in Figure 1 below. Evidently, I am early in
my trades as the recent upward momentum is still going. But that's just
speaking from hindsight advantage. What is actually wrong with this play
is that I was too eager at the first entry when the price was just at a
minor resistance (short-term trendline of Fig 1). In turn, that caused
me to lose my confidence and not be as aggressive as I should be when
the price reached a major resistance at 85.50. Referring to Fig. 1, I
made 5 attempts on the minor resistance below 84.60 in the first round.
What's worse is that I didn't have enough patience to wait after these
shorts failed and I tried again at 84.52. Even though that resistance
level is voided already. But here comes the kicker. I actually <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">noted
the important 85.50 level before my first attempt</a>. It was clearly on the chart and I even mentioned about its
significance. I just figured that it wouldn't be touched. How wrong I
was. As I said, another problem with being early in a trade is that it
stripe you of your confidence prematurely in a good setup. My setup to
short AUD/JPY is as good as ever now. I am drooling over that negative
RSI divergence shown in Fig. 1... But since I've already taken a beating
in this pair this week, my account drawdown dictates that I limit my
risk. As such, I can't back up the truck to pile in on this trade at
this point. But why not? I won't break one rule to compensate for
another. Although I am light in this trade now, I will not compromise my
risk management rules to compensate for my own mistakes. That would just
open a whole new can of worm. Besides, I can't say this often enough --
risk management is always the top priority in trading. In any case,
there will always be other opportunities. The moral of the story is
this. Do not be too eager to get into a trade. Secondly, adjust your
position size accordingly to the significance of the setup in play.</p>

an updated view of AUD/JPY a week later. The red dot on the 9th was my
last stopped out entry. As you can see, I missed the smooth 200 pips
ride down. This experience is proving to be better than I expected to
illustrate how being early in a trade can really hurt your account.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>In the unfortunate case that you are holding a massive losing position
in your portfolio and don't know what to do, the first step to fight
back is to reassess the situation with a rational, unbiased mind. Easier
said than done. But that is what I learned the hard way a few years back
when I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/emfp-the-trade-that-broke-me/">bankrupted my trading account in a single stock</a>. I waited for
weeks and then months. While checking online forums for discussions on
the stock, eager for others to fuel my hope. Hopes for the stock to come
back to some better price so that I can unload. 3 years later, the
company's stock price is still screeching along the zero mark. While I'd
like to think that I have come a long way since then, there is no
guarantee that I won't find myself in that situation again. As such, I
developed a self-assessment questionnaire with questions that needed to
be asked in a crisis. But often not because people are always too
emotionally caught up. It is like an emergency checklist for the
emergency. Here are my 10 questions to ask yourself when nothing is left
but false hope in a dire trading position:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is your current account drawdown compared to your previous
    performance?</li>
<li>How proven is your trading system?</li>
<li>Are your reasons for entering this position still valid?</li>
<li>Is the reason for letting the trade breakaway from you within your
    trading strategy?</li>
<li>What are the emotional reasons to hold this trade?</li>
<li>What are the logical reasons to hold this trade?</li>
<li>What are the emotional reasons to exit this trade?</li>
<li>What are the logical reasons to exit this trade?</li>
<li>What can you do to reduce your overall risk?</li>
<li>And last but not least, WHAT IF the price breaks against your trade
    even further?</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, once the crisis is over, it is time to reflect and review
what went wrong to prevent this from happening again. After all, at
least make something out of this by learning and improving. And if you
can, please share with us your learning experience in the comments below

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The rise in popularity of social sites for trading has paved the way for
ever more unscrupulous trading system sellers to spread their high yield
scams. Just to be clear, I am not against websites such as <a href="http://www.myfxbook.com">Myfxbook</a>
and <a href="http://www.covestor.com">Covestor</a>, nor against trading system sellers in general.
However, there are always bad apples in a basket. And there are many bad
apples out there. Trading social sites typically nurture a community of
traders by enforcing <strong>transparent</strong> and <strong>audited</strong> trading history.
Unfortunately, it is because of this claim, people are enticed by
trading systems showing unbelievable high yields of 200%, 400%, 800%, or
even more in mere weeks on sites such as Myfxbook or Covestor. But if
the history of every trade taken is published and the account is
verified, doesn't that mean that they are just really that good? First
of all, if these people can double or triple their accounts in a few
weeks or months as they claim, why the heck are they selling their
system to you for a few hundred bucks and lose their monopoly?! If you
have a Lamborghini in your garage, do you rent it out for a few hundred
bucks to total strangers? Common sense should be on red alert. For sake
of argument, let's say that you give them the benefit of the doubt. All
is not as simple as it seems though. Here is one old trick in the book
scammers may use to game a transparent and audited trade history. I will
use <a href="http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Pheniox/sir-lancelot/1806">one of the top performers currently on Myfxbook</a> to illustrate
how their scam work. And surprise, surprise, this particular system is
on sale for a limited time (will see why later) for only US\$365. Figure
1 is the account percentage growth graph of this particular system. 488%
gain in 4 months!</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Account growth
chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_balancecurve.png" />][][/caption] Let's take a look at the trading performance
statistics. Remember, these are <strong>real, audited numbers</strong>.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Trade
performance statistics"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradestats.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradestats.png">1</a>[/caption] Aside from the impressive
90% success rate (something <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-goldman-sachs-robbed-you-and-me-of-3-billions-in-3-months/">only Goldman Sachs can achieve</a>
consistently), the rest of the numbers actually look quite normal.
Notice that their average pips won and lost are both around 13 pips. So
this is supposedly a short-term scalping strategy to catch small but
high probability moves. Which does exist in real life, as you know. Then
as if you're not convinced of their awesomeness yet, here's a snapshot
of some recent trade history.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Trade
history"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradehist.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_tradehist.png">2</a>[/caption] This is where you might start to raise
some eyebrows. Observe that 5 out of 8 trades shown are minuscule gains
but they have <strong>no stop loss</strong> in place! That's not a problem, per se.
Some systems don't use an open stop order. However, notice the open and
closing time. These suspicious trades were held for almost a day! That's
like an eternity for a scalping system. Who knows how much drawdown have
occurred in the account during those hours! Actually, we do, take a look
at the figure below for an open order of this system.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Open
trade"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_opentrades.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/SLS-Myfxbook_opentrades.png">3</a>[/caption] Caught red-handed! The open order shows a
gigantic loss running. See the -\$9290 loss being held? That's about a
third of their current balance of \$29k! But here's the trick. What the
system does is wait for market noise to swing the price back to
breakeven and then close the trade for a +1 pip. As the trade isn't
closed at the moment, this humongous drawdown doesn't count as a loss
and is nowhere to be seen in the trading history. That is what happens
with many of those unusually small pips but long-held trades as
discussed above. In effect, they are risking their entire account
balance on just a few pips of profit on every trade. The reason why many
of these unbelieveable systems typically have a trade history of only a
few months at most? That isn't just for show. Sooner or later, their
luck runs out with this no-stop rule and the market will have them choke
down those monstrous losses. Eventually, their account just blows up.
But at that point, they can make a switch-aroo and pull up another
trading history that hasn't blown up yet to replace this one that just
failed. Then it's business as usual. What's more amusing is thatsomeone
asked this question of why there is a huge drawdown in another huge
drawdown open trade months ago. The response from the author is that it
was just a careless programming mistake. Imagine, here they are selling
a massively "profitable" system on one hand and then claiming a glitch
on another. In summary, <strong>the key to a statistically 100% winning
system</strong> is simple. Follow the trend with no stop and only close a trade
with a positive gain. But as I've explained the fallacies with this
approach above, <strong>never try that with your money</strong> as you are risking
all for so little! For general advice on avoiding forex scams, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex_scam">Wikipedia entry</a> offers an overview and ForexCrunch has a good
article on <a href="http://www.forexcrunch.com/forex-scams-7-ways-to-avoid-them/">7 Ways to Avoid Forex Scams</a>.</p>
