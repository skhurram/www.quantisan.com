            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>One of my trading shortcomings which I've lamented is the lack of an
automated method to pick and choose which stocks to play. I've
experimented with Yahoo's free stock screener a while ago but find that
the heavy dependence on basic statistics impractical. I've also
considered using <a href="http://www.stockfetcher.com/">StockFetcher.com</a> but don't like the use of
indicators as they are typically after-the-fact.</p>
<p>Today, I've learned through <a href="http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/09/nice-tool-for-identifying-stocks-in.html">TraderFeed</a> of <a href="http://www.finviz.com/screener.ashx">FinViz's stock
screener</a> tool. In particular, the tool has the option to filter out
stocks based on earnings release date. As day traders know, finding the
right stocks to play is a big step in the game. Stocks nearing earnings
release are generally a lot more active in terms of both price and
volume levels. Simply put, we can use FinViz's screener to find stocks
that will release their earnings soon so short term interest in the
stock will be high. Thus, more opportunities can arise.</p>
<p>Using this method should yield 10 to 20 stocks to analyse on a daily
basis for short term plays. The next step would be to apply your own
trading strategy in finding the best setups to play.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-cbrl-breakout-before-earnings/">CBRL is my first test candidate</a> from using this tool.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I was just reading <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/18/090518fa_fact_lehrer">this article in The New Yorker</a> and I am impressed
by it so much so that I'd like to log this in my trading journal.</p>
<p>The article is about a simple study done in the 60's with hundreds of
kids being asked to resist the temptation to a table-full of candies
while waiting for the researcher to come back into the room. Years
later, the researcher find that those that is able to delay instant
gratification are more successful later in life.</p>
<p>I've read about this study before, but this article is a lot more
comprehensive than what I've seen. Anyway, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/18/090518fa_fact_lehrer">read the article</a> for the details.</p>
<p>
So what's so special about having self-control? The article and the
researcher puts it poignantly.

> For decades, psychologists have focussed on raw intelligence as the
> most important variable when it comes to predicting success in life.
> Mischel argues that intelligence is largely at the mercy of
> self-control: even the smartest kids still need to do their homework.
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re really measuring with the
> marshmallows isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t will power or
> self-control,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â? Mischel says.
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s much more important than that.
> This task forces kids to find a way to make the situation work for
> them. They want the second marshmallow, but how can they get it? We
> canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t control the world, but we can control how we
> think about it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â?

And how are some of these 4-year-old doing it?

> At the time, psychologists assumed that childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s
> ability to wait depended on how badly they wanted the marshmallow. But
> it soon became obvious that every child craved the extra treat. What,
> then, determined self-control? MischelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s conclusion,
> based on hundreds of hours of observation, was that the crucial skill
> was the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstrategic allocation of
> attention.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â? Instead of getting obsessed with the
> marshmallowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â?the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhot
> stimulusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â?the patient children
> distracted themselves by covering their eyes, pretending to play
> hide-and-seek underneath the desk, or singing songs from
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSesame Street.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â? Their desire
> wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t defeatedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â?it was merely
> forgotten. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re thinking about
> the marshmallow and how delicious it is, then youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re
> going to eat it,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â? Mischel says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe key
> is to avoid thinking about it in the first place.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â?

So what does this have to do with trading?

> In adults, this skill is often referred to as **metacognition**, or
> thinking about thinking, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what allows people
> to outsmart their shortcomings. (When Odysseus had himself tied to the
> shipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mast, he was using some of the skills of
> metacognition: knowing he wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be able to resist
> the SirensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ song, he made it impossible to give in.)
> MischelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s large data set from various studies allowed
> him to see that children with a more accurate understanding of the
> workings of self-control were better able to delay gratification.
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interesting about
> four-year-olds is that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just figuring out
> **the rules of thinking**,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â? Mischel says.
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe kids who couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t delay would
> often have the rules backwards. They would think that the best way to
> resist the marshmallow is to stare right at it, to keep a close eye on
> the goal. But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a terrible idea. If you do that,
> youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to ring the bell before I leave the
> room.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â?

In other words, we need to identify our psychological issues in trading
and react to them before they destroy our accounts! One way I'm doing
this now is using [a set of clear and objective rules][].

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-31-srs-4808/">SRS position is deep underwater</a>. To add to the mistake, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-srs-100-may-09-35-put-610/">added
to it last Thursday in a hurry</a> hoping for a rebound from a massive
selloff to a new 52-week low. Even though the chart looked like it was
testing support last Thursday, I <strong>should have waited for a rebound
before entering</strong>. And second, <strong>if I don't even have the time to write
my trade log, I should never enter a trade</strong>.</p>
<p>This is definitely a wakeup call to rectify my tendency of entering too
early in the short term. I have since mentally walked through what I
should have done and have come up with a simple entry strategy that I
will follow from now on. Basically, I will wait validation of a intraday
low and then enter only if it passes its intraday resistance. Then I
will set a hard stop just below a recent support. This will no doubt
create a lot more stopped out trades, but it's up to me to find high
probability trades. All it needs now is some verification...</p>
<p>In any case, I clearly need to spend less time trading and more time
developing my skills and strategies.</p>
<p>Back to the positions at hand. From Figure 1, SRS is at the bottom of a
long term down trend. Stop is \$30. Target is \$41. From the look of it,
SRS will be going down even further if the market can hold its ground
above 850. However, if the market fails to climb up, then yesterday's
slightly higher low than Monday is a small plus point for SRS.</p>
<p>Update: Interestingly, in today's news <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123979197193420547.html">U.S. Foreclosures Jumped in
March</a> and General Growth Files For Bankruptcy: Report. The 2nd news
came in the middle of the night. And it's nowhere to be found unless you
really look for it. I only read about it from <a href="http://caracommunity.com/content/caras-commentary-community-chat-thurs-apr-16-2009">CaraCommunity</a>. For one
of the largest REIT to declare bankruptcy, you'd think it'd be all over
the news. Doesn't take a genious to figure this incident is deliberately
hidden.</p>

<p>My USO position is faring better, although it's merely hovering above
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-175/">my entry price</a>. Now that the <a href="http://shockedinvestor.blogspot.com/2009/04/uso-rollover-report-for-april.html">April roll over of USO</a> is complete,
the downward pressure on USO should be gone. Even during the roll over,
USO has managed to remain above its upward trendline. This is definitely
a big plus.</p>
<p>New stop is \$28.80 and conservative target is \$32.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Yes, I'm still holding on to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-31-srs-4808/">SRS from yesterday</a>. I'm down
\$10/share at the close today. However, we are just testing a long term
support line here. Furthermore, the market is only up about 1% today
whereas SRS tanked 17.58%. This is definitely capitulation of SRS we're
seeing now. The question I ask myself is, would I be buying at this
level? Given the above two reasons, the answer is yes. Yet, I would
definitely ditch it early next week if there's continued weakness for
SRS.</p>
<p>My biggest mistake for this trade is entering too early. Note to self,
<strong>wait for a bounce from support before entering and set a hard stop
just below it</strong>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Once again, I find myself on the other side of the fence. I entered a
short at 10:42am today thinking the gap up is unsustainable. Well, not
only has S&amp;P500 broken 800, it's now resting above 820. Goldman Sachs
(GS) was about 106.50 when I entered the short. GS closed at 111.93
today. I'm down \$210 already. If GS can stay above this 200 day MA at
\$110 later tomorrow, then I'm out.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1125" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="S&amp;P 500 ETF"]<img alt="S&amp;P 500 ETF" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/2009-03-23-spy.png" title="2009-03-23-spy" />[/caption]</p>

<p>As you can see, GS went vertical upward once it broke the morning
resistance at \$17.30. The reason for my entry in the morning was
because GS seemed like it was having difficulty breaking \$17.
Furthermore, S&amp;P 500 also seemed hesitant around 800. So I guessed it'd
be reasonable to see a pullback.</p>
<p>However, I failed to take into account today's humongous gap up open. It
would have been counter-productive if we're to close the gap on the
weekend's hype up. This is pretty much a reverse of what we've seen
seeing for the past few months. Panic begets panic. But in today's case,
it's panic of missing the rally train that'll fuel this possibly new leg
of a rally.</p>
<p>My second mistake is trading on lack of information. I traded using the
mobile platform and by just looking at the Google Finance charts. If I
had access to my intraday sentiment chart, I could have easily seen that
the morning momentum remained strong even when S&amp;P was stalling around
800.</p>
<p>Lastly, I really should stick to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/market%20analysis/">my own analysis</a> and not trade on a
spontaneous urge. I did say in the morning that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/beginning-of-another-bull-phase-asian-markets-are-on-fire/">we'll break down if we
fail to maintain 800</a>. Even at the time of my short entry, we were
indeed holding on to the 800 zone. Thus, I have basically shot myself in
the foot for not listening to myself.</p> </div>

White House holds off on auto bailout.</p>
<p>Since I'm no economist, I am not going to discuss about the auto bailout
here. What matters to me is the market. As I was saying, the market
gapped down Friday morning and even touched 851 in the first few
minutes. However, it hacked its way back up to close positive at 879.73.</p>
<p>We managed to hold this critical 850 support level as I noted in
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/post-market-analysis-december-11-2008/">Thursday's post-market analysis</a>. However, I wouldn't want to add to
the longs at this point because both of my uptrend channels have been
broken. I feel that at this point, it is safer to watch and be more late
into a trend than usual.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to see the S&amp;P 500's behaviour around 860 or
900 (Figure 2), which ever comes first, before adding to my existing

<p>On a more personal note, my stops for DRYS and SKF were triggered on
Friday.</p>
<p>On December 12, 2008 8:30:32 AM, my -\$1.0 trailing stop for DRYS were
triggered (stop at \$7.90) and my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-200-drys-533/">last 100 shares</a> were sold for a
basement price of \$7.34. I have definitely been a victim by the market
makers gunning for stops. As DRYS pushed higher throughout the day and
closed at \$9.37 on Friday.</p>
<p>As I'm actually away on a trip for these few weeks, I don't think I'll
re-enter DRYS until it clears the resistance at \$12. I simply cannot
watch it as close as I would like.</p>
<p>In any case, I already unloaded half my position <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-drys-111103/">previously at
\$11.11</a>. So although I feel I've been ripped off with my stop, I
believe this is overall still a good trade because I unloaded on
strength and have set a reasonable (using my channel) stop just in case
it turns back down on me while I'm away.</p>

<p>My Ultrashort Financials (SKF) stop was triggered on Friday too. This
one I am a little dumbfounded. I have set my trailing stop at -\$17 on
the mark for SKF. The stop price of \$124 was triggered and my 7 shares
were sold for \$124.09. Having <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-7-skf-12883/">bought at \$128.83 the previous day</a>,
this is a small loss.</p>
<p>Notice that giant opening spike in the chart below? This is yet another
example of the market makers gunning for the stops. I believe I should
have set a hard stop instead for this one since I'm using it as a hedge.</p>

<p>This is still a trader's market. Since I'm away oversea, I can't manage
my account as effective as I would have liked. Setting the trailing
stops was a safety measure. Although they worked against me this time, I
still think it was a good decision given my circumstances.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am at 50% longs now with no hedge (not good). My other 50% is
in cash. My primary short term goal now is to seek out a good short
entry to hedge my longs. I don't think I have the guts to add anymore
longs until I see more strength in this rally.</p> </div>
