            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>It is that time of the month again when I do my trading performance
review. However, I did not make any trade this month. Not because I was
procrastinating, but I spent all of my time this month to work on my
quantitative projects. This review will be a recap of my backend trading
development. I said in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/february-2010-trading-performance-review/">last month's performance review</a> that my
goal for March is "to write a rudimentary data analysis and
visualization program for historical forex data." Well, I finished <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/data-scraping-the-toronto-stock-exchange-extracting-3660-companies-data/">half
of it</a> and then realized that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/from-object-oriented-programming-to-object-oriented-design/">I need a better design for the
software</a>. So I studied yet another programming book (finished 3
programming books this month), on object oriented design and analysis.
The other major event for me this month is that I finally opened a
self-directed RRSP account at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> because the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/considering-investment-options-for-my-first-rrsp/">tax benefit is
too good to pass</a>. Consequently, I am starting to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-first-analysis-of-the-sptsx-60-index/">study the Canadian
stock market</a> for trading with a conservative, intermediate-term
manner (not buy and hold though). Lastly, it seems that I might be back
to trading forex sooner than I have thought. I signed up for an
automated trading contest at <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143">Dukascopy</a> earlier this week. Since they
are offering a cash prize, I thought I might as well reschedule and work
on my forex stuff now. I will write more on this topic at another time.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If the idea of handing your RRSP contributions over to a sales person
(a.k.a. financial advisor) at a bank isn't appealing to you, then it is
time to consider your investment choices. I am about to contribute for
the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/considering-investment-options-for-my-first-rrsp/">first time ever into my RRSP</a> this year. So I performed my due
diligence by researching and evaluating my choices. This post is a
ranking of my findings. I evaluate each investment strategy according to
three criterias, in descending order of importance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk</strong>. Will I lose sleep at night if I put all my money in it?</li>
<li><strong>Reward</strong>. How much can I potentially gain?</li>
<li><strong>Effort</strong>. How much time and energy do I need to spend on it?</li>
</ul>
<p>My overall portfolio is exposed to enough risk already from my other
trading activities. So my risk appetite is leaning towards a
conservative approach. Also note that I factor in costs as a part of my
risk assessment. I place a 40% emphasis on this criteria. Next, I
consider the return of each investment vehicle using a 40% weight. For
obvious reasons. Lastly, I prefer something that requires as little time
and effort as possible. I weight this criteria at 20%. As I've said
numerous times, I don't like the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/">limitations in a registered
account</a>. It is like trying to invest with one hand tied behind my
back. I do not want to put much effort to manage this account because I
can do better in my regular trading. The resulting ranking of the six
types of markets <em>that I am considering</em> for my RRSP (and TFSA) is as
follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Guaranteed savings</li>
<li>Indices or sectors (through passive mutual funds or ETF's)</li>
<li>Fixed income (using a mutual fund or ETF bond index)</li>
<li>Gold</li>
<li>Stocks</li>
<li>Actively managed mutual funds</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing of note about investing in physical gold within a registered
account is that it can only be done at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> as far as I know.
Although I doubt they are the only one. Here is the table I used to
estimate this ranking. I give each category a score from 1 (bad) to 5
(good) based on my own experience and my sentiment of future market
condition. So yes, it is a very crude guess at best. Nevertheless, the
table shows that my best choice is to either put my RRSP money in a
savings account or invest in indices using passive mutual funds (like
the TD e-Series) or ETF's. However, I plan to do both. I will trade
indices in my RRSP and put my TFSA money in a high yield savings
account. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="493" caption="RRSP

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>A benefit of having traded different markets and instruments is that I
have gained different perspectives on the capital markets. I realize
that all markets are ultimately related. Rather it is fundamental,
technical, or quantitative analysis, traders are essentially analyzing
the supply and demand of the instrument that they are trading. But
supply and demand is influenced solely by money flow in the capital
markets. As such, it is the dynamics of money flow that drives the
movement of something as big as EUR/USD or as small as a penny stock.
Secondly, money do not appear out of thin air or do they evaporate.
Money moving out of one thing end up somewhere else, and vice versa.
Consider a dollar in your wallet. Where does it come from? Where will it
go? You probably have a good idea of that yourself. Similarly, money
moving in and out of a stock comes from somewhere and go somewhere too.
That somewhere can be as close as the next stock in that same exchange.
Or, it can be moved to another market (e.g. bonds or commodities)
entirely. This happens more often than I used to think because this is
how the institutions and the pros play. They don't limit themselves to
any particular exchange or any market. They simply go where the money
is. As you can see through this simplistic mental exercise,</p>
<ol>
<li>money flow is the only driver of prices</li>
<li>money has to come from somewhere and go somewhere</li>
</ol>
<p>That is the reason why I say all markets are related. It is also the
reason why even if you trade a local or a specialized market, it is
essential that you are at least aware of what's happening around. Not
doing so is just willingly ignoring a large part of valuable data. Bill
Cara has a saying that "markets do not operate in a vacuum". In his
<a href="http://caracommunity.com/content/week-review-11-2010-2">weekly review on March 14, 2010</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global equity markets do not trade in a vacuum. It is important to be
watching these markets move through a trend juncture together, pushed
and pulled by global currency and commodity strength or weakness as
well as local and regional economic forces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like to visualize the capital markets (stocks, commodities, forex,
etc.) as an interconnected web. Granted, some points are connected more
than others. But push or pull on any point and you can see the effect
throughout the web. One practical use of this concept in trading is that
if one market is moving up or down, you can observe its impact on the
global financial web to estimate (using historical patterns or some
blackbox model) will that move pick up momentum or will it retrace back
to where it was. This is the essence of intermarket analysis.</p>
