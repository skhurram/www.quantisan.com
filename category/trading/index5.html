            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I recently talked about the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/">benefits of a Questrade TFSA trading
account</a>. In this series of posts, I will take the other side of the
debate. That is, to answer this simple question, with a \$5,000 initial
deposit, is a TFSA trading account a cost effective means to allocate
your asset? <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-2/">Part 2</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-3/">Part 3</a> of this series discuss my
derivation of a spreadsheet to do the job. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-4/">Part 4</a> is the conclusion
along with a free interactive spreadsheet that I made so that you can
get your own results with a few keystrokes. The first step in any
trading or investing is to consider your costs. After all, trading is a
business and your bottom line is well... your bottom line (cue eye
rolls). Every penny added to your costs means that you'll just have to
perform that much better to overcome it. Easier said than done. As such,
here is my cost analysis in response to my previous post about the
Questrade TFSA trading account, in particular. Feel free to use this as
a guideline for your own cost analysis if you're considering <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">opening a
Questrade TFSA trading account</a> (affiliate link) yourself. We each
have our own unique financial picture so this cost analysis is merely a
peek from my personal perspective. Here goes my calculations and
rationales. The minimal commission on stock trades is \$5 at Questrade.
A \$5 commission may not seem much to most people. But consider this.
For a \$5000 account, \$5 is 0.1%. On a basic single-lot round-trip (buy
and then sell, all shares at once) trade, the total commission is \$5 x
2 = \$10. Thus, I will be 0.2% behind in my account on each and every
trade! Yes, 0.2% is a small number. However, take a look at my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trading
log</a> from my recent <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex trades</a> and you'll see that I made more
than 10% in 4 months by taking 0.2% here and 0.3% there. In fact, if we
consider the statistics from<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/october-2009-trading-performance-review/">my best forex trading month last year</a>,
my average net profit percentage per trade is 0.12%. I totalled 4.19%
net profit on that particular month by raking in a lot of those +0.12%
trades. As you can see, a 0.2% commission would effectively break my
profitable system. So conclusion #1. I cannot trade my TFSA with the
same <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy</a> as my forex trading. In other words, no
aggressive day and swing trading. In my next post in this cost analysis
series, I will see if I can find an <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-2/">cost optimal risk amount to use per
trade</a> in a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade TFSA trading account</a>. And if I can't justify it, well, bye bye TFSA
trading!</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>It seems to me that the popular trading blogs have one thing in common.
They all make some form of forecasts about the market, or even better,
calling out to a particular stock or currency pair. My guess is that
there's a lot more people looking for trading ideas for quick profits
than actually interested in the mundane mechanics of trading. Well, that
and because of the fact that some of these blogs are written by
respectable professionals that do provide good insights (my
recommendations are linked to in my blogroll, near bottom of the sidebar
to the right). I used to publish my predictions on the market on a
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/weekly-review/">frequent basis</a>. It was my way of taking notes and keeping record for
the week or month. Ever since my embarrassing, and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-errors-lessons-being-long-just-before-the-october-2008-crash/">costly</a>, attempt
to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-sign-this-financial-bloodbath-is-ending-soon/">call for the bottom in October 2008,</a> I have learned to keep my
views to myself for the following reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>I suck at forecasting, terribly.</li>
<li>I wouldn't want anyone to trade on my guesses.</li>
<li>There are plenty of other, much wiser, traders posting their views
    online.</li>
<li>I changed my strategy by trading on reactions and not predictions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point #4 is what I'd like to discuss in this post. The main problem I
have with making forecasts is that I get stuck to one perspective. Say
if after a weekend analyzing session, I conclude that the market is up
for next week. I would keep looking for opportunities to go long in the
market the following week. That works well if I am right. Yet, as I
always say, I am wrong just as often as anyone. So the chance of success
is at best 50-50. On an equal chance that if I am wrong. I lose not once
but twice. First from being in the wrong side of the price move. Second
from missing that opposite and correct move. As such, I have since
adapted to a reactive <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy</a> rather than a predictive one.
Essentially, I analyze the markets to come up with conditions for
different scenarios (usually just three cases: up, down, and no idea)
that will play out. For example, if <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-gbpjpy-145-24-stop-144-70-target-148/">GBP/JPY is above 144.50, I go
long</a>. One of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">trading skills</a> I am still struggling to execute
consistently is to be deliberately one step slower than most people on
entering a trade. Being reactive is simplistically being a step slower
than everyone to ride an obvious setup. It goes like this ideally. When
the writings are on the wall and more aggressive traders have taken
their position, I wait even more. Then once those trades are still left
standing (i.e. not stopped out), that's when I would strike. On the
other hand, if the signs are not clear as crystal, I need to have the
discipline to step to the sideline. This strategy has been very useful
to me as I have recorded some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">good trades</a> because of it. My ideal
strategy certainly is less glamourous than a buy low, sell high motto.
Yet, having been through a few too many ups and downs in my account over
the years, I have learned to appreciate the art of not gunning for every
penny out there but aiming to keep every penny in my pocket. Much like
how you would survive in a battle, the secret is to not be the first one
out the line and then only go for the easy kills. Cowardly, yes. But
unlike war, being brave in trading does not earn you any medal.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
Tales of great traders like Jesse Livermore, Paul Tudor Jones, or George
Soros are inspirational. But there may come a time when a trader look at
their trading performance over the years and say to themselves, "Why am
I wasting my time with these average returns? I could never be like
them!" For amateur traders such as myself that hasn't "made it yet" but
haven't gone bankrupt yet either, finding the energy to grind this out
year after year is not a trivial task. I have attempted to answer this
question myself in my [About page][]. Then last week, I came across a
quote by an Olympic athlete whom has said it more succinctly than ever.
Here's what she said.

> "I look back, I used to think I was really good but I wasn't. That's
> okay. Everyone has a different path. Some people are really good when
> they're young. Some people aren't. If you like it and you want to keep
> doing it, just do it." [Kristina Groves][], Canadian speedskater

If you like it and you want to keep doing it, just do it. Like an
athlete that finishes last in the line or an artist without a clientele,
I am trading because this is what I love doing. It doesn't matter to me
if I am not wheeling cash to the bank yet. As long as I'm not doing more
harm than good to my bank account, I will continue trading. Simply
because this is what I love doing. Source: *thestar.com* -- Kristina
Groves: Big heart, big results

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Sometimes, things in life will get in the way of your trading. From down
with a cold to your internet service provider acting up, there are times
when your are not able to trade in your ideal zone. What do you do in
these disadvantaged circumstances? Do you take some NyQuil or whip out
your Blackberry, and then continue trading? This decision certainly
depends on the severity of your handicap and your trading
responsibility. If you have a massive open position with no stop, you'd
better suck it up and do something about it quick. For amateurs such as
myself with nobody to answer to but my own account, I would scale out of
my positions and then stop trading to focus on fixing my obstacle. I am
faced with this question recently and here's what I'm doing about it. I
have been practicing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> forex for the past few months
working out some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading signals</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">strategies</a> before going
live. During this time, I have become very fond of the 3-hour chart. My
strategy essentially boils down to making high-level decisions on the
weekly and daily charts, then executing my trades on the 3-hour and
1-hour charts. I've written specifically about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">my basic setup</a> and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">how I scale into a trade on the 3-hour timeframe</a>. This latter
technique, along with managing my stops, are the basis of my risk
management. So imagine the disruption to my perfect world when I was
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/barred-from-trading-at-work-a-curse-or-a-gift/">barred from trading at my day job</a> last month. The first step I took
is to adapt my trading strategy. I tried trading a longer timeframe so
that I don't have to move my orders every few hours. But the inability
to limit my risks is really getting to me. That was the best part of my
trading system and now I can't use it anymore. This is one big hole into
my trading strategy. So rather than continue on trading with a handicap,
I've decided to cast my trading aside to focus on remedying this problem
as soon as possible. Here are my 2 reasons for it.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are always opportunities in the market.</li>
<li>There is no handicap system in trading.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since my best trading system is effectively broken at this point, I
cannot perform as well as I should. Rather than compete with the rest of
the world in a handicapped state, it's better for me to ease back on
trading to put my effort to fixing my shortcomings. The longer I delay,
the more my demo account would be unnecessary exposed. In fact,
continuing to trade full force with a handicap would just be reckless
and arrogant. I am <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">just scrapping by</a> when I'm well. I can't imagine
how deep my drawdown would be if I trade without my best technique. Here
is my trading plan for the next few weeks. I will trade another strategy
using a longer timeframe. I will limit my risks and focus by holding at
most 2 positions at a time with maximum of 0.2% of account at risk for
each. The majority (about 70%) of my usual trading time will be spent on
learning <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/MQL4/">MQL 4</a> and developing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated risk management systems</a>.
That's the story of my problem and solution. What do you do when life
gets in your way of trading?</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>2010 didn't begin well for me. I experienced my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/first-2010-trading-drawdown-analysis-on-the-verge-of-a-new-record/">biggest drawdown</a> so
far at -3.95% (see Figure 1 for my account balance graph) in my demo
account. Given that I only risk 0.2% per trade, this is a relatively
substantial setback. Ironically, I was in the process of filling paper
work to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">open a live account</a> when this performance setback hit me.
Change of plan. Now I'll have to postpone live trading until I can at
least recover my demo account balance. To do that, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/work-harder-trade-fewer-in-a-long-and-excruciating-trading-drawdown/">tightened up</a> my
risk exposure and focused on playing only <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">my best setup</a>. By the
close of the month, my demo account is sitting at -1.2% for January. At
least I have made it some way from the bottom with a few <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">good
trades</a>. This is also the first negative month for me since beginning
trading forex in September, just 4 months ago.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="January 2010
Demo Account Balance"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/january_2010_account_balance.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Aside from my performance, a notable change this month for my trading is
the fact that I've been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/barred-from-trading-at-work-a-curse-or-a-gift/">barred from trading during the day</a>. This
forced me to trade less, which is a good thing. On the other hand, I'm
not able to manage my stops as often as I would have liked. As such,
I've been helpless at times and watched some profitable positions <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-gbpjpy-144-24-stop-143-60-target-148/">turn
sour</a>. Whereas before, I would have at least moved my stops to
breakeven when the price moved away enough. Obviously, this calls for a
drastic change to my current trading strategy. For one, I'm looking at
higher timeframes for my trading now to catch slower moves. Secondly, my
top priority for the next few months is to develop some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">trading bots</a>
to manage my risks while I'm away.</p>

<h2>Goal for February</h2>
<p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/december-2009-trading-performance-review/">goal from the previous month</a> is to think more and trade less.
Well, I managed the latter part but the former still requires work as
evident by my negative return this month. For February, my strategy is
to keep trading with half the risk exposure (i.e. 0.1% per trade) to
recover my account back to its all-time high in beginning of January.
I'm just about 2% away at this moment. My goal for February is to get
acquinted with MQL4 so that I can begin to develop expert advisors to
manage my risks during the day and overnight.</p>

the longest time, I've traded <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/stocks/">stocks</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/options/">options</a>, and even dabbled
in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures</a> (not while at work!). On a whim in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2009/09/">September 2009</a>, I
decided to try out the foreign exchange markets with a demo account just
to see what the fuzz is about. Since then I have not looked back... Nah!
But no, trading stocks still remain my main staple. I am just curious
about forex and it never hurts to broaden my understanding of the
capital market. I must admit though, forex suits my trading style. I
fully intend to incorporate it in my portfolio in the long run. So what
is my plan about forex trading? What do I want to achieve with my
obsessive <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> lately? My paper trading objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">trading weaknesses</a></li>
<li>Identify my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">strengths</a></li>
<li>Experiment with various <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading signals</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">strategies</a></li>
<li>Get a <em>feel</em> of trading the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex market</a></li>
<li>Understand the dynamics between currencies</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd be a fool to claim that I have achieved my objectives. Trading is a
never-ending learning process. This is nothing but the first stage in my
forex trading sojourn. The next stage now, as I have intended from the
beginning, is to automate some trading processes from what I've learned.
Such that I can remain active in the markets even when I am not around.
Not for more profits, but to reduce risks. This need became blatantly
obvious to me as some of my positions were left running through Asia and
early Europe. Profits were sometimes turned into losses. If only my
stops were moved. Fortunately, the vigorous paper trading in the past
few months does have its advantage. It has given me ideas for 3 new
trading systems. I have disclosed one concept with my post on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC
setup</a>. As I was saying, being blocked from trading at work merely
pushes my agenda forward. I haven't touched a single line of code for 5
months. Now I have no choice but to work on developing some
semi-<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading systems</a> to continue my forex paper trading.
My ultimate goal is to let myself do the high-level decision making,
such as which pair to trade, which side of the position, and when. Then
let loose a simple algorithmic trading system to take care of the timing
for entries and exits, and some basic <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex
trading</a> life continues.</p>
