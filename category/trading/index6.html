            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I barely traded this month. The total number of trades in February for
my forex demo account is ten. That's far from my regular 150 - 250
trades a month. Ever since my trading system was broken because of
technical difficulties, I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-to-do-when-life-gets-in-your-way-of-trading/">changed my priorities</a> in trading. I
spent most of my time in February learning a new programming language to
ramp up my quant and automated trading projects. I also tried a few
longer term trades this month. The results haven't been uplifting. I am
about breakeven by the end of the month with a net gain of .... \$2 in a
\$5550 demo account. As you can see, there's really not much point in me
continuing paper trading at this stage. It is taking valuable time away
from me to fix what's broken so that I can use my previously profitable
trading system again. As such, I'm going to put near 100% of my effort
to program a semi-automated trading system for the coming weeks, or
probably months. On another note. Seeing that it is tax season here in
Canada. I thought about my tax situation and considered <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">opening a
Questrade TFSA trading account</a> (affiliate link) to legitimately
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/">avoid income taxes from trading</a>. But after considering the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">cost and
benefit</a> of such a move, I concluded that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-4/">a TFSA trading account
isn't cost effective for me</a> at the moment. As I've spent most of the
month doing backend work, there isn't very much to review for my trading
this month. So let's just dive right into my statistics for the record.</p>
<h2>Performance Statistics</h2>
<p><strong>Monthly Metric February (January)</strong> Sarting Fund \$5,550.02 End of
Month Fund \$5,551.99 Total Net Profit \$1.97 (-\$67.42) Gross Profit

know as it's useful to calculate my statistical return expectancy as

<h2>Goal for March</h2>
<p>My goal from January is <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">to learn MQL4</a>. I changed my plan since then
due <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">my lack of faith with using a proprietary scripting language</a>. I
learned Python programming this month and is now learning to use
specialized libraries to serve my trading needs. My goal for March is to
write a rudimentary data analysis and visualization program for
historical forex data.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Alright, so I'm <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-first-food-poisoning-experience/">back from the dead</a>. Let's finish this cost-benefit
analysis before the weekend. Here are back links for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-2/">Part
2</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-3/">Part 3</a> in case you missed them. The table below shows my
expected return as derived through part 2 and part 3 of this series. As
you can see, I'm only expected to break-even by risking 1% of my \$5000
TFSA trading account. Trading just for the sake of break-even isn't
exactly an enviable goal. Based on my statistics, I typically say an
expected return of 0.10% per trade is acceptable. Looking at the table,
that would require that I risk 1.5% per trade. [caption id=""
align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TFSA Trading Cost-Benefit for
Reward/Risk = 2.0 and 40% win rate"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/TFSA_trading_cost-benefit_analysis.png" />][][/caption] So I'll have to
risk 1.5% just to scrape in 0.10% of profit? The problem is obvious.
Using a \$5000 trading account with \$5 commission, along with my
historical trading performance simply do not justify the odds. I started
this series to study the cost effectiveness of a Questrade TFSA trading
account. But the conclusion which I derived is much broader. Considering
that even without being taxed, a \$5000 TFSA trading account is
insufficient for trading with a commission of \$5 or higher. Thus, if
this is a taxed, non-registered trading account, the cost would be even
more. As such, not only is \$5000 an insufficient capital for a
Questrade TFSA trading account; \$5000 is simply too little money to
trade any trading account with \$5 of commission per trade for me.
Remember though, this cost-benefit analysis is based on my own
statistics. You can input your own parameters into <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AnZW_RfDqK11dG5jVzUwbDIxWEQ5aFV3cjVRdU5BbFE&amp;hl=en">this spreadsheet</a>
to get <strong>your own set of results</strong>. To be fair, I must clarify that the
problem isn't with Questrade. Even with their <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">lowest trading commission
in Canada</a> (affiliate link), a \$5 trading commission for an account
of \$5000 is simply too much for me. Yes, there's nothing to stop you
from trading with a \$5 commission for a \$5000 account. Heck, many have
claimed to be successful with less than \$5000. However, that's just not
my style. I don't gamble with my hard earned money. I only trade when
the odds are in my favour. If the cost is un-proportionately high, it's
as if I've suffered a setback even before I begin fighting the battle.
As such, I'm going to say "no thanks!" to a Questrade TFSA trading
account for now. My short term plan is to look for a guaranteed TFSA
savings account until I can develop a trading system for Canadian stocks
that would justify the cost-benefit.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>This post continue on the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-2/">calculations from part 2</a> of this TFSA
trading cost analysis series. Part 1 is an <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">introduction outlining the
rationale</a> for this work. Let's pick up where we left off. I was just
about to figure out what is my <em>expected profit</em> using probability
theory. To do that, I use my historical performance data to calculate my
probability of profitable trades. I've been calculating my trading
statistics in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/monthly-review/">monthly reviews</a>, so it's just a matter of
aggregating all the monthly data to a single number. After a few
keystrokes, I find that my win/loss percentages are roughly 40%/60%.
Given my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-2/">known reward/risk ratio</a> (discussed in part 2) and
probability of win (40% as noted above), we can calculate a net return
expectancy. This is a simple formula if you know statistics and
confusing if you don't. So I'll just write it out as is but do refer to
the Wikipedia on<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">statistical expectancy</a> if you'd like to know more
about how I derived this. Expected net return per trade = (Average
Reward from Step 1 - Commission) * (Probability of Win from Step 2) -
[(Risked Amount + Commission) * (1 - Probability of Win)] This formula
is the result we seek. We apply the forumula to extend the cost-benefit
table presented last time. Here's a complete cost-benefit table using
the parameters of a \$5000 principal balance, \$5 commission, capital
gain tax of 17.5% (half of marginal tax rate), reward/win ratio of 2.0,
and a 40% winning rate. It likely that you'll have different parameters
than me. So I am <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AnZW_RfDqK11dG5jVzUwbDIxWEQ5aFV3cjVRdU5BbFE&amp;hl=en">sharing my spreadsheet here</a> so that you can use
your own parameters for your own set of results. Download it in your
preferred format and then edit the values under the Parameters column.
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/contact/">Contact me</a> if you have any problem using it. I will discuss the
result and make [my conclusion in the next and final post in this TFSA
trading cost-benefit analysis series][]. Hint: Short answer to the
title's question is NO. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

rate"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/TFSA_trading_cost-benefit_analysis.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<h2>Calculation Example</h2>
<p>For anyone interested, let's calculate one data point of the table above
using all the the steps discussed so far in this series. Using \$10 risk
(0.2% of \$5000) as an example. Known data: risk = \$10, commission
(comm) = \$5, reward/risk = 2.0, probability of win = 40% Round-trip
commission = \$5 x 2 = \$10 Average Reward = risk * (reward/risk) =
\$20 x (2.0) = \$20 Expected net profit = (Average Reward from Step 1 -
Commission) * (Probability of Win from Step 2) - [(Risked Amount +
Commission) * (1 - Probability of Win)] = (\$20 - \$10) * (40%) -
[(\$10 + \$10) * (1 - 40%)] = 10 * 0.4 - [\$20 * 0.6] = -\$8 If I
risk only \$10 on a trade, it is expected that I would <strong>lose</strong> \$8 on
average based on my historical trading performance statistics.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Part 1 of this TFSA trading account cost analysis series considered
the[costs of a TFSA trading account using data from my recent forex
trading][] (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/">forex trading is not allowed in a TFSA</a>, by the way) as a
hypothetical case study. I conclude that even if I can trade in my best
month, every month, I would still lose money in a TFSA because of the
high relative commission versus a limited principal balance. In this
second part of the series, I use my recent trading performance data to
compare trading a TFSA trading account with a non-registered trading
account (i.e. with capital gain tax). Feel free to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-4/">skip to my
conclusion in Part 4</a> if you don't care for the calculations. As I
said in my previous post, the key problem with a Questrade TFSA trading
account is the commission with respect to the small contribution limit
(\$5000 per year). The only way out of this is to risk more on each
trade such that the commission isn't as big as a portion of your cost
anymore. I normally risk 0.2% on each trade. In a \$5000 account, that
is \$10 risked per trade. With a commission of \$5 per trade, a
round-trip commission would also be \$10. So my total risk has doubled.
But if I increase my risk to 0.5% of my account, or \$25 per trade. A
\$10 commission is reduced to 40% of my total trading risk. As you can
imagine, a cost analysis spreadsheet is starting to take shape. It's
obvious that the more you risk on a trade (not a suggestion), the less
the effect of commission have on you because the commission is a fixed
cost. This isn't telling us anything useful so far. So let's take this a
step further by conducting a cost-benefit analysis. For that, we compare
net profits from a taxed trading account versus a tax-free trading
account. Consider the reward with respect to the risk per trade. Step 1.
Given each risk amount (e.g. 0.2%), what is my typical reward? In other
words, what is my reward/risk ratio in trading? That's easy for me to
identify as I've been keeping detailed <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">records of my trading</a>. Based
on my data from recent months, my reward/risk ratio is around 2.0. For
example, with a risk amount of 0.2% per trade, my average reward is 0.4%
per trade. Step 2. I find out how much capital gain tax I'm paying on
profit per trade. The capital gain tax in Canada is half the marginal
tax rate. Say my marginal tax rate is 35%, my capital gain tax is
effectively 17.5% because it is halved. So any profit which I derived
from a trade is taxed 17.5%. Step 3. Repeat steps 1-2 for each risk and
reward values. Putting the results into a table, we get the following.
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="361" caption="Risk amount vs.
capital gain tax table"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/TFSA-risk-tax-table.png" />][][/caption] Because the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade TFSA
trading account</a> (affiliate link) is tax free, the column of tax
amount is also representative of the saved dollar between a TFSA and a
regular trading account. As such, given a total commission of \$10 for a
trade. We can see from the table that the tax saved is more than the
commission for anything greater than a \$30 risk (\$60 profit) amount.
In more general terms, here's my first finding in this case study. Given
a reward/risk ratio of 2.0, the money saved per <strong>winning</strong> trade in a
TFSA trading account will be better than the commission paid if I risk
more than \$30 per trade, or the average reward per trade is more than
\$60. Notice I highlighted the word "winning". This is merely the first
part of a cost-benefit analysis. Unless you can win 100 percent of the
time, we need to take into account the money lost when trades don't go
as planned (more often than not). We still pay commissions on top of the
risked amount for all losing trades. That needs to be factored into our
cost-benefit analysis. In my next post in this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/cost-analysis/">cost analysis</a> series,
I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-3/">wrap up my calculations</a> by incorporating simple probability
theory to derive my <em>expected profit</em> after all is said and done.</p>
