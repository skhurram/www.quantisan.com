            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been trying to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/?s=bottom">catch falling knives</a> for a few weeks now.
Every time I think we're at a bottom, the market rally a bit to get my
hopes up and then continue to drift down more. In retrospect, there are
so many trading no-no's I have broken with that dangerous mentality. My
account is down significantly as of this writing and I have learned many
old and new lessons throughout these weeks. In fact, I have demonstrated
improving trading <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">technique</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1190/">psychology</a> even as I was losing
money overall (what an oxymoron). Rather I'm trying to comfort myself or
not, the fact is that losing money is simply unacceptable in trading. So
I will review these trades in this post and perhaps learn something from
them.</p>
<p>As the title suggest, this is a post for post-hoc analysis of the
options which I held into expiry (3 losing and 1 winning). I'll do this
chronologically. The longest Nov09 position I have is SLW Nov 2.5 Call.
I have been a big fan of SLW as I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written and traded SLW numerous
times</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, I've annoted my charts
more than usual and will show more and write less in this post. I noted
my entry point in each trade, and labelled the stop and post-hoc <strong>ideal
exit/stop points</strong>.</p>

<p>My effective <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">entry point in my SLW Nov 2.5 Calls</a> were at SLW share
price of \$2.90 (SLW closed at \$2.81 Friday). I bought 2 Calls for
\$0.55 and at expiry, they are worth \$0.325. A loss of \$45 + \$15 for
commission as of this writing. I held on to my 2.5 calls and exercised
them, so +200 shares of SLW for me.</p>
<p>Next up is ABB on the same day. The share price for ABB was at \$10.31
when I entered. ABB closed Friday at \$9.95. I bougt the three ABB Nov
10 Calls for \$0.90. They are worth \$0.05 each. A total loss of \$255 +
\$15 for commission.</p>

<p>Then we have TCK entered at TCK share price of \$5.575. I [bought two
TCK Nov 5 Calls for \$1.00][] each and they are now worthless. A
complete wipeout of \$200 + \$15 commission.</p>

<p>Lastly, there's this puny winning day trade in the last 40 minute of
Friday. I [bought a UYG Nov 3 Call for \$0.55][] and it expired for
\$0.95. A profit of \$40 - \$15 comission, so a total of +\$25 so far. I
held on to this call and exercised it. I have +100 shares of UYG to
carry over the weekend.</p>

<p>As you can see, <strong>if only I have used trailing stops, I could have held
onto some of the profits and not turn winning trades into a losing
ones</strong>. I didn't want to let the large swing in premiums stop me out
from a big rally. That's why I didn't use trailing stop. However, the
lack of subsequent follow-through and confirmation in the rally should
have been a glaring alarm sign. I should have put in trailing stops from
this lack of strength in the rally. <strong>Any counter-trend position should
be carefully managed with tighter than usual risk management</strong>.</p>
<p>I have let my <em>undying hope for a rally</em> clouded my judgement. This
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/move-from-certainty-to-curiosity-to-improve-your-trading/">stubborn need to be right</a> is a very fundamental psychological flaw
in trading. If I can't stop doing that in the future, I might as well
quit trading manually and focus on developing my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative financial
engineering</a> work. However, as I have noted, I think I'm improving
lately and upon further reflection, I believe I have come up with a
potential methodology to correct myself in the act ... More on this as I
develop on this technique.</p>

<p>Finally! I have been waiting for a bear market rally for weeks! I
decided to go <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">full long after the bounce from 820 today</a>. Refer to
that post for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">details of my entries</a>. In this post, I would like to discuss why the 820 bounce
gave me the confidence in going all in despite widespread fear and the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/covered-slw-fro-and-wfc-short-puts/">many failed attempts</a> myself.</p>
<p>A quick recap of the past week's action. After the failed rally attempt
from 10/28 to 11/04, the market has been brutal to say the least. Any
strength failed to stir enthusiasm and has bled down slowly. The market
drifted down lower on little volume day after day. If I were to describe
the market, I'd say it looked like the last moment of a dying man. This
lack of will to move has certainly killed many bulls. I was one of them.
I have been stopped out a few times trying to catch this falling knife
(more like a grind). I even prepared to exit the last of my holdings if
we do break down from this point.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the day, the market looked like it's going to be
another down drift today. But being very near the 10/10 bottom already,
I know things are going to move one way or the other before the options
expiry next week. And since the Max Pain for the index options are at
least 10% higher, I am still looking for a reversal soon.</p>
<p>I mentally noted S&amp;P at 845 is an important level. It was the low of the
10/28 big rally day. The market skid on the 845 level all morning with
little volume. That was good because it is testing a support on low
volume. I had thought we may bounce from there.</p>
<p>Then I went to lunch just before noon.</p>
<p>When I got back after 1pm, the market has already broken down. However,
there are several bullish indication I noticed.</p>
<ol>
<li>the break down volume is higher than the previous bar (Figure 1),
    but it's still relatively low. Which means we don't have panic
    selling yet.</li>
<li>both the TICK and Advance-Decline line moving averages (Figure 2)
    are relatively healthy for such an important drop. Indicating no
    broad selling.</li>
<li>notice the unusual V shape for the TICK (Figure 2)? We even reached
    a new multi-day low of -1666. Yet #1 and #2 contradicts this
    seemingly panic selling, so this depression in price looked
    artificial to me</li>
</ol>
<p>Like how the recent rally attempts lacked enthusiasm, this break of 845
and test of 820 looked like it lacked enthusiasm too. Given that this is
such a major support level, odds are that we will bounce from here at
least for intraday. That is when I made my entry.</p>
<p></p>
Before 2pm, we broke 850, the low of yesterday, with the highest 30 min
volume of the week. That is when the rally looked strong to me and my
doubt of a bull trap eased. Frankly, I had some tight mental stops and
prepared to jump if things deteriorate like the many times before.</p>
<p>The day continued strong with price and volume confirmation. We closed
at the high with significant volume. We even reached 700 million volume
on SPY, a first since 10/16. I believe an intermediate bottom has been
set so I'll be looking at a longer timeframe (days) for my long
positions now.</p>
<p>First expected resistance from this move is 980 on the S&amp;P from the
trendline (Figure 1, right). Target is at least the 50 dma, we just
haven't touched it for 2 months. This is as good a time as ever to give
it a run for it.</p>
<p>Today is a great example of the need for critical thinking with a clear
head in light of a lot of pressure and past emotion. The beaten account,
the grim market movement, and the many stopped out trades has nearly
made me walk away for the week. But I remained focus on the market and
made my decision based on the price action.</p>
<p>Despite renewed optimism, I will continue to practice <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">prudent risk
management</a> and to eventually pocket at least most of the profit from
today, if not more.</p>

<p>The market broke my intraday support line today (pink line, first
graph). What appeared to be a good Monday turned out to be very
disappointing. I cleared the last of my short puts (i.e. long) about 5
seconds before the close when the market gained some footing. These
plays are purely for risk management purposes, each individual stock
looks ok to me to be accumulating at this level. But I'm in for the
swing trade and it haven't worked out. So I'm selling them all mainly
because the overall market looks weak.</p>
<p>To illustrate, today's intraday market data looked particularly bad. I
thought the market would turnaround after the TICK retested a -1200 low
for the day at noon on lower price, but the price continued to drift
down afterward. Then the 2pm rally didn't even break 930 (resistance
from yesterday) too. That was the last draw for me and I decided to exit
all risky positions from then on to minimize my risk. So I covered all
my options into the close.</p>
<p>The first of which was Dec SLW 5 put at 15:48 for \$1.70, which I
[bought at \$1.55][]. I still have my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-166-slw882-limit/">166 shares of SLW</a>, so it's an
obvious choice for me to unload the options. I don't want to be too
heavy on precious metal for now. SLW is still holding the \$3.4 level
and marked a higher low in the afternoon. So it's actually looking good.</p>

<p>Next I sold FRO at 15:59:27. The low of today looks like a test of a
daily trendline, pink line below on the right daily graph (Update: I
forgot to attach the graph. I added it a day later below). I normally
would have only sold if it breaks it, but again, the market looks bad.
So a retest of \$30 (highest volume in recent months) seems possible. I
covered the [FRO short puts bought at \$7.90][] for \$8.00. On another
note, I mistakenly placed a sell order on the put rather than a buy (to
cover) at \$8.10. So I quickly covered that accidental trade at \$8.30
regardless of that fact that FRO was moving up at that time. I've
learned my lesson in accidental orders and would cover immediately
regardless. I won't try to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-58-caf-2889-limit/">convince myself like my CAF trade</a>.</p>

<p>I covered my Nov [WFC short put bought at \$3.60][] for \$3.00 at
15:59:55. Fee \$7.50.</p>
<p>I almost didn't want to give up my WFC position. It was the strongest
and the one most profitable of my Friday's swing trades. In particular,
last Friday's turnaround has by far the most volume in several months.
The \$28.0 support looks almost impenetrable. Indeed, today's low of
\$28.04 looks safe and we only tested it at very low volume. Indeed, I
really don't think we'll see this low again in the short term. Looking
at this more carefully now, maybe I should leave it open ... Oh well, I
can always get back in.</p>

my positions</a>. On the other hand, for the times when I executed a
trade as planned, I showed remarkable ability to make <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-of-the-day-bailed-out-of-a-wrong-position/">sound decisions
on the fly even under strenuous conditions</a>. Thus, it is in my best
interest to perform consistently and learn to be objective in my market
analysis.</p>
<p>I have come up with two solutions for my problem. 1) Make more use of
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">computational tools</a> and 2) improve my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-psychology/">trading psychology</a>.</p>
<p>In this particular post, I'd like to address my psychological barriers.
Coincidentally, a book I've been reading about conflict resolution
(Stone, et. al., "<em>Difficult Conversations</em>," pg 38+) has suggested
techniques that I think can be applied for trading.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, we argue with other people because of
difference of opinions. Similarly, we lose money in the market because
we are <em>arguing</em> with the market. The first step in conflict resolution
is understanding ourselves.</p>
<p>As best as we might try to remove emotion in our trading decision, the
tendency to develop unconsciously biased perception is very human. Our
perception about a situation is based on</p>
<ol>
<li>our selection of information</li>
<li>our interpretation</li>
<li>our conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>Some people use candlestick charts, some uses line graphs. A bullish
crossover on the RSI can mean a turn of sentiment to some or imminent
opportunity to short for others. These are just some examples of how we
add our personal touch to each problem. Indeed, I don't think
eliminating emotion from the equation is advisable. It is our
experience, our knowledge, and our skills that we should rely on to make
tough decisions. Since decisions happen so fast and generally involve
more subconscious than not, we are not aware of all the influences of
our views.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
One way to keep an unbiased opinion is to thoroughly understand how you
came to a conclusion. Why did we select one information over the other?
What assumptions are we making in an interpretation? How did we come up
with a conclusion based on our interpretations? In other words, shift
from a certain stance about our conclusion to a curious state about the
entire thinking process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One way to shift your stance from the easy certainty of feeling that
you've thought about this from every possible angle is to get curious
about what you don't know about yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping an open mind with a curious approach can help you evaluate
wether your views make sense in light of new information and
perspective.</p>
<p></p>
For example, the way I analyze a potential <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/entry/">trade entry</a> is to think
from both sides of the trade (go long or go short). Ultimately, I enter
the trade as planned if my analysis is stronger than the
counter-arguments.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>While I haven't written about my stance on the flood of bailouts, I have
been against it all along. Pouring tax payers' <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122540927284586151.html">money into a select few
elites</a> in the name of <em>helping</em> the economy has sank my respect for
the American government to a new low. This is just like the Bush's
Weapons of Mass Destruction lies and the subsequent Iraq invasion all
over again, only on an epic scale and the effect much more encompassing.
However, the situation have reached a new low. In today's news, there's
talk of banks asking for credit card debt forgiveness. They might as
well just hand out each American a million dollar cheque. Then watch the
American dollar become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar">Zimbobwe money</a> and plunge America back to the
Medieval era when people would barter for their goods. The sheer
stupidity of this move is below even that of Bush's intelligence! If
what the U.S.A. is doing lately isn't socialism, then I don't know what
is. That is one huge factor why I've been long gold and silver with my
accumulating position in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">SLW</a>. It looks as though we might be in for
a continued downtrend in precious metal prices. But sooner or later,
prices will reflect their true values. Update: The Big Picture made a
post about <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/10/moral-hazard-of.html">mortgage bailouts</a> today on the same issue. Barry puts the
issue of bailing out bad debts succinctly, "moral hazard not only
encourages recklessness, it leads to people looking to avoid
responsibility for bad decisions."</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>While the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122518913601675675.html">market is sorting things out today</a>, I'd like to document a
simple stock price predictor based on put/call activity called Option
Pain or Max Pain.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that professional traders favour writing options.
Since trading options is a zero-sum game, it is in their best interest
if a majority of options expire worthless on expiration day.</p>
<p>By observing the open interest of a stock at each strike price, we can
see at what price the Option Pain would occur. Of course, this is just
another tool for the trader to use, so do your own due diligence as
usual when trading.</p>

<p>Using this chart from <a href="http://www.optionpain.com/MaxPain/Max-Pain.php">Option Pain</a>, we can see that the minimum
option total value of November SLW is at \$5. So our max pain price is
at \$5 for November's SLW. That is to say, if SLW settles at \$5, then
the most call option would expire worthless and most of the put option
would expire worthless. Such that the option sellers (the pros) can
pocket your money.</p>
<p>Another way to use this information is to find the best Max Pain to
Current Price ratio among a list of stocks. For example, SLW closed at
\$2.59 yesterday. Its max pain is \$5 from the chart above. That is
almost a double. Note, however, that we haven't figured out the
probability of SLW reaching \$5. This would be something for me to look
into.</p>
<p>In comparison, GOOG's max pain for November is at \$360. Its previous
closing price is 329.49. Based on these numbers, SLW is a better buy
than GOOG for now.</p>
