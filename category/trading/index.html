            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Early in 2010, I discussed about my plan to [grow my trading accounts
organically and eventually trade for a living][] (i.e. live and breath
in the market 24/7). Now that the first whole year of my long term plan
has passed, I can update my visualization table as shown. <img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2011-01-14-monetarygoal.png" /> 2010 was
a good year. My starting capital for 2011 is 63% more than expected.
This is mostly due to the \$13,000 prize money from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">winning six of nine
Dukascopy automated trading contests</a>. On the contrary to my
fortuitous success, I revised some of my estimations noted in the table
to be even more conservative. In particular, I reduced my annual deposit
to reflect real bookkeeping data in 2010 and lowered my investment yield
expectation based on my performance data throughout the past 10 years of
my trading. To mitigate these reductions, I expect to continue
depositing funds while I receive a salaried income rather than stop
mid-way as originally proposed. The effect of inflation is deliberately
ignored in this table because I'm discounting its effect in my
investment yield estimate rather than adding more columns. It's all
guess work for now anyway. Nineteen years is indeed a long time. It is a
<em>worst case scenario</em> assuming that I will grow my accounts organically
and not do anything else. I doubt I will need that much time as there
are means other than trading a personal account to achieve trading for a
living. I might discuss more about this later in the year once something
materialize. My focus this year is to finish developing my proprietary
Java trading platform with my partner and put it to good use in the
forex market. Nineteen years or not, the fact that trading for a living
is even possible for a self-taught amateur such as myself is testament
to these incredible times that we're living in. I fully intend to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-sign-that-you-are-truly-enjoying-what-you-do/">enjoy
every second of it</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I pondered over this issue over the holiday as I'm finding myself
juggling too many tasks. I was participating in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-trading-contest-from-dukascopy/">two trading
contests</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">developing an automated trading system</a> with a team,
managing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">an open-source project</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/stocks/">actively trading</a>, and writing
this blog, all on top of a full time job. I got greedy in what I wanted
to accomplish and it is negatively affecting my performance. The first
symptom popped up in my trading, not surprisingly. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/story-of-a-bad-trade-and-a-missed-opportunity/">made a bad call
and missed a long-awaited opportunity</a>. This was a wakeup call as the
performance statistics from my recent trades is showing statistically
significant deviations (I will publish the data soon). So before
anything gets out of hand, I've decided to manage my time more
professionally rather than just do what needs to be done. Taking a page
from my professional work, I will prioritize my trading and development
work using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method">Eisenhower Method</a>. Basically, I mentally stamp an
importance and urgentness ranking to each of my tasks. Then I will work
on the important and urgent tasks first and leave the rest til later in
order of the ranking criteria. For example, the automated contest is
important and urgent because I've won over USD\$10,000 in 2010 and
there's a monthly deadline for it. So I work on it first if there's work
to do, which isn't much. The <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/tradercontest/?action=blog&amp;trader=Quantisan">manual trading contest</a>, on the other
hand, is urgent but not so important. If I were to participate in it
seriously, I would need to allocate an hour or so each night to trade.
This is time that I would rather spend working on other stuff. On the
other end of the importance/urgentness spectrum is my equities trading.
I am rating it as an unimportant and non-urgent task. Although I've
written the most about it and that my account has been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">up 21% in
2010</a>, it takes a lot of my time and the absoluate return is small.
That is because my equities account is the smallest of my various
trading accounts. So 21% profit of a small account is still very small.
Thus, this account isn't worth devoting too much time for now. My plan
is to use a beta strategy for my equities account. I already have some
ideas on what to do with it. This will be discussed in another post.
Ultimately, here's an excerpt of my priority list:</p>
<ol>
<li>trading system development</li>
<li>automated trading contest</li>
<li>quant research</li>
<li>documentation and blog posting</li>
<li>trading strategy R&amp;D</li>
<li>manual trading contest</li>
<li>equities trading</li>
</ol>
<p>What this means to you as a reader is that there will be fewer charts
and more technical discussion. My goal for 2011 is to post something at
least once a week. This is a good time to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/feed/">subscribe to my RSS feed</a>
to have new posts delivered to you rather than having to keep checking
here for updates.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>For some traders, building a trading system means that they focus on
finding the best indicators they could get their hands on or the one
trading setup that is backtested to work 99% of the time. All I can say
is, to each his own. For me, the keyword of a trading system lies not
with <em>trading</em>, but with <em>system</em>. Remember, it is a system. First of
all, it is a system <em>for trading</em>. Not a system <em>to trade</em>. What do I
mean by that? Consider this saying, "traders don't go broke by missing
opportunities, they go broke by taking too many." A trading system needs
to be selective. It needs <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">prudent risk management</a>. Secondly, you
need to generate your own market view to trade. Rather it be technical,
fundamental, sentimental, or just following some joe, you trade based on
your view. Trading is a test of your market hypothesis using money. If
you think the market will rise, you buy. If you think the market will
fall, you short. Lastly, a trading system needs to execute trades.
Otherwise you'd be an anlayst. It needs to time <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/entry/">entries</a> and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/exit/">exits</a>. Again, this could be as simple as on a whim or as complicated
as some n-th order algorithm. Thus we have the three pillars of a
trading system.</p>
<ol>
<li>Risk Management</li>
<li>Market Analysis</li>
<li>Trade Execution</li>
</ol>
<p>What's more, if we combine some of these pillars we get some well known
concepts. For example, market analysis + trade execution = trading
signals, wherein you derive signals based on market conditions to
execute trades. Or risk management + trade execution = position
management, wherein you manage your holdings by manipulating your trades
based on your risk profile. All these relationships and composition of a
trading system can be summarized with a Venn diagram. So, this is my
view of a trading system:</p>
