            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-talk-at-or54-on-knowledge-discovery-with-web-log-data/">gave a talk</a> at the 54th Annual Conference on Operational Research last week in Edinburgh. Operational Research is "using advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions" [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_research">wiki</a>]. This field has been around long before data science and business intelligence. After listening to so many talks and talking to so many academics from marketing to finance to industrial engineering, I find that what we do are quite similar on a 30 thousand feet level -- using data to solve problems. Yet, there is a fundamental difference to our approaches. Whereas operational research is about constructing analytical theories; data science is about constructing models.</p>
<p>One of the talks that I recall is from a phd from Dubai about optimising maintenance scheduling in desalination plants. Desalination plants is big business in the Middle East as they provide a major source of fresh water there. However, components in these plants fail often because of the harsh condition that they work in and that servicing some of these components might need to bring the entire plant down for hours. The presenter proceeded to explain their method of using a Poisson process on the failure data to optimise maintenance work.</p>
<p>Now if it were me, I would add tons of sensors everywhere to enhance the frequency and granularity of data captured. Similar to what we do at work for web data. Then the problem practical solve itself as we'll be able to build predictive models for each and every crucial component. Using on-going data with these predictive models, we can flag high risk components and service them before they cause trouble.</p>
<p>The problem is that adding sensors is not trivial (from my electrical engineering days) in a physical system. The high cost of installing all of that and the questionable efficacy of measurements make getting data a challenge. For problems like this, I can see where a traditional scientific thinking of using sparse data to support theories is practical.</p>
<p>Yet, not everything can be reduced to formulas and solved analytically. As this blog piece on Scientific American points out, <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/2012/09/05/theories-models-and-the-future-of-science/">science is moving towards solving problems computationally</a>. So too are the industries as we've seen examples from Amazon and LinkedIn driving massive sales by modelling and enabling a feedback loop with their data.</p>
<p>It's a shame that so many companies are poisoning the term Big Data these days by plastering it all over their marketing material to sell products with no substance. There are real strategic advantages to be reaped if companies can do it right.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Web log data contains a wealth of information about online visitors. We have a record of each and every 
customer interaction for the millions of visitors coming through each month at uSwitch.com. The challenge 
is to analyse this discrete time series, semi-structured dataset to understand the behaviour of our visitors on 
a personal level. This talk is a case study of how our data team of three leveraged heterogeneous 
architecture and agile methodologies to tackle this problem. And we had three months.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Our data team of 3 is tasked with pushing our business to be more
data-driven. From encouraging management to make strategic decisions
with hard data to building real-time feedback loop within our products
themselves. We have built the infrastructure in place to capture and
analyse streams of high granularity data using open source tools like
Kafka, Hadoop, and Cascalog. Now the hard part is to convince the rest
of the company that counted numbers on an Excel spreadsheet is
insufficient so that they can incorporate these new high-frequency and
high-granularity information in their everyday decision-making process.</p>
<p>This came to light for me when I tried to revamp our Attribution
Modelling, which is a fancy marketing term for how referral is
attributed and doesn't have to do with mathematical modelling at all.
Many companies traditionally use a last-referral-takes-the-cake
approach. Say if a customer comes in via an email referral first, leaves
the site, then comes back in from an Adword to ultimately make a
purchase, the Adword would get attributed for that revenue produced.
This last-referral method is a lazy way of doing things. Lead generating
referrals get no credit and return on investment values are biased
towards closing-stage marketing efforts. Granted, doing anything else
would require a global view of customer journey, which is a non-trivial
matter. </p>
<p>However, that is exactly what we're able to do easily now. So we
took a couple of days to spike out a fair-share attribution model such
that every touch point a customer used get a share of the pie. The
intention is to provide a holistic view of referrers efficacy to feed
into our higher-level models. But seeing that the old system is so
unrealistic, I thought I might as well open it for everyone else.</p>
<p>Opening a can of worms, that was what it felt like. I found that things
like financial reports and people's bonuses are tied to this old
attribution modelling system. Even though it is obvious to everyone that
the old attribution modelling system is unrealistic, changing it would
require changing the work processes of multiple individuals across the
company. You know what they say about people's habits? Habits are hard
to change. </p>
<p>Seeing that this is a fundamental obstacle to our company's
competitiveness, I've taken a break from pushing our data architecture
to build and evangelise internal data products. I've been working
closely individually with our business people to identify ways of using
data, staging data views from Hadoop/Cascalog back into good old MySQL,
and assisting them to generate actionable data with SQL to make their
lives easier. </p>
<p>One of such views borrows a technique from my algorithmic
trading. By applying a breakout strategy (which I wrote entirely in SQL,
good fun) on the revenue and cost time-series data of our PPC and SEO
campaigns, our PPC/SEO manager now have available a customisable
screener for abnormality with any of our thousands of continuous
marketing campaigns. Very much like a stock screener for breakouts. This
used to be a subjective process based on a spreadsheet of numbers and
expert opinions. Now it's data-driven. </p>
<p>There's a saying that a business
is its people. To become a data-driven organisation, you need
data-driven people. I never realised the significance of this until now.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The other day our marketing guy dropped a laundry list of reports that
he wanted me to produce. I work with him sometimes so I don't mind
putting on a business intelligence hat occasionally to help him out. But
I mustn't forget that driving long-term values to the business is what I
am good at, so I had to say no to him. What's supposed to be a quick
chat with him ended up in a hour long discussion to show case what I'm
working on and demonstrating that I can do so much more than count
things for him. In short, if you want data, ask the business analyst; if
you want to solve problems, let's talk.</p>
<p>It's been said that <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2012/04/04/big-data-reference-model">Big Data
analysis is a feedback loop</a>. However, I don't think having the data science team toil away at data is the message. Who's to say that analytical steps in a big data reference model can't involve feedback
from people in addition to models? For the past week, I've been
showcasing a new internal data product to various stakeholders in our
business. This one data product is now leading to a new process for our
accountant, a product for our online marketing manager, and an
innovative company-wide metric. All of this happened because we
collaborated rather than delegated tasks. Analysing data is not a
one-way process. <a href="http://s.hbr.org/IIVNL0">Make it a feedback loop of math and people</a>.</p> </div>
