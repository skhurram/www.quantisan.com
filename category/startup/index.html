            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been growing fond of this trendy Go programming language lately. We use it at Glassy Media to build services over HTTP and command line. So when we needed a Amazon Mechanical Turk interface I thought why not use Go for that too? I found an existing library in <a href="https://github.com/crowdmob/goamz">Go for interacting with Amazon Web Services</a>. But its Mechanical Turk component is incomplete. So I dove into the source code and started patching to make it work.</p>
<p>A weekend of coding later, I still haven't finished. Then I realised what I was doing. I was building a cool solution but not actually solving the problem at hand. This might have been beneficial for a capable company to help contribute back to the open source community. But not where I'm at -- a new startup that's stretching thin on resources. We simply couldn't afford to lose focus at this phase. So I switched over to good ole Python. The <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto">boto</a> Python interface to AWS worked just fine. The result was that there were no "I did this in Go" blog post to write about but our problem was solved and we moved on to the next task.</p>
<p>This sense of building cool solutions just for the sake of it seem common in tech. Just last week at a Go meetup, someone spoke about Using Reflections in Go. Even Rob Pike, the man himself, wrote that reflection "should be used with care and avoided unless strictly necessary". Somehow that was taken as a challenge.</p>
<p><img alt="challenge accepted" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/200px-challenge-acepted.png" /></p>
<p>I am guilty of glorifying new technologies and putting down on tried and true solutions too. On more occasions than I dare to admit at data conferences, I participated in bashing at SQL databases with the attendees. I can't speak for others, but for me it was due to ignorance. I used SQL a few times before but was put off by the data warehousing aspect of it. Having gotten more familiar with MySQL in particular over the past couple years, SQL can be simple and beautiful too. I have actually come to prefer it in some cases. Use the right tool for the right task, right?</p>
<p>An example of focusing on solving the problem. Here is one of the distilled tech specs we have for a component.</p>
<ol>
<li>A webpage for users to view a dataset of their private contacts</li>
<li>Sorting capabilities on some of the data fields</li>
<li>Expected number of contacts per user is several hundreds</li>
<li>Limit to no more than 10 - 20 users at beta launch</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the efforts went into distilling our problem to make it as easy as possible. Like letting the user edit the data? Nope. UX design? Not until we figure out what data to surface. Because the problem specs are concise, solving this is almost trivial. Our current technical stack to solve this is embarassingly simplistic:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS/Javascript for front end hosted on Heroku,</li>
<li>Go for REST-based backend on Heroku; and</li>
<li>Google Spreadsheet as database.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing fancy. Yes, we didn't even bother with spinning up a database.</p>
<p>People build more complicated things in a hackday than this. That's because the real problem we have is that we <em>think</em> this is needed with no real proof yet. Perhaps all they need is just having CSV files emailed to them? We tried that too. We want to get this out to our customers as soon as possible for them to use and give us feedback. What is the task that this component is doing for our customers in the scope of our product experience? Abstract problems like these are not trivial and validating them is why we are building things in a startup. Not the other way around.</p>
<p>As I was reminiscing earlier this year, effective problem solving is more about <a href="/what-i-learned-from-2-years-of-data-sciencing/">defining a clear problem than coming up with a smart solution</a>. "A problem well stated is a problem half-solved." In a pursuit of the latest and greatest, I sometimes find myself swung too far in the pendulum towards <a href="/event-driven-finite-state-machine-for-a-distributed-trading-system/">glorifying the solution</a> rather than appreciating the effectiveness of clarifying the problem. Sometimes the best solution is to realise <em>not</em> to do something.</p>
<p>At this early stage of our startup, the biggest problem should clearly be shipping and learning. Being a Clojure enthusiast myself, we've only used Clojure for 2 of the dozen or so of projects shipped. Most of the rest are a mix of Python, Go, Javascript, Bash scripts, or even Google Doc macros. However, don't mistaken getting things done quickly with cutting corners or committing spaghetti code.  We are adament about keeping our software architecture as simple and decoupled as possible. If that's done right, the individual implementation don't matter because we can always rewrite any of them without impacting the system. That Mechanical Turk project? You can bet that we'll come back to refactor it later if it proves useful. Maybe we'll pick up on goamz again. But at least it's shipped now. I am focusing on the problem and not let building a startup become a technical challenge to satisfy my vanity.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>We knew early on that paying customers is the only metric that we can believe in. We have paying customers now, but we don't have a business yet until we know our product/market fit. A problem with having paying customers is that the day-to-day work of delivering and executing can drown out the big picture. Thinking in first principles helps keep us iterating towards a product/market fit while we immerse ourselves on learning from our individual customers.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">only</span> <span class="n">thing</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">matters</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">getting</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">product</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">market</span> <span class="n">fit</span><span class="p">.</span>

<p>First of all, what does it getting to product/market fit mean? After some failed starts and pivots to our business, I think I sort of get it now. Here are three questions we ask ourselves to check if we are heading to a product/market fit.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this viable with the resources we have now?</li>
<li>Is this profitable before our next bills arrive?</li>
<li>Is this scalable to take us to our next stage?</li>
</ol>
<p>One lesson we learned is to focus on the immediate future. Not 6 months down the line. Our company simply couldn't afford to try things out for 6 months with a mere chance of success. We try to find our product-market fit now to take us there, not the other way around.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, we have a few paying customers but we still haven't found our product/market fit yet. We have a product. With a market. But not necessarily a <em>fit</em>. A fit imples an optimal product and market match.</p>
<p>Last week, it finally dawned on me that finding a product/market fit is an optimisation problem. What are the variables that you're optimising for?</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p><img alt="Supply Demand curve" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/400px-Supply-and-demand.svg.png" /></p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>I realised that product/market fit is supply and demand in disguise. Finding a product/market fit is an exercise in finding your supply and demand curves. This puts the abstract problem of finding product/market fit into data exploration actions to take to fill a graph.</p>
<p>Taking our startup as an example, this is our supply curve at the moment (drawn as a straight line for simplicity).</p>
<p><img alt="Inelastic supply curve" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/inelastic_supply_curve.png" /></p>
<p>A bit of background. Our main product isn't a web application or a software yet, it is a service. We delivered for our first clients through hustling and manual labour. As a 3-person startup, there are only so many clients we can take on while we are developing our software tools. So our supply curve is limited by capacity and is insensitive to price.</p>
<p>Note that there is theoretically an infinite set of options, deliverables, and products that we can offer in our market space. The lines that we draw would be different for each set. So bear in mind that this is not an academic proof but <em>a mental exercise</em> to help us move systematically faster.</p>
<p>Now that we have our supply curve/line, we only need the demand curve to complete this graph. This is the side of the market that we are most uncertain about. What does our client really want? How much are they willing to pay?</p>
<p><img alt="Supply and unknown demand curves" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/supply_unknown_demand_curve.png" /></p>
<p>We sold to our first clients at a price point that is a fraction of industry average to get our hands dirty and to learn if we can do this (Question #1). We quickly reached our capacity and was inundated with work to deliver on our promise. But remember that our goal is to learn our supply and demand graph and not necessarily <em>only</em> to learn about our individual customer needs. Referring to the supply and demand graph below where we undersold at a low price, yes, we learned about our work process, but we didn't learn anything about the demand curve at that price simply because we couldn't meet the demand. After we were at capacity, we stopped looking for clients for a couple weeks while we served the ones onboard.</p>
<p><img alt="Supply and demand at artificially low price" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/low_price_supply_demand.png" /></p>
<p>Suppose our capacity is 3 clients at a time. If we sold at a higher price and had 3 of 10 people said yes (instead of 3 of 3 we had at a low price), we learned something about the price while still signing up to the same number of customers. Then we could adjust our price to a bit lower in the next round to find 3 of 7 people sign up instead. With a slight change in approach, we would be getting data about our demand curve while serving the same number of clients.</p>
<p><img alt="Supply and demand finding market price" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/market_lowq_supply_demand.png" /></p>
<p>This is one illustration of how thinking in supply and demand can make us go faster. Now that we can rely on existing principles in our product/market search, we can do this systematically. Much smarter people have thought about microeonomics and laid the ground work for us to leverage. Hopefully we can find our product/market fit even faster with these principles in hand.</p> </div>
