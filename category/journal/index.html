            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>About ten years ago I was an electrical engineering intern at MDA Space Robotics. They are the company that designed the Canadarm 1 and 2 used on the International Space Station. I still remember meeting the R&amp;D team next door to see their demo of a 3D LIDAR system mounted on a Mars Rover model. It was one of the competing designs to serve as the eyes of the rover. To put this into perspective, this was at a time when a single-beam scanning laser was common on a robot to gauge distances. Seeing a vision system which can generate 3D polygons of the terrain in real-time for navigation was just unbelievable.</p>
<p>As for our mundane electronics team, we were designing new power electronics to upgrade the Canadarm2. Obviously, I didn't actually contribute much as an intern. One project which I had my hands on was building loading circuits to simulate the electrical response of the motors on the Canadarm2. So that we can test the new power electronics with live circuit without having motors spinning in the lab. For my particular role, I didn't do any of that either. What I did was design and build safety housing for these big loading circuits.</p>
<p>Normally, this wouldn't take more than a couple days in a workshop. Not so in a regulated industry. Even though these boxes were only used as a superficial safety mechanism during ground support testing and were never going to be used in production or have anything to do with the actual test itself, we still needed to follow proper engineering guidelines because my mentor told me that it's safer to have a blanket rule for every component than nit-pick what is or isn't regulated.</p>
<p>After designing the housing in no time (it's just a rectangular shell to cover the circuit, how hard can it be?), I sourced a contractor to mold these polycarbonate shells for us. That's the same material hockey masks use because it's transparent and strong. To secure the shell onto the loading circuit, which are about as big as a moving box each, I needed big screws to bolt it on the baseboard. Seeing that we're an electrical team, we didn't have suitable screws for it in the lab. I figured I should just drive down to Home Depot to buy them.</p>
<p>Not so fast. Apparently, as I was technically sourcing in a new component, I couldn't just go down the street and get them. I ended up having to order from one of our approved suppliers and had them shipped to us overnight. Not that I was in any hurry. It's because we did all shipping by courier. And even though I needed just a few screws, the supplier don't do small orders either so I had to order the minimum of a hundred or something. Still, all of that didn't really cost that much. The majority of the cost came from my hours spent in getting technical and administrative approvals for adding this new component into our bill of material.</p>
<p>And so that is how I ended up spending the company around $2000 on a few screws. I never saw an itemised bill for those screws. But I figured that's about right based on hours spent and people's estimated salaries.</p>
<p>This forgotten story from my engineering days came about this week as <a href="http://oobaloo.co.uk/">my colleague Paul</a> and I were spiking out a big data project on Amazon Redshift. On a whim just for the sake of it, we launched a 32 virtual cores, 240GB memory, 32TB storage multi-node cluster with literally just the click of a button. We played with it for a couple hours, did what was needed, and decommissioned the cloud servers. It cost us $45.</p>
<p>What is my point of the stories? Same concept of materialising an idea. Different time, different industry. Diametrically different prototyping experience.</p>
<p>Update: this post generated some heated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5685078">debates on Hacker News</a>.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Back in November, I started working as a Data Scientist at <a href="http://www.uswitch.com">uSwitch</a>,
an utility price comparison site. I am very fortunate to be able to work
with so many <a href="http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/">smart and passionate</a> people there. There is so much
that I am learning in fact, I haven't had time to do much else. Although
my ridiculous 4-hour commute is also a factor. I didn't even notice that
EUR/USD dropped 1000 pips! As such, I am officially putting my own
business and research on hold until further notice. I will continue to
post relevant technical discussions on this blog. All of my existing
clients have been notified and arrangements made way back before I began
my employment. Thank you for all your support!</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>My wife is pursuing graduate study at Oxford. So I'm taking this rare
opportunity to quit my day job and concentrate on developing trading
systems full time. I am also doing some consulting to keep in touch with
civilization. I have just one project at the moment building a customer
relation system for a friend's financial services startup.</p>
<p>Now for some self-promotion. I specialise in building software systems
for information discovery, and of course, trading systems too. If you
know of any business that can make use of an information discovery
system for better customer relation, inventory management, etc, then
please forward <a href="mailto:paul@quantisan.com">email</a>.</p>
<p>That's it for the public service announcement. I'll be off to my first
meetup this Sunday to hack on an open source statistical computing
platform. I can't wait to meet some very smart people!</p> </div>

This could take a few months. I am also deliberating rather I should
revert Quantisan.com back as a pure blog again and separate QTD on its
own domain. Quantisan.com has too much random topics and history that
makes it difficult to keep a consistent message as a company blog.</p> </div>
