            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My stomach felt awkward after dinner last night. Then around 2am, I felt
like I wanted to vomit. Minutes afterward, my previous meal came gushing
out. That was the most awful experience I've ever felt. Even worse than
the time when I crashed into a ditch while going down a steep hill on my
mountain bike... My throat felt burning from the stomach acid. So being
as bright as I am, I drank some milk and some honey water. Not a good
idea. First of all, I <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/food_poisoning/article_em.htm">shouldn't have any dairy or citrus product for
the first day</a> according to eMedicineHealth. Secondly, my stomach
needed rest before I poured more stuff down. So not too long afterward,
I vomitted a second time. By then, it was pretty evident that I have
food poisoning. I could barely standup and felt dizzy. I took a sip of
water to sooth my throat, researched what I should do online, and just
went back to sleep. Geeky, I know. It was faster to just Google it than
find the number and consult the 24-hour telehealth line we have here in
Canada. But I promised myself that if I vomit a third time, I would go
to the hospital. Fortunately, I didn't have to resort to that. The
instructions online actually worked. I took a nap and allowed my stomach
to rest. Then I gradually drank more and more water and mixed in some
soft food to regain my strength. Took me 2 long hours to eat a banana
and a bowl of oatmeal plus water. After a few more hours of sleep, I
feel much better now. I called in sick at work for today and tomorrow
just in case. I'm just going to chill for a day or two. I see that the
forex market is making some impressive moves overnight. I couldn't care
less at this moment.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>RRSP contribution deadline on March 1st is fast approaching. Like most
Canadians, this is pretty much the only time when I give my<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_Retirement_Savings_Plan">Registered
Retirement Savings Plan</a> some attention. Right now, my RRSP balance
stands at \$0. That's right, nothing. I've been putting my money at work
for 10 years trading all sorts of markets but willfully ignoring the
biggest cost to any trader. Taxes. Now that my marginal tax rate is for
the first time running above 30%, and with no tax break in sight, it's
time that I take a hard look at my tax strategies to reduce my trading
costs. Don't worry, this isn't yet another post about RRSP. (But if
you're indeed looking for RRSP information, I point you to a Canadian
personal finance blog, <a href="http://www.milliondollarjourney.com/">MillionDollarJourney</a>) The reason why I
haven't placed money into my RRSP is same as why I don't invest in real
estates. Which is, a lack of liquidity. As the name suggest, RRSP is for
retirement. Here's the problem simplistically put. If I take money out
while I'm still working, I get taxed at my full marginal tax rate for
those money. Even if they were supposed to be capital gain. Thus I
effectively lose my 50% tax discount from my investment capital gain. So
money into my RRSP would effectively be locked in while my salary is
still my main source of income! I don't have a wad of cash where I can
just stash away yet. So that's why my RRSP stands at \$0 this year.
Although I am thinking of opening an RRSP soon... But I digressed. The
fact is, taxes in Canada is ridiculously high. So I need to do something
about it soon. While looking for RRSP information, I came across
Questrade's Tax Free Trading Account. It is a reincarnation of the <a href="http://www.tfsa.gc.ca/">Tax
Free Savings Account</a>. As far as I know, Questrade is the only
discount broker offering this type of account. Basically, it is a
trading account in which there is no income taxes involved and any
profit taken out would not count towards annual income too. Sounds too
good to be true? Here are 3 limitations for a TFSA trading account.</p>
<ol>
<li>Limit of \$5,000 contribution per year</li>
<li>Extra costs for trading the U.S. markets</li>
<li>Cash account only, no margin.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will discuss #2 shortly. But #3 is what matters the most to me as a
trader. No margin means no leverage, no shorting, and no futures and
forex trading. No shorting?! One-way trading is not a good thing for a
trader. This is obviously a ploy to get people to buy, buy, buy. And no
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex trading</a>?! Yet, I can't expect to have my cake and eat it too.
Yes, this TFSA trading thing has strings attached. But. It's tax-free!
That's enough incentive for me to consider incorporating it into my
portfolio. Make no mistake, this will not be my primary, or even
secondary, trading account. My plan is to use it as an
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ultra-conservative</span>
investment vehicle only. It's about time that I replace my abysmal 1%
yield savings account! Before<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade">opening a Questrade TFSA trading
account</a> (affliate link) though, I need to do my homework on Canadian
stocks. Because TFSA is a Canadian government offer, trading U.S.
markets would incur extra costs (a devious way of "Buy Canadian"). As
such, the only cost effective way for me to maximize a TFSA trading
account is to trade TSX and TSX Ventures stocks. This is yet another
item on my to-do list. Come up with a strategy to trade this account
<strong>with minimal risks</strong> (can't stress this enough)using Canadian stocks.
I actually have some ideas already. But I'll save that for another time.
In my next series of posts, I ask a fundamental investment question like
any trader should. Is a \$5000 Questrade TFSA trading account cost
effective? P.S. For more information on Questrade, youngandthrifty.ca
offers a <a href="http://youngandthrifty.ca/questrade-review-2/">review of this discount broker</a>.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>
One of the frontpage stories in my local newspaper today tells the tale
of how a [Deadly crash shattered teacher's life][]. A young couple is
left permanently paralyzed for one and crippled for the other. All
because of "brazen and aggressive" driving of two other drivers. Alan
Kippax was racing with his cousin Peter Kippax on the street. Peter lost
control of his Porsche and crashed into the aforementioned young
couple's Pontiac. Peter died in the crash and Alan was sentenced to be
guilty of his contribution in this tragedy. While this is certainly a
sad news, unfortunately, it isn't rare either. And what does it have to
do on my trading blog? You see, it is actually the last line of the
article that really caught my attention.

> Kippax, who used to run an emerald marketing network, Ontario Treasure
> Traders International, is global sales manager for Business In Motion.

Business In Motion. That rings a bell in my head. Exactly a year ago,
[CBC News aired an investigative journal][] on this company. In the
show, PSA President Robert L. FitzPatrick concludes:

> BIM is a blatant pyramid scam which ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ by its design
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ will inflict losses on 90+% of all consumers who
> are ensnared. from Pyramid Scheme Alert

Alan Kippax (the one alive) was never charged or questioned in Canada
regarding BIM. Even though he was convicted of fraud by the government
of England in another pyramid scheme and in lieu of overwhelming
evidence against him and BIM here in Canada. It is sad that it takes
another tragedy to bring to justice another tragedy. Yet, I find it
incredibly just that at least one more financial scam has come to an
end, although in an unfortunate manner. As for Kippax. I feel no remorse
for him. A loved one dies in his face and he's left alive to bear the
consequences of his crime (not to the full extent, but still) in prison.
How fitting is that for a scammer? (Yes, I am evil.) My questions are,
why are there still so many financial scams out there, right in our
backyards, in this so-called information age? Is our government
deliberately turning a blind eye or are they really that incompetent?
How many more [Madoff cases][] will it take for us to wake up to this
problem?

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If you are like me that keep a detailed trading journal in a blog or in
a computer, then capturing technical analysis charts (assuming you use
TA) is an essential historical record of your trades. I was saving my
charts in JPG format for many years because that's also what my digital
camera used. So I used it without giving much thought. It wasn't until
one day when I realized my saved charts were slightly blurry that I gave
the issue of image format more thought. After some research, I found out
that not all image formats are created equal. Not only do they differ in
compression level, they also differ in their quality and intended use.
This post is intended to summarize my conclusion about why PNG format is
the best for saving stock chart captures. In addition to the popular
JPEG image format, I have often seen other technical analyst bloggers
use GIF to post their charts. As such, I'll compare the 3 formats in
this article. The criteria for judging image format for stock charts are
obviously quality and file size. Quality is definitely what matters the
most because stock charting relies heavily on the points and lines for
comparison and analysis. If you can't figure out the resistance/support,
for example, from looking at the image, then that chart couldn't provide
you with in-depth analysis later. Which would render it useless for the
purpose of reviewing your trades. As for file size, it depends on if
you're posting it online. If that the case, then it's arguably as
important as the quality of the image. Waiting for images to load is an
unnecessary waste of time. Before digging deeper in this topic. I
figured that it's best to just present a real case trading journal
example. Here's what I did for the figures attached below. I captured a
chart of crude oil futures with my trading screen. Moving averages,
channels, volume, and a couple more separate indicators. A pretty
typical setup. The first image is saved in JPG format. It is 213 KB in
size. Click on it to see the full size image. Notice the compression
artifacts. In particular, the distorted colours and pixels. You couldn't
really make out some lines because it's blurred. The second image is in
PNG format. It is only 68 KB in size, a 1/3 of the JPG. You can see that
it's perfectly clear and sharp. If you're interested in more
explanation, continue reading. But be forewarned that this could get
confusing. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics#Comparison_with_other_file_formats">Wikipedia</a>, .PNG images are generally smaller
than GIF but bigger than .JPG. However, PNG images produce sharper
quality than JPG if all else remain equal. Thus, for a clear technical
analysis chart image capture, PNG's file size is smaller than JPG (and
GIF) if the quality and resolution (height and width) are the same. That
is because PNG (and GIF) uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_data_compression">lossless compression</a> technique.
Meaning that the compressed image looks exactly the same as the
original. Whereas JPG uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression">lossy compression</a> technique. Meaning
the compressed image is merely close enough with the original. JPG would
lose out its advantage of smaller file size because it needs to increase
the quality (by reducing compression rate) to keep up with the quality
of PNG. And why the quality setting needs to be high for charts? Because
of the high contrast and non-uniform nature of stock charts. You can
rarely guess what a pixel is like from its neighbours. That is why
lossless image compression is highly preferred. Out of the commonly
supported trading platform export image formats out there, PNG is the
best there is. PNG is also widely supported by web browsers and
operating systems, so it's almost impossible that you will find a
computer that can't read it. In summary, here's a ranking in terms of
file size (for the same resolution and quality of image), #1 being the
best:</p>
<ol>
<li>PNG</li>
<li>GIF</li>
<li>JPG</li>
</ol>
<p>Then a ranking for the quality at the same resolution and file size, #1
being the best:</p>
<ol>
<li>PNG</li>
<li>GIF</li>
<li>JPG</li>
</ol>
<p>(Sorry, I couldn't do a table in this blog) Also note that PNG was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">designed to be an improvement of GIF</a>. So in most cases, PNG beats
GIF. Lastly, there's also BMP bitmap format. Some people may use it
because it's the default for Windows Paint and some other software.
Although, BMP is lossless too, it has no compression at all. For
example, the samples below were 213 KB and 68 KB for JPG and PNG,
respectively, but the BMP file is 3,319 KB for exactly the same image!
Using BMP is a waste of hard drive space for saving stock charts when
you can use PNG for the same image quality. [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After watching the videos below, and from months of observation of this
latest global financial debacle, I am suddenly awashed with a feeling of
hopelessly powerless to this gross unfairness. In which the average,
hard working citizens are pouring money into the pockets of the filthy
and uber rich. If you don't know what I'm talking about here, watch the
video attached below for the tip of the ice berg in this on-going
problem. While Goldman is arguably the best at "legalized stealing" from
the moms and pops, they aren't the only crook on the block. Governments
around the world (not just the U.S.) were handing out money publicly
left and right in the past few months. And many still are. The whole
system is rigged as <a href="http://www.caracommunity.com">Bill Cara</a> has opined countless times in the last
few years. Bill's ingenious move to relocate his operation to the
Bahamas is only starting to shine in these months (to me). In addition
to voting with your ballot (which is useless if the whole system is
rigged), we can vote with our tax money by relocating our financial
operation. However, for those of us that still rely on a day job, this
is not an option. The best I can do right now is to become adequate with
managing our own money instead of depending on the financial salesmen.
This doesn't seem enough for me as the balance of power appears to be
getting worse by the day. Our government grossly tax us on one hand and
hand them out to the rich and well connected in the other. What have
others done/plan to do with regard to this unfair trap us working bees
are stuck in? The first video is Ratigan explaining how Goldman Sachs
made \$3 billions in 3 months (tipped by Stop Investing blog). The
second video is an interview with Michael Moore and Ratigan about where
all these loots are going now.</p>
