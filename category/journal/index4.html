            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Nowadays, computing power is practically free for trading. It does not
take much processing power to trade or chart on your computer. The
situation is even more wasteful for many mechanical traders obligated to
keep their computers on all the time. So what can you do with all that
idling power? Through World Community Grid (non-profit), you can help
develop new cures for diseases or discover affordable solar energy.
According to Wikipedia, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_community_grid">World Community Grid</a> (WCG) is an effort to
create the world's largest public computing grid to tackle scientific
research projects that benefit humanity." By joining WCG and installing
an open-source software, you are enabling your computer's idling cycles
to process data from various research projects as part of a cluster of
computers. From the <a href="http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/stat/viewGlobal.do">WCG statistics page</a>, over half a million users
have signed up. It is one of the three biggest non-profit grid computing
efforts in the world (the other being SETI@home and folding@home). I
tried <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETI@home">SETI@home</a> almost a decade ago to help search for E.T. But it
wasn't until the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home">folding@home</a> project started when grid computing
gained popularity. Tell people that you're leaving your computer on to
search for E.T. and people couldn't hold their laughs at you. But
telling people that you're leaving your computer on to find cures for
diseases ... then all of a sudden, it's philanthropic. The reasons why I
chose to devote my computer resources to WCG instead of the other two
are simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>It offers more than one projects to choose. You can fold proteins,
    find energy efficient material, simulate climate change, etc.</li>
<li>The projects offered have specific, realistic goals.</li>
<li>Projects do get completed (unlike SETI@home, for example, since no
    E.T. has been found yet after 10 years).</li>
<li>New projects are added as older ones finish.</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, that's just my personal choice. Take a look at the three
projects mentioned for more information. In addition, there's <a href="http://itnomad.wordpress.com/2010/05/19/a-better-rice-for-the-world/">an
interview with a researcher using WCG</a>. If you decide that WCG is
right for you, feel free to <a href="%20http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/viewRegister.do?teamID=JQ7WNMDLX1">join Team Traders and start data crunching
together</a>. (Warning: Like any software, use at your own risk)</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been weaning myself away from Microsoft products these past few
years. First to go was Microsoft Outlook. Then Microsoft Office. And
then recently, I am finally rid myself of the last Microsoft product
that I have--Windows XP. I have been using Ubuntu for the past two
months now. Linux is certainly a lot easier to use now than years ago
when Red Hat was the most popular distribution. I installed Ubuntu and
the system was ready to use. No more hunting for linux drivers or
installing packages one by one. Ubuntu was ready for use right off the
bat. The first couple of weeks was awkward as there are many differences
between Ubuntu and Windows. I often find myself searching online to see
how to perform some trivial tasks. Setting up the Ubuntu system to just
the way I wanted took some time and IT skills. But after the initial
learning curve of about a week, I am very satisfied. Both Windows and
Ubuntu have their pros and cons (there are plenty of comparisons online,
so I won't compare them here), I wouldn't say one is better than other.
As a skilled computer user, I am fine either way. The primary use of my
computer is for running my automated strategies and quant programming.
As such, system stability is a top priority for me. Which is why I
decided to try Linux in the first place. So far, Ubuntu hs lived up to
its expectations. I ran the JForex platform non-stop for days in
addition to my regular heavy usage without any hiccup or slowdown.
Having made the switch, I will be sticking with Ubuntu for the following
reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It works.</li>
<li>It is stable.</li>
<li>It is free.</li>
<li>It is fully customizable.</li>
<li>It integrates with other open source software that I use.</li>
<li>I like how it is always up-to-date to fix bugs and security holes.</li>
<li>It runs much better than XP (although that's an unfair comparison as
    XP is old).</li>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Understandably, I will not be posting anything for the next few weeks. I
will be far away from the market as my destination wedding is in the

this page for other trading blogs that I frequently visit. I normally
don't talk about non-trading topics on this trading blog. But seeing
that I'm away for a few weeks, you definitely deserve some explanation
for my disappearance. Let's see if S&amp;P will be above or below 1150 when
I'm back.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been fortunate enough to not have to think about taxes for the
longest time. Unfortunately though, that is because of my long stay in
academia plus a couple of years of a low salary research position. I
didn't have to pay much income taxes, if at all. Things are different
now that I am working in a full time job with a decent pay. I am
reminded of the impact of our high Canadian taxes from the missing chunk
on every paycheck. That is why I am looking into what to do with my RRSP
contribution lately. Last month, I analyzed the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">cost-benefit of a Tax
Free <em>Trading</em> Account</a>. I concluded that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-4/">a TFSA trading account is
not worth my while</a> for the moment. So I will probably just stash my
TFSA contribution in a good old savings account for now. That is not the
case with a RRSP. One big difference that change the whole argument
around with RRSP is that any contribution that I make into it is tax
deductible! I won't go into details here because I hate taxes. Refer to
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_Retirement_Savings_Plan">Wikipedia entry on RRSP</a> if you are unfamiliar with it.
Essentially, I am guaranteed about 30% (or your marginal tax rate) of
"profit" by way of tax refund for the amount of money which I put into
my RRSP account. I don't know about you, but 30% is a massive return for
me! And it's risk free! (Technically it's just a refund of my own money,
but still) The benefit of having a RRSP is obvious. What I have been
pondering about is where should I put my money in my RRSP? As I
discussed in <em><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/">Benefits of trading in a TFSA account</a></em>, there are many
limitations to a self-directed registered account. Although there are
certainly other options than just trading stocks in a registered
account. Here are the options that I have considered.</p>
<ol>
<li>Savings account</li>
<li>Fixed income</li>
<li>Mutual funds</li>
<li>Exchange traded funds</li>
<li>Individual stocks</li>
</ol>
<p>In my next post, I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/ranking-investment-options-for-my-self-directed-rrsp/">rank my preferences for each retirement investment option</a>.</p>
