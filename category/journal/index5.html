            <div class="article-content"> <p>When was the last time that you were working on something and you were
so immersed in it that you have forgotten about the hours that gone by?
That feeling of timelessness while doing something for hours. Not the
type that you're stressed and feel that you don't have enough time to do
a job. I am talking about the other kind of feeling. The positive one.
The feeling that is serene and content. If you know what I'm talking
about, then congratulations! You have found what you're born to do.
There are a handful of activities that I am passionate about. I
sometimes get that zen-like feeling when I am cycling through a mountain
path or snowboarding down a hill. But what I truly like to do is problem
solving. In particular, I find that programming quantitative trading
systems is a perfect outlet for this side of my personality. Programming
is one of the few ways in which you can create something out of nothing.
Very much like a composer or a poet. But unlike those trades, you can
solve practical problems with just your sheer mental capacity by
programming your thoughts into codes. To problem solve, you also need a
source of inspiration. And what better field can there be than the
capital markets. It is basically an ever-changing chess game in which
you are playing against the entire world. Talk about setting a bar high.
As you may have read, I've run into a few <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-to-do-when-life-gets-in-your-way-of-trading/">obstacles with my trading</a>
lately. I need to develop a new trading program to let me regain my
edge. So I got up early this Saturday to program <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/data-scraping-the-toronto-stock-exchange-extracting-3660-companies-data/">my new trading software</a>. Next thing I know, it was 4pm already. It was a blissful
day. And that, is my reason for wanting to trade for a living.</p> </div>

<p><img alt="40 monitors trading workspace" src="/images/img_archive/40montradingdesk.jpg" /></p>
<p>I have no idea how this trader can juggle 40 monitors during his day
trading. I am satisfied with just one 24" monitor on my desk. However,
I'm neither a day trader or a professional trader, so perhaps I'm
missing something?</p>
<p>What do you think of this 40 monitors setup? A dream come true or a

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My stomach felt awkward after dinner last night. Then around 2am, I felt
like I wanted to vomit. Minutes afterward, my previous meal came gushing
out. That was the most awful experience I've ever felt. Even worse than
the time when I crashed into a ditch while going down a steep hill on my
mountain bike... My throat felt burning from the stomach acid. So being
as bright as I am, I drank some milk and some honey water. Not a good
idea. First of all, I <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/food_poisoning/article_em.htm">shouldn't have any dairy or citrus product for
the first day</a> according to eMedicineHealth. Secondly, my stomach
needed rest before I poured more stuff down. So not too long afterward,
I vomitted a second time. By then, it was pretty evident that I have
food poisoning. I could barely standup and felt dizzy. I took a sip of
water to sooth my throat, researched what I should do online, and just
went back to sleep. Geeky, I know. It was faster to just Google it than
find the number and consult the 24-hour telehealth line we have here in
Canada. But I promised myself that if I vomit a third time, I would go
to the hospital. Fortunately, I didn't have to resort to that. The
instructions online actually worked. I took a nap and allowed my stomach
to rest. Then I gradually drank more and more water and mixed in some
soft food to regain my strength. Took me 2 long hours to eat a banana
and a bowl of oatmeal plus water. After a few more hours of sleep, I
feel much better now. I called in sick at work for today and tomorrow
just in case. I'm just going to chill for a day or two. I see that the
forex market is making some impressive moves overnight. I couldn't care
less at this moment.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>RRSP contribution deadline on March 1st is fast approaching. Like most
Canadians, this is pretty much the only time when I give my<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_Retirement_Savings_Plan">Registered
Retirement Savings Plan</a> some attention. Right now, my RRSP balance
stands at \$0. That's right, nothing. I've been putting my money at work
for 10 years trading all sorts of markets but willfully ignoring the
biggest cost to any trader. Taxes. Now that my marginal tax rate is for
the first time running above 30%, and with no tax break in sight, it's
time that I take a hard look at my tax strategies to reduce my trading
costs. Don't worry, this isn't yet another post about RRSP. (But if
you're indeed looking for RRSP information, I point you to a Canadian
personal finance blog, <a href="http://www.milliondollarjourney.com/">MillionDollarJourney</a>) The reason why I
haven't placed money into my RRSP is same as why I don't invest in real
estates. Which is, a lack of liquidity. As the name suggest, RRSP is for
retirement. Here's the problem simplistically put. If I take money out
while I'm still working, I get taxed at my full marginal tax rate for
those money. Even if they were supposed to be capital gain. Thus I
effectively lose my 50% tax discount from my investment capital gain. So
money into my RRSP would effectively be locked in while my salary is
still my main source of income! I don't have a wad of cash where I can
just stash away yet. So that's why my RRSP stands at \$0 this year.
Although I am thinking of opening an RRSP soon... But I digressed. The
fact is, taxes in Canada is ridiculously high. So I need to do something
about it soon. While looking for RRSP information, I came across
Questrade's Tax Free Trading Account. It is a reincarnation of the <a href="http://www.tfsa.gc.ca/">Tax
Free Savings Account</a>. As far as I know, Questrade is the only
discount broker offering this type of account. Basically, it is a
trading account in which there is no income taxes involved and any
profit taken out would not count towards annual income too. Sounds too
good to be true? Here are 3 limitations for a TFSA trading account.</p>
<ol>
<li>Limit of \$5,000 contribution per year</li>
<li>Extra costs for trading the U.S. markets</li>
<li>Cash account only, no margin.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will discuss #2 shortly. But #3 is what matters the most to me as a
trader. No margin means no leverage, no shorting, and no futures and
forex trading. No shorting?! One-way trading is not a good thing for a
trader. This is obviously a ploy to get people to buy, buy, buy. And no
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex trading</a>?! Yet, I can't expect to have my cake and eat it too.
Yes, this TFSA trading thing has strings attached. But. It's tax-free!
That's enough incentive for me to consider incorporating it into my
portfolio. Make no mistake, this will not be my primary, or even
secondary, trading account. My plan is to use it as an
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ultra-conservative</span>
investment vehicle only. It's about time that I replace my abysmal 1%
yield savings account! Before<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade">opening a Questrade TFSA trading
account</a> (affliate link) though, I need to do my homework on Canadian
stocks. Because TFSA is a Canadian government offer, trading U.S.
markets would incur extra costs (a devious way of "Buy Canadian"). As
such, the only cost effective way for me to maximize a TFSA trading
account is to trade TSX and TSX Ventures stocks. This is yet another
item on my to-do list. Come up with a strategy to trade this account
<strong>with minimal risks</strong> (can't stress this enough)using Canadian stocks.
I actually have some ideas already. But I'll save that for another time.
In my next series of posts, I ask a fundamental investment question like
any trader should. Is a \$5000 Questrade TFSA trading account cost
effective? P.S. For more information on Questrade, youngandthrifty.ca
offers a <a href="http://youngandthrifty.ca/questrade-review-2/">review of this discount broker</a>.</p>
