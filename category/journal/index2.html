            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Many people dream of making a cash cow trading program and be set for
life. The reality of the business, which is just like any other
profession, is that you need to be persistent and persevere. You really
need to enjoy the work to be able to keep going at it day after day even
if nothing that you do seems to work at a time. This video by Tim
Harford explains why success starts with failure. It rings with my
previous post on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-secret-to-trading-system-development-is-to-fail-faster/">why the secret to trading system development is to
fail faster</a>.

Harford's three principles of success:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fail a lot.</li>
<li>Fail affordably.</li>
<li>Fail and fix early.</li>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Yes, this is still Quantisan.com. In case anyone is visiting and noticed
the different design. I've made some major changes to the website over
the weekend for both aesthetic and technical reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Professionally designed.</strong> The previous theme was something that I
    hacked together over a weekend. It's actually pretty bad under the
    hood as I had only learned PHP scripting to write that theme. This
    new theme is a minor tweak over a professional framework. It enables
    more flexibility to the page layout. Expect some major changes to
    the front page in the weeks to come as this personal blog transforms
    into a company site.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced computing resource hog.</strong> I disabled a number of Wordpress
    plugin modules as the theme has already taken care of things like
    search engine optimisation.</li>
<li><strong>Optimised page loading time.</strong> The code for the new design is also
    optimised for faster page load times with built-in optimisation of
    javascript and css file loading.</li>
<li><strong>Geographically distributed content delivery network.</strong> As forex is
    a global endeavour, the readers to this blog is quite geographically
    diverse. While the site is hosted in the U.S., I want to ensure the
    readers from Germany and India (8% of my readers) have a smooth
    browsing experience too. The use of a CDN to mirror contents around
    the world makes this possible.</li>
<li><strong>Bad traffic filtering</strong>. A significant traffic on the web is due
    to software crawlers. Some of them post spam comments on my blog or
    copy my copyrighted materials. I added a server-side security
    control service to block all those unwanted traffic. This increases
    security and reduces unnecessary server load.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might have noticed that aside from point #1, which is purely
aesthetic, everything else is done to improve page load time for readers
to this blog. The result is that the new loading time is down to about
4.0 seconds. Whereas the old site took around 8 seconds to load. You
might think this cost a fortune. But it still costs less than most small
websites out there. The old site cost me \$30 <em>per year</em> to run,
including everything from domain name registration to web hosting. The
new total is still only up to \$70 <em>per year</em>. The key to the savings is
that I made use of a free network enhancement service
(<a href="http://www.cloudflare.com">cloudflare.com)</a> and exploited my remote server and network
optimisation knowledge acquired from the long nights of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/vps">administering a
remote trading server</a>. Technology is cheap nowadays. The real values
are in the ability to deliver on that technology to bring about even
greater return. This is what drives everything I do at Quantisan
Systems.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I hope this is a April Fool's joke but it isn't. As shown, the Dukascopy
JForex DEMO platform version 2.13.6 released this week is causing havoc
to my strategy. I tested my contest strategy, which has been running
fine for almost a year, but is now failing left and right. Even though
this is only happening with the DEMO platform (the LIVE platform is a
stable release and is running fine at the moment), the fact that they
published a buggy version for us developers as guinea pigs is upsetting.
JForex developers are clients too, after all. [caption

While cramming for the CFA level 1 exam the past 3 weeks, I can't let go
of the fact that I'm leaving my work out cold on the table. This sense
of urgency feels like every minute that I delay my trading system
development projects, bits of them will fall apart. This weekend I
finished reading through my Schweser study notes from cover to cover, to
cover to cover, and repeat that 3 more times for a total of 5 books.
It's certainly useful and interesting material. But I can't see the
value of cramming for 3 more months to memorize everything in even more
excruciating detail. No term will be without a definition in my head and
no problem will be without a solution on my BA II Plus calculator. Just
so I can say that I passed my level 1 exam on my resume. What the
curriculum offers is information, but what we need more in this world is
wisdom. I stand by my belief that [credibility is as important as
experience and skills][]. However, that doesn't mean that I need to head
for the path most traveled. Why can't I be unreasonable and push my
limit to do what I've always been set out to do. Credibility can be
gained from attaching professional designations to your name, but it can
also be gained from simply achieving results in the real world. So this
morning, before going to work, I took the first baby step in turning
this little hobby of mine into a real business. I registered a business
entity with our government. After 10 years of [trading][], 5 years
[blogging about the market][], and 3 years in [trading system
development][], today is day 1 of Quantisan Systems! And this -- is how
my business got officially started. My plan towards [unreasonable
goals][] in a world of reasons is finally set in motion.
