            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>People that has gone through The Little Schemer might not find this exciting. One of the things that I discovered while patching <a href="http://quantisan.github.com/clatrix/">Clatrix</a> is that implementing clojure.lang.ISeq interface in your custom data structure unlocks the magic of Lisp composition. By enabling primative operators such as <code>first</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>more</code>, <code>cons</code>, higher-level operations such as <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> would just work when operating on your data structure. I find it fascinating that a native Fortran matrix object (through jBLAS) can be made clojury with a few magic operations implemented.</p>
<p>However, getting a <code>deftype</code> implementation of <code>Matrix</code> correct took some effort as these operators are not as simple as they seem.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">ISeq</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="n">IPersistentCollection</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">Object</span> <span class="nf">first</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="n">ISeq</span> <span class="nf">next</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="n">ISeq</span> <span class="nf">more</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="n">ISeq</span> <span class="nf">cons</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Object</span> <span class="n">o</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>For example, say we have a matrix <code>M</code> like so.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">M</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">matrix</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">7</span> <span class="mi">8</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">]]))</span>
<span class="nv">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">M</span>
<span class="nv">A</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="nv">x3</span> <span class="nv">matrix</span>
<span class="nv">-------------</span>
<span class="mf">1.00</span><span class="nv">e+00</span>  <span class="mf">2.00</span><span class="nv">e+00</span>  <span class="mf">3.00</span><span class="nv">e+00</span> 
<span class="mf">4.00</span><span class="nv">e+00</span>  <span class="mf">5.00</span><span class="nv">e+00</span>  <span class="mf">6.00</span><span class="nv">e+00</span> 
<span class="mf">7.00</span><span class="nv">e+00</span>  <span class="mf">8.00</span><span class="nv">e+00</span>  <span class="mf">9.00</span><span class="nv">e+00</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Reducing <code>M</code> across its maps is equivalent to a column-wise operation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">reduce </span><span class="o">#</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map + </span><span class="nv">%1</span> <span class="nv">%2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nv">M</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">12.0</span> <span class="mf">15.0</span> <span class="mf">18.0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Yet for a while this doesn't work because I wasn't careful on my implementation of <code>first</code>. </p>
<p>Consider the case of a 2x2 matrix. A 2x2 matrix is structurally equivalent to a nested vector. Calling <code>first</code> on these would yield:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">first </span><span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]])</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nv">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">first </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">matrix</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]]))</span>
<span class="nv">A</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="nv">x2</span> <span class="nv">matrix</span>
<span class="nv">-------------</span>
<span class="mf">1.00</span><span class="nv">e+00</span>  <span class="mf">2.00</span><span class="nv">e+00</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And for a 3x1 vector matrix, i.e. one-dimensional, it is equivalent to a regular vector.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">first </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="nv">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">first </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">matrix</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]))</span>
<span class="mf">1.0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But here's a tricky bit. What happens during <code>reduce</code> as it keeps recurring <code>next</code> and <code>first</code>?</p>
<p>Let's step this through for <code>(reduce #(map + %1 %2) M)</code>. <code>%1</code> is basically the result so far and <code>%2</code> is the <code>first</code> of the remaining collection to be processed.</p>
<table border="1">
    <tr><th>iteration</th><th>accumulated (%1)</th><th>first (%2)</th><th>remaining</th></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>nil</td><td>[1 2 3]</td><td>[[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]]</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>[1 2 3]</td><td>[4 5 6]</td><td>[[4 5 6] [7 8 9]]</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2, bad</td><td>[5 7 9]</td><td>7</td><td>[[7 8 9]]</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2, good</td><td>[5 7 9]</td><td>[7 8 9]</td><td>[[7 8 9]]</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The problem arises in the second iteration. Calling <code>(rest [[4 5 6] [7 8 9]])</code> returns <code>[[7 8 9]]</code>. However, <code>(matrix [[7 8 9]])</code> is a row vector and <code>(matrix [7 8 9])</code> is a column vector. Both are considered one dimensional. In either case, <code>first</code> of a vector should return the first element, which is a number. Thus at this iteration, <code>reduce</code> breaks because you can't map a sequence with a number, <code>(map + [5 7 9] 7)</code>, to get an accumulated value.</p>
<p>What we want though, is for the second iteration to return <code>[7 8 9]</code> instead because the <em>original</em> matrix is not a vector. Luckily, this particular problem has been solved by my colleague <a href="https://github.com/antoniogarrote">Antonio Garrote</a> when he <a href="https://github.com/forward/incanter-BLAS">did this in Java a year ago</a> by keeping a predicate field signifying is <em>this</em> matrix supposed to be vector or not.</p>
<p>So there you have it. If you find yourself needing to implement <code>deftype</code> to build your own data structure in Clojure. Do consider implementing <code>clojure.lang.ISeq</code> to leverage high-level Clojure functions but be careful about those seemingly simplistic primitive operators.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My definition of a statistical platform is that it is a glue that ties orthogonal data analysis functions together. Take R for instance, it is a platform-as-application. You fire up R and everything is accessible to you. However, all the packages only work on top of R.</p>
<p>Python, on the other hand, take a platform-as-libraries approach. A basic data analaysis setup is to <code>pip install Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib</code>. High-level libraries, such as scikit-learn and pandas, are built on top of these. It is somewhat more flexible for picking and choosing but the dependency is still a tree-like structure between some packages.</p>
<p>Then there's Incanter.</p>
<p>You don't like to use Parallel Colt for your matrices? Here, try <a href="https://github.com/forward/incanter-BLAS">this BLAS drop-in replacement</a> and everything would just work with 10x speed. </p>
<p>Much of this flexibility is due to earlier design choices by Liebke et al. to leverage Clojure's idiom that "it is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures."</p>
<p>The thing is, I think we're only scratching the surface. Excuse me while I dream for a minute.</p>
<p>Say instead of jBLAS, you want to use CPU/GPU hybrid instead. Suppose you can just do a <code>(use 'incanter-magma)</code> and your Incanter code would just run with <a href="http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/software/index.html">MAGMA</a> (via <a href="http://matthewrocklin.com/">Mathew Rocklin</a>) under the hood without any other change.</p>
<p>Taking this idea of interfacing libraries into a hypothetical use case. Imagine that you cleaned and structured your data on Hadoop using <a href="http://cascalog.org/">Cascalog</a> and is looking to analyse this dataset. You start your Incanter session to pull in your data <code>(use 'incanter-cascalog)</code>. Write some Incanter script to interrogate this dataset but find the data is still too big for your laptop. So you <code>(use 'incanter-storm)</code> to make use of distributed processing instead. Incanter would then flow data directly from Cascalog to <a href="http://storm-project.net/">Storm</a> inside your cluster.</p>
<p>For your results, you find JFreeChart limiting so you <code>(use 'incanter-c2)</code> to spiff up your visualisations with <a href="http://keminglabs.com/c2/">C2</a> all while not changing a single line of your Incanter script.</p>
<p>Instead of the star-like dependency of R and its packages, or the tree-like structure for Python and its packages, Incanter could be an interface to stand-alone libraries encapsulated by an application for the user.</p>
<p>Incanter, the library, could be modules that transform data into standard Incanter-compatible data structures to and from external libraries. Incanter, the application, could be a domain specific language, a client, and a in-REPL package manager.</p>
<p>Another benefit to this is that it helps to mitigate the developer shortage problem for Incanter too by making use of external, stand-alone libraries.</p>
<p>I call this platform-as-interface.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>That's the thing that gets under my skin about R. For example, why do I need to use <code>do.call</code> on a list but <code>apply</code> for data frame? Not only that, the two functions have entirely different names and signatures (edit: this is a bad example, see Joshua's explanation in the comment). I find that a lot of R is just a matter of memorising what to do under which condition. You can't simply guess or deduce what to do like a sane programming language would enable. I know that many solutions are just a Google search away, but I am not comfortable with the awkwardness of the language.</p>
<p>Having said that, I've been using R reluctantly for a few years. I try to avoid it as much as possible. But there's just no other statistical platform that's so easy to be productive. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/Incanter">tried Incanter for a while</a> but it doesn't seem that well suited for exploratory analysis as I usually end up writing functions up from scratch. More recently I played with <a href="http://www.julialang.org">Julia</a> briefly. Although it is too bleeding edge as there isn't even a release version yet.</p>
<p>As much as I don't like R the language, the R platform and its package repertoire are incomparable at the moment. We did a bit of ggplot today at work. With the help of <a href="http://oobaloo.co.uk/">my coworker</a>, it only took a few minutes to hook R with our Hadoop cluster to pull some data and produce the graphs that we wanted. In comparison, Incanter's charts are pretty too but not very customisable. D3.js is very customisable but not quick to use at all. Then there's Julia, which can't do more than a bar or line chart for now.</p>
<p>I haven't mentioned the other big contender, Python + Numpy + Scipy + Panda + PyPy + Matplotlib. I tried some of that too some time ago, but didn't get far with it. Come to think of it, I wrote <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/its-an-open-buffet-in-a-small-business">a similar babble like this</a> a year ago ... </p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just migrated this blog from a self-hosted Wordpress site to a Pelican statically generated blog. It took me a whole weekend to do it because I have almost 600 posts. Much is still broken at the moment but at least the site seems presentable so I pushed it through. The fixes will just have to wait.</p>
<p>I considered using Jekyll as it appears to be the most popular static site generator. A look at its github page though shows no patch has been made for months. Development on Jekyll appears to have paused for some reason. Furthermore, I didn't have much luck getting <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp">exitwp</a>, which is a wordpress xml to jekyll importer, to gracefully parse my many custom posting tags. I also gave <a href="http://www.ruhoh.com">Ruhoh</a> a quick trial, but it also relies on exitwp to import wordpress posts.</p>
<p>Then I found that <a href="http://doc.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> had its own importer tool using <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">pandoc</a>, which I tested works much better for the non-standard tags in my posts.</p>
<p>In any case, here are the steps I took to migrate to Pelican.</p>
<ol>
<li>Export Wordpress into a XML file</li>
<li>transfer comments to Disqus</li>
<li>install Pelican 3.0.0 dev build</li>
<li>use pelican-import to convert the XML file into markdown posts</li>
<li>moved some posts around into its directory/category</li>
<li>use Textmate to do a bunch of batch fixes</li>
<li>configure Pelican and made a Makefile</li>
<li><del>install ghp-import</del> rolled my own gh-pages script into Makefile</li>
<li>customised a <a href="https://github.com/Quantisan/pelican-svbtle">pelican theme</a></li>
<li>setup Github for custom domain</li>
<li>updated DNS</li>
</ol>
<p>After all of that, this site is now <a href="https://github.com/Quantisan/www.quantisan.com">hosted and served on github</a>.</p> </div>
