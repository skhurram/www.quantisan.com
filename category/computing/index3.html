            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
Cascalog is an abstraction library on top of Cascading [for writing
MapReduce jobs][]. Since the Cascalog library is maturing, the Twitter
guys (core committers) have been building features around it so that
it's not just an abstraction for Cascading. One of which is
[Cascalog-checkpoint][]. It is a small, easy-to-use, and very powerful
little add-on for Cascalog. In particular, it enables fault-tolerant
MapReduce topologies. Building Cascading/Cascalog queries can be
visualised as assembling pipes to connect a flow of data. Imagine that
you have Flow A and B. Flow B uses the result from A along with other
bits. Thus, Flow B is dependent on A. Typically, if a MapReduce job fail
for whatever reason, you simply fix what's wrong and start the job all
over again. But what if Flow A takes hours to run (which is common for a
MR job) and the error happened in Flow B? Why re-do all that processing
for Flow A if we know that it finished successfully? By using
Cascalog-checkpoint, you can *stage* intermediate results (e.g. result
of Flow A) and failed jobs can automatically pickup from the last
checked point. An obvious thing to do but not something I've seen done
in Hadoop. At least not as easy as this:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1915638.js?file=ccl-checkpoint-sample1.clj"></script>
See [Sam Ritchie's post on cascalog-checkpoint][] for more examples. Of
course, you need to coerce your flows such that output from Flow A can
be read by Flow B. However, this is almost trivial via
Cascalog/Cascading. As this notion of mix and match pipes and flows is a
fundamental concept in Cascalog/Cascading. With so many choices of
abstraction frameworks for coding MapReduce on Hadoop, I feel sorry for
anyone using vanilla Java for writing MapReduce besides the most
simplest or recurring jobs.

<p>First of all, his solutions looked much cleaner <a href="/eureka-moment-on-design-patterns-for-functional-programming/">than mine</a>. Then over
the weekend I was able to incorporate his 3 algorithms into my program.
I ran a few benchmarks and here are the average of 2 tests using a
dataset of 28,760 items.</p>
<ul>
<li>My algorithm. Elapsed time: 68372.026532 msecs.</li>
<li>Kevin's solution #1. Elapsed time: 156.940976 msecs.</li>
<li>Kevin's solution #2. Elapsed time: 60.165483 msecs.</li>
<li>Kevin's solution #3. Elapsed time: 296.162042 msecs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total ownage. That's what I like about sharing my
work; once in a blue moon, a reader drops by and generously show
me how I can improve a solution 1,000 times! Now the ball is in my hands
to understand what he has done and improve myself. Collaborating and
learning, that's why I open source.</p>
<p>Update: I've done some more digging and it seems that one of the reasons for the drastic improvement in performance is due to the use of <a href="http://clojure.org/transients">transients</a> in the built-in functions. Lesson of the day, leverage the language's inherent optimization by staying with core data structures and functions as much as possible.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Understanding design patterns for object-oriented programming made my
life easier as a Java programmer. So I have been looking for a
comparable book for functional programming ever since my sojourn into
this age-old paradigm. It looks as though <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2930277/functional-programming-equivalent-of-design-patterns-book">I'm not the only one
looking</a> too. But the thing is, I think I've just had a revelation of
sort.</p>
<p>There is one and only one guideline to designing functional
architectures -- Keep it simple. Simple as in keeping your functions
having a single purpose only. Simple as in work with the data directly and
don't conjure unnecessary intermediaries. Simple, as elaborated by Rich
Hickey in his talk, <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a>. Much of this is conveyed in Bloch's Effective Java:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">item</span> <span class="err">\#</span><span class="mi">5</span> <span class="err">\–</span> <span class="n">Avoid</span> <span class="n">creating</span> <span class="n">unnecessary</span> <span class="n">objects</span>

<p>As such, there is no design pattern book for functional programming. I didn't get that earlier this year. But something clicked recently. During the past few months, I've been doing some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/ive-quit-my-day-job-and-moved-to-the-uk-to-do-this-full-time/">consulting and open source projects</a> solving algorithmic problems with Clojure.</p>
<p>One of the problems in a project that I was faced with this week is calculating the occurrence of each distinctive element within a list of elements. Say we have a list, <code>coll = ("orange", "bottle", "coke", "bottle")</code>. The output would be something like <code>[("orange", "bottle", "coke") (1 2 1)]</code> </p>
<p>This is my first solution.</p>

<p>The specs are not exactly as I described but the concept remains. What I
did is to use tail calls (it's supposed to be fast, isn't it?) to
aggregate each counter to produce a vector of counts. Then I map each
pair of fragment with its corresponding count to generate a final output
collection. Sounds overly complicated, doesn't it?</p>
<p>This is the first warning of a bad functional design. For a collection of 30,000 items,
this function took 11 minutes to compute on my notebook. This looks like
a good place to exploit the parallel nature of this problem.</p>
<p>Specifically, the counting of each fragment is independent of other
fragments. Thus, there's no need for the program to wait for one
fragment to finish to process the next. I simplified the program to
remove this inherent assumption of procedural processing. Here is the
gist of the refactored code where each function only does one job. Since
the processing are modularised, I can parallelize the algorithm easily
with the use of pmap instead of map on the last line as shown below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">match-count</span>
<span class="s">&quot; Given key, k, returns number of occurrences of k in collection, coll.</span>

<p>I've split the first function into 3 functions (2 shown here). As Hickey
said in his talk, simplifying can often produce more, not less,
functions. Yet, the program is not only easier to read and runs in less
than a minute. An order of magnitude faster! There are still lots for me
to learn. I want to find more challenging projects to push my own
limits. But rather than solving arbitrary problems, I prefer to tackle
real-world challenges. So if you know of anyone that can benefit from
collaborating with a functional developer to build robust and scalable
software, please pass along <a href="mailto:paul@quantisan.com">my contact</a>.</p>
