            <div class="article-content"> <p>Testing is arguably the single most important aspect of trading system
development. You can't tell how well an idea works unless you test it
out. [Testing can also help you identify weaknesses or strengths in your
model][]. The downside to testing is that it takes time to churn through
those gigabytes of data. Backtesting is inherently a linear process. You
feed in your tick data into your algorithm and expect some actions. You
can't really make use of fork/join to let other threads steal from the
process queue as the later process depends on results from the earlier
calculations. However, often times than not, you're interested in
testing many variations of a strategy. This is where MapReduce comes
into play. MapReduce is a Google software framework. It is inspired by
the map and reduce functions ubiquitous in functional programming. They
are as common as for-loops in the Java world. The <em>map</em> function
partitions an input into smaller problems and run them concurrently,
e.g. each of the strategy's variant is executed on a node. The <em>reduce</em>
function takes the results from all the nodes and aggregate them to get
an output, e.g. back-test results from each strategy. Having used
functional programming for some time now, using map/reduce is very
natural for me. Where my knowledge falls short is in implementing a
distributed infrastructure for running these map and reduce with massive
scaling beyond my own multi-core computer. It just so happens that
Amazon AWS has a hosted Hadoop PaaS. Where Hadoop is the Apache's
framework for MapReduce. Hardware, check. Framework, check. This will be
the ~~first~~ second system that I'll be working on in my goal to build
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/towards-a-broker-agnostic-trading-system/">a complete trading R&amp;D platform</a>. Expect some technical discussions
in the coming months as I work my way through. Now, where should I
start...</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The first generation of my trading system uses a broker's proprietary
script on that same broker's platform. The second generation of my
trading system uses a generic programming language on another broker's
platform. I am now working on the third generation of my trading system.
It is language-agnostic, platform-agnostic, and broker-agnostic. Why?
Because designing trading systems is as much about creativity as the
science. An artist would not limit themselves to a defined toolset. I
want to be free to use whatever tools are necessary to get the job done
efficiently and being able to try new things as technologies evolve.
Having a broker-agnostic system frees me from being locked into any
particular broker. Conversely, I could use one system to gather data and
trade from multiple brokers for the best execution prices. Yes, this is
over-engineering for a small entity like myself. But heck, this is
something that I enjoy building. So why not?</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>One of the few benefits of working for myself is that I don't need to
worry about compatibility with legacy systems. I am free to use whatever
open source tools to get the job done well. The downside to this is that
there are so many technologies out there that it's hard to choose the
right ones for the job. To give you a sense of what I meant, here are
some of the topics that I have either tried or seriously considered in
the past year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming languages: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/java/">Java</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/python/">Python</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/R">R</a>, C#, F#, Scala,
    Clojure, Haskell.</li>
<li>Data storage: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/from-object-oriented-programming-to-object-oriented-design/">HDF5</a>, CSV, Binary, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB,
    MonetDB, Redis, HBase.</li>
<li>Cloud server: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/amazon-ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>, Microsoft Azure, [Google App
    Engine][], Rackspace Cloud, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/vps/">plain old VPSs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Programming language choices are important because they sit at the
bottom of a technology stack. Most of the work that I do are built on
using them. For a long while, I settled on using a combination of Java,
Python, and R. I prototype small ideas in Python. Implement production
code in Java. And perform analysis in R. I discussed why <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/data-analysis-with-r-using-the-right-tool-for-the-right-task/">use the right
tool for the right task</a> a year ago. By the end of my previous
project, I am finding that the popular development triplet of Java,
Python, and R, is not ideal for a solo-operation. Seeing that I have
more time on my hands because I am using QTD to trade for me now, I am
taking a break this summer to expand my knowledge and learn new
technologies. Some of the technologies that I am experimenting with
includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>an in-memory data store for instantaneous and persistent tick data</li>
<li>parallel programming for concurrent processing with no locks</li>
<li>mathematically intuitive algorithm implementations using high order
    functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't mind me as I help myself in this open buffet of technologies.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If I am to offer only one advice with regard to developing trading
systems then this is it -- fail faster. The sad truth to trading is that
there is no magical system that can guarantee profitability
indefinitely. A reason top firms like Renaissance Technologies employ
hundreds of PhDs and is <a href="https://www.renfund.com/vm/jobs.vm">still actively hiring</a> is because one can
never reach the end of the rainbow in trading. A system can always be
made better or made obsolete. In fact, you need to stay ahead of the
curve as competitions are like vultures that will eat away your game if
you don't keep moving. Not to mention the changing dynamics of the
market itself is a moving target. As such, you simply need to keep
innovating. My way of innovating boils down to executing five cyclical
steps. Conceptualising, implementing, testing, measuring, and analysing,
over and over again. In essence, my innovation methodology is a
simulated annealing process that might or might not eventually lead to a
breakthrough. I do this because:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am intelligent but I am not a genius. As such, I don't expect
    myself to make leaps and bounds with regular sparks of genius.
    Instead, I take small steps. Adding a 1% yield to your system is
    extremely difficult. Adding 0.01% is a lot easier. Adding 0.0001% is
    almost pedantic. So I aim for achieving smaller improvements and do
    it hundreds of times over a development cycle.</li>
<li>My view of the world is not absolute. In fact, I am more often wrong
    than right. So it follows that most of my ideas don't have all the
    pieces right. Thus, it is inherent that I need to polish my ideas
    through trials and errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Failure is inevidentable when developing trading systems. It is part of
the process. You come up with an idea, implement it, test it, find out
why it isn't up to your expectation, and then make it better. So the
quicker you can fail and learn from it, the quicker you can discover
something useful.</p>
