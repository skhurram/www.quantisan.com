            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>We know that prices can go up or down. We also know that the quality of
these ups and downs can be very smooth or very choppy. As such, it's not
surprising that the trend and volatility of a market form the two
universal characteristics of a price action. No matter which market you
trade, the trend and volatility of the prices will influence your
trading and P&amp;L. That can be both good and bad as volatility is a double
edged sword. A fast paced moving market can rain down gold on you or it
can burn your cash away. Most of the time, it's the latter case.
Consequently, there are many ways traders adapt to changing volatility
in the market. You can tailor your trading strategy, change trading
timeframe, switch market entirely, or manage your risk accordingly, for
examples. In this post, I'd like to give an example for the use of a
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">statistically-derived forex position size table</a> to fit with market
volatility. The problem with market volatility is that it's hard to
notice. As opined by <a href="http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/10/jump-in-stock-market-volatility-and-its.html">Dr. Steenberger</a>, "many traders will adapt to
directional changes quicker than they adapt to shifts in volatility."
The art of identifying market conditions is not discussed in this post.
But obviously, if there is a way to build in an inherent way to manage
your risks based on market volatility, you will have built yourself a
safety net. That is the logic behind my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">statistically-derived forex
position sizer</a>. It's a
data-driven tool to impose an inherent safety net in your trading. What
it does is simple. Here's what it boils down to:</p>
<ol>
<li>It finds the recent 2 sigma value (i.e., a statistical measure of
    volatility, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">see wiki</a>) of each major currency pairs.</li>
<li>It calculates the maximum position size for each pair using the 2
    sigma value.</li>
<li>Then it converts the number to correspond with your account currency
    based on a real-time currency exchange rate for each trading pair.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, a table such as <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">this one I published for
forex</a> can give you a
real-time guideline to the maximum position size you should take given
your risk appetite. One shortcoming with this approach is that while you
may limit your loss during a volatile market, you are also limiting your
potential gain. But this is where the old saying, "let your profit run
and cut your losses short" applies. One solution is to simply add to
your winning trades, according to your trading setups, of course. That
way, when the market moves in your favour or you get confirmation on
your setup, you can increase the position size responsibly without
stretching your principal. By now, it's probably obvious that the use of
such a tool is not, and should not, meant to be a solution to changing
market volatility. It is merely a convenience tool to serve as one of
the many that a trader has at his/her disposal. Nevertheless, I find the
table to be very convenient for me because I don't have to worry about
calculating the position sizes manually on each trade. Trading is tough
enough already, so I like to develop <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/">tools</a> that can make my life
ever so slightly easier.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>In 2008, I spent a few good months <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">developing strategies</a> in
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/easylanguage/">TradeStation</a> full-time for the index futures. Now after a full year
of break in development, I am starting to devote more and more time in
quantitative finance research again. In hindsight, the biggest
shortcoming with my previous strategies is that they are not
discriminating enough. Using an analogy from robotics (my specialty),
some of the most basic robots are great because they can do one task,
and one task only, especially well. Those developers that are too
ambitious in trying to conjure a jack-of-all-trade robot typically fail
miserably. Our current technology simply isn't sufficient for anything
more than a specialized automation. Much is the same in developing
automated trading. With my limited resources and skills, my goal is to
build simple automated systems that can do one job only and do it damn
well. Once that can be achieved, it's only a matter of concatenating all
these individual systems to exploit more and more opportunities.
Therefore, the new plan which I'll follow for development are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify a recurring profitable scenario in the market</li>
<li>Isolate the conditions which would yield a high probability of such
    scenario happening</li>
<li>Program the findings into my platform</li>
<li>Run backtests to calculate the expected profit (probability *
    reward/risk)</li>
<li>Tweak and debug</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, remember this: <em>It's not a matter of the number of trades
you take, it's a matter of being as picky as you can in only playing the
best of the best trades you can find</em>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After trying <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-automated-trading-development-platforms-for-beginner-to-advanced-traders/">TradeStation, Ninja Trader</a>, and RightEdge for trading,
I've gone back to my engineering root and is starting to explore with
MatLab as my quantitative finance tool and eventually as my platform for
an automated trading system.</p>
<p>I gave up on TradeStation last year because it just didn't fit my style.
Then I gave both Ninja Trader and RightEdge a quick spin (a few days)
and found that I need to learn C# to really make use of them. After
procrastinating for a couple of months in learning C#, I realize I
don't have the time to learn a new language just to start working on a
quant tool.</p>
<p>So after some wandering, I stumbled upon MatLab again. In particular, I
found out that there's a <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/finance/">Financial Toolbox in MatLab</a> that seem to
have many of the basic functions that I need. Furthermore, people have
used MatLab as an automated trading platform. Since I've been using
MatLab as an engineering tool for several years, I wouldn't have to
start learning from scratch. Furthermore, because of its academic
popularity, there are many existing analytical functions which I can
build my future work upon.</p>
<p>Isn't it silly of me? I really should have considered MatLab earlier
because it's so well known. I've just always associated MatLab as an
analytical tool but never thought that it can be used as an automated
trading platform too.</p>
<p>Anyway, my short term plan is to brush up on my MatLab by playing with
the financial tools and trying some basic stuff up. I have scheduled
8:00 - 9:00 pm every night to do this with another 10 min afterward to
write a brief lesson summary. Let's see how this goes.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Over the weekend, I've dug into a few more automated trading development
platforms. There are certainly <a href="http://www.elitetrader.com/so/">many out there</a>. This condensed
comparison is based on my own experience, online research, or reading
through their documentation. I only included the ones which I find to be
the best for each different level of <strong>independent</strong> developers. We'll
start with the most basic and work our way up the food chain.</p>
<h4>TradeStation</h4>

problem</a>.</p>
<p>Who I think it's for: Medium to high programming background. Low cost
(free to develop or \$50/month for trading), good for independent
developer that has a long development time.</p>
