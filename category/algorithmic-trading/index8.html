            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've just spent an absurd amount of time figuring out how to parse
millisecond times into R. (It's standard practice to timestamp tick data
with milliseconds timing in a flat data file.) Turns out that there are
two problems that I faced. One being that there is a almost-hidden,
footnote option in the <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/strptime.html">strptime( ) function</a> (for converting
characters to POSIX) in which it describes using <code>format = "%H:%M%OS"</code>
instead of <code>"%H:%M:%S"</code> to parse fractional seconds. However, the second,
and what's actually the one that's wasted much my time, is the fact that
R <strong>ignores</strong> milliseconds in printing by default! For example, here's
an output for the POSIXct representation of the integer value
1286564400.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s">&quot;2010-10-08 15:00:00 EDT&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So even though I figured how to represent millisecond times in R a few
hours ago, I never knew I did it simply because R is not printing the
output that I wanted on screen every time I tried! After a couple hours
of searching, trying, and frustrating, here's the one-liner command that
solved my problem.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">options</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">digits</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">secs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>which changes the options of the display and thus I can see the
following output from the same input as above.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="s">&quot;2010-10-08 15:00:00.344 EDT&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I guess that's why they say <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2010/06/learning-r.html">R has a steep learning curve</a>! Yes, it is
very powerful and flexible. But there are limited standards and the
documentations are all over the place because it's a mish mash of
user-contributed packages!</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I ported <a href="http://engineering-returns.com/tsi/">Engineering Return's Trend Strength Index</a> to JForex as my
first practice to writing custom indicators in JForex. Frank's code in
TradeSignal consists of 9 lines. My JForex code? 191. This is my first
custom indicator in JForex. It will also be the last. A compiled
programming language such as Java is not the most convenient to use for
data analysis. The lack of interactivity because of the step of
compilation is one obstacle to fluent data explorations. Secondly, the
language itself is more cumbersome because of its generality. Java is
used to build all sorts of applications. Contrary to something like
MatLab, in which it is purposely built to work with numbers. I miss <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/starting-to-use-matlab-for-quantitative-finance/">the
days when I have my license for MatLab</a>. However, being forced away
from MatLab might not be a bad thing. As much as I've become accustomed
to it, MatLab isn't without its flaws. But I won't bash it in this post.
What I actually want to talk about is R. The rage these days in
statistical data analysis is in R (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29">Wiki entry on R</a>). I've done
some research and testing, R is really as good as they say it is (see
past publications in <a href="http://www.rinfinance.com/">R/Finance conference</a><a href="http://probability.ca/cran/doc/contrib/Farnsworth-EconometricsInR.pdf"></a>). You will get to see
some real examples in financial time series data analysis in R later in
this blog once I have some publishable results. This will no doubt take
some time as I am learning yet another new programming language (thus
the lack of posts this week). The plan from now on is to use R to play
with the data. Then once the algorithm is finalized, I will either port
it to Java (JForex) for deployment or <a href="http://www.rforge.net/rJava/">embed the R environment in
Java</a> for live trading.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I despise sellers of trading robots making misleading promises like
"doubling your money every month". They are nothing more than snake oil
salesmen exploiting on the greed and ignorance of others. Yet I am
finding myself in a similar situation lately. Ever since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">my interview
at Dukascopy</a> about my JForex automated trading contest win, I seem to
have established a persona for being able to generate 45%+ return per
month using my strategy. Despite my constant reiteration that this is
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/number-one-with-40-percent-return-in-a-month-so-am-i-rich-yet-not-really/">merely a lucky result in a risk-free game</a>, I am still getting
inquiries from people interested in following my trading signals. In
another attempt to rein in expectations, consider this chart of my
contest demo account balance for this month.</p>
<p><img alt="September 2010 JForex contest balance" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-09-27-contestbalance.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, my strategy doubled the account within days. However, it
also lost half of its paper value plus some more soon afterward. As it
stands now, my September strategy will not be in the top 10 for this
month.</p>
<p>If I haven't mentioned this embarassing negative return, you wouldn't
have noticed it, would you? That's the thing with trading contest and
those snake oil trading robots, we hear a lot about them when somebody
win. But what happens to those same people when they aren't winning or
the countless other unfortunate followers lost money?</p>
<p>This reminds me of the lottery system. Our perception of the probability
of winning the lottery is drastically distorted because we hear about
the winnings so much while neglecting the fact that there are millions
of losers out there.</p>
<p>The fact is, most of the seemingly impressive trading robots out there
will not last for the long term. The only reason that I have won three
times out of the five months is that I change my strategy's parameters
in expectation of the future month's market condition. That expection is
based on my own market analysis from my real trading. It isn't something
that can be readily quantified yet.</p>
<p>The way I see it, the only way in which others can exploit my success is
to buy my real secret trading system, which is, perhaps unfortunately,
my brain.</p> </div>
