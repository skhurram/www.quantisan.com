            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Java is the programming language that I have known and used the longest.
I learned Java as part of the curriculum when I was in my first year of
undergraduate study. Although reluctant at first, I can still recall the
joy I felt switching over from C++. No more garbage collection! That was
ten years ago. I haven't done any real programming in the last few years
as my engineering work has become higher and higher level. Although I
have maintained my hobby in developing automated trading strategies and
quantitative analysis, much of that work are mere child's play compared
to what I have done and much forgotten. Lately, words such as "<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/from-object-oriented-programming-to-object-oriented-design/">code
smell</a>", "design pattern", and the likes are creeping back into my
world as I am <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-to-lose-focus-by-defining-what-i-want-from-trading/">comitting myself</a> to pursuit my esoteric fascination in
financial engineering. The first step, research, was a few months of
testing the possibilities to decide what I should use. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">Different
markets</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">different brokers</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/comparing-trading-api-from-6-online-forex-brokerages/">different platforms</a>, and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">different technology</a>. I decided to study the foreign exchange market
through <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy's JForex platform</a> using Java. Although ideally, I
would be using Oanda and Python... But I'm not prepared to cough out
\$600 per month for Oanda's API. Some of the other tools that I use are
<a href="http://rapid-i.com">RapidMiner</a> and <a href="http://weka.wikispaces.com/">Weka</a>. Both of which offer a Java API. Having
learned JForex and programmed a few strategies already, I have tested
the water enough. For the past few weeks, I have been taking steps to
move to the next level of my development. However, as I play with
programming more and more, I realize that I am fundamentally outdated in
my programming skills. There were no <em>interface</em> when I learned Java.
Neither was there <em>hashset</em> and <em>annotation</em>. As such, before doing
anything else, I am just going to pause for the next two weeks while I
am travelling in Hong Kong and catch up on my Java knowledge (I just
realized that they don't publish those Teach Yourself \&lt;insert topic>
in 24 Hours book anymore. The Head First series seem to be the craze
nowadays). My goal is to devour a Java book in the 15-hour flight. Let's
see if I still got it after ten years.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>There is only two more trading days left in the April <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/">Dukascopy</a>
JForex Strategy Contest. I am currently ranked 6th. But there's a fierce
fight for my spot. I've been moving between 6th and 8th all week even
though I haven't made any trade. The other people are putting on big
bets hoping to squeeze in a top 6. Why? According to the winning prize
structure, the 4th to 6th winners will each receive \$1,000. Whereas the
7th to 10th will each receive \$500 only. With my current account
standing at \$120,032 (20% gain) this month, it is quite viable for
others to try to take my spot. See the table below for the top 10
standings as of this writing.</p>
<p><img alt="April standing 2 days before close" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-29-contestranking.png" /></p>
<p>My options are to either fire up my strategy to make more trades or do
nothing. The risk in running my strategy again is that I might lose
money and make myself even less competitive. My strategy's working
timeframe is in hours, so there isn't much room for error. As such, I
feel that with only two days of trading left, time is not on my side.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I will probably lose out my 6th spot as I am not far
away from others behind me. So if I do nothing, I will most likely end
up 7th or 8th and lose half the prize money.</p>
<p>After pondering about this briefly, I've decided to do nothing. The odds
are just too much against me. I have seen too many people in this
month's contest risking to move up from a good rank only to expose
themselves too much and lose out of the top 10 completely.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I found out that the competing strategy in the Dukascopy JForex Strategy
Contest doesn't need to be 100% automatic! According to <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/forex/jforex/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=4771&amp;sid=2ff0fd1b7645652d5f57821451586b08">Contest Support
in the official forum</a>, I can set parameters like take profit target,
stop loss, and long-only or short-only trades. That make this contest
substantially easier to program as I can implement a semi-automatic
strategy, which is what I prefer in my real trading. The problem with
building an automated trading system is that market conditions change
frequently and without notice. Thus, it takes more than a few lines to
program a consistently profitable system to filter out undesirable
conditions. As I discussed before, because all winners in this contest
have to publish their source codes, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reading-the-fine-print-for-dukascopy-jforex-strategy-contest/">I don't want to spend too much time
on this contest</a>. Now that I know I can trade semi-automatically in
this contest. I can just do my analysis manually and then use the
strategy to execute trades when I so desire. That is exactly like <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-is-your-trading-process/">my
real trading process</a> as illustrated before. As you can imagine, I am
very happy of this news. I don't need to scratch my head anymore to
build a new strategy for next month's contest. I programmed and tested
several new ideas in the past 2 weeks but haven't found anything better
than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/">my existing strategy</a>, which has been doing well in April. This
Dukascopy JForex Strategy Contest has been a great incentive for me to
become familiar with JForex. As I intend to use it for my <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">real trading
at Dukascopy</a> (open an account with this affiliate link to receive 35%
rebate on commissions) later this year, this is a win-win situation for
me as I learn the API and possibly win some prize money at the same
time.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am building my real JForex automated trading system one feature at a
time. The idea is to automate some of my most fundamental trading
techniques on JForex so that I can trade forex semi-automatically on
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a>. I am starting off here with a simple stop management
strategy. In a nutshell, once the market price moves in your favour
equidistant from your original stop loss, this strategy moves the stop
to breakeven. For example, if I go long EURUSD at 1.3500 with a stop at
1.3400 (100 pips stop). Then if the price breaks above 1.3600 (100 pips
profit), the strategy moves the stop to breakeven. This is a simplistic
implementation of the saying that "never let profits turn into losses".
