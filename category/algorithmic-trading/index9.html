            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just spent the last few hours looking into Google App Engine to use it
for trading. Google App Engine (GAE) is a cloud computing development
and hosting platform for web applications. GAE is similar to the
well-known Amazon EC2 service but it is also very different. The main
difference between GAE and EC2 is that GAE is not as flexible as EC2 but
it is a lot easier to develop on. Think of it like using C++ (EC2) to
write your own trading platform to using EasyLanguage on TradeStation or
MQL on Metatrader (GAE). Another advantage for using Google App Engine
is that it is free! Well, to a certain extent. It is free for a limited
monthly usage. However, Google's free quota is known to be very generous
(think Gmail) and this is no exception. Based on the numbers, it looks
comparable to a typical \$20/month virtual private server (VPS) hosting
package. My guess is that you can run a decent personal quant program on
it if you keep the resources for yourself (private use). For more
information on the free quota, you can read the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas.html">current GAE quota</a>
web page or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Engine">Wikipedia page for GAE</a>. You might be wondering how
did I spend a few hours just reading on GAE? The answer is that I've
done a brief research, planning, and assessment to see how GAE can be
put to use in terms of quantitative analysis for automated and
discretionary trading. Without going through all of my notes and logic,
here's the gist of my conclusion.</p>
<h2>For Automated Trading</h2>
<p>Since GAE is also a SDK, it has a restricted programming API. You can't
just plug in any custom library of your own (i.e. your broker's API)
into your program. That is its advantage and its disadvantage.
Furthermore, GAE only support HTTP and HTTPS. So you can't open a socket
for your connection either. These limitations won't be changing anytime
soon as GAE is designed to be like that for security reasons. Basically,
there's no way for your web application on GAE to connect with your
broker for trading. So much for that idea.</p>
<h2>For Discretionary Trading</h2>
<p>Things look brighter for discretionary trading though. A big bonus with
using Google App Engine is that it supports the Google Finance API.
Google Finance offers free real-time stock quotes. Combine it with the
programming capability of the Google App Engine and you have yourself a
free number cruncher in the cloud. However, GAE is definitely no match
for your personal computer, so why would you go through all that
trouble? One possible scenario in which this could be useful is for
traders that is often on the road or traders such as myself in which we
have a day job. In that case, you can set you quant analytics on GAE as
a private web application and then you can access it as a web page
anywhere on your mobile phone. One of the obvious limitation with using
GAE is that it has limited features for scientific computing. For
example, it doesn't support Numpy in the Python SDK. As such, I can't
imagine using GAE for anything more than simple technical analysis for
now. I certainly hope that GAE can include more powerful scientific
computing capabilities in the near future. Until then, I really can't
see Google App Engine offering much help aside from performing
algorithmic tasks to help with your trading analysis. Their open issues
log does announce that <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=190">Numpy is being integrated into GAE</a> though. So
that's a great sign for things to come! I am very hopeful of GAE's
potential as a free cloud server to host my quant analytics on. We'll
just have to wait for now.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I spent most of 2008 trading futures and developing automated systems on
Tradestation. The futures trading didn't turn out so well as I lost 40%
of my account and had to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/retirement-from-futures-trading-and-back-to-stocks/">call it quit</a>. My quant development work on
the other hand, was coming along slow but steadily. However, since I
couldn't bear the monstrous maintenance fee anymore at <a href="http://www.tradestation.com/">Tradestation</a>,
I had to abandon that work. Then last year <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-thoughts-and-goals-on-automated-trading-a-year-later/">when I wanted to pick up
where I left off</a> on Matlab, I found that I couldn't just continue my
work. For one, I've lost most of my files. I think I left them in my
other computer in Hong Kong. Which is probably in a landfill by now.
Secondly, I didn't keep a thorough journal <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2008/">back then in 2008</a> like
I'm doing now. Lastly, from the important files that I've kept, I didn't
bother to convert the codes because I might as well write new ones from
scratch than figure out what I did. The reason why I am reminiscing at
the moment is because I am finding myself in the same cycle again. As
regular readers may be aware, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-to-do-when-life-gets-in-your-way-of-trading/">recent events</a> have accelerated my
quant projects schedule. I am experimenting with using Metatrader 4 for
my foreign exchange trading and scripting in MQL4 for automated trading.
Like Tradestation, <a href="http://www.metaquotes.net/en/metatrader4">Metatrader 4</a> is a trading platform with scripting
capabilities. Its programming language, MQL4, is a proprietary language
based on C. I took a few hours this weekend to learn it (as I'm familiar
with C already). So that I can start coding this week. However, after
giving it more thought, I've decided to scale down on my projects with
MQL4. I don't want to rely on a proprietary system for short-term
convenience. As trading programmers know, the language used is merely a
choice. Experience tells me that the bulk of development time is not
spent on the actual programming itself. Rather, much of the time is
spent on formulating, analyzing, and optimizing your algorithm. So I
might as well bite the bullet to build from scratch my automated trading
systems and quant analytics on one platform (i.e. on Python). That has
been my long term plan all along. Everything under one roof. But I
digressed. Then there's the issue of re-useability. Metatrader 4 is
forex-only and only works with brokers that support it. As such, I would
have to use something else for stock trading. Even for a forex-only
system, it would help if I can do intermarket analysis quantitatively.
That's not possible as far as I know with MQL4. Which is another major
downside for me. To summarize other reasons on how I came about this
decision, here are the advantages and disadvantages of using MQL4 versus
using a general programming language, such as Python or C++. The
advantages of using MQL4 are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Saves A LOT of development time as it's already built for trading</li>
<li>Charting, manual and automated trading on one platform</li>
<li>Based on the popular C programming language</li>
<li>Many forex traders use it</li>
<li>Large repertoire of forex-specific programs</li>
</ol>
<p>Disadvantages of using MQL4.</p>
<ol>
<li>Not for real quant analysis or data mining</li>
<li>Limited to MT4-supported brokers</li>
<li>Forex trading only</li>
<li>Proprietary programming language</li>
<li>Must run on Metatrader 4 client terminal</li>
<li>MQL5 coming soon</li>
</ol>
<p>This is certainly a tough choice. Judging by the huge user base, it's
evident that many people are satisfied with MQL4. Yet, as I've discussed
here, there are downsides to using it (besides technical matters). My
current plan remains the same as what I said in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">my last month's trading
review</a>. That is, I will use MQL4 to plug holes in my trading system
for now before migrating to build my own system. In fact, I am already
brewing my first expert advisor starting today. Perhaps I might even
have something to post by the end of this week.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
In my previous post, I discussed about [3 reasons why I don't use
Jensen's alpha or Sharpe ratio for my montly trading performance
measurement][]. In this post, I will talk about what I actually use and
how I came up with it. As I was saying in the previous post, what one
chooses to use as their performance metric depend on 3 factors such as
your style of trading, your agenda, and your interest in this topic. I
will briefly lay out my 3 motives as background information. I use a
swing trading strategy for trading forex. I aim to hold for at least a
few hours to a few days. I am working to hold longer and trade less in
the future, but that's another story. To fit my style of trading, a
performance metric has to be unbiased for long and short trades as well
as taking into account short term conditions in the market. In terms of
agenda, what is the purpose of my performance metric? As a part-time
trader, I answer only to myself. These numbers are used for my
self-improvement and internal month-to-month comparisons only. Lastly,
my interest in this topic of portfolio measurement is limited. I want
something easy to calculate and simple to understand. I have read a few
academic papers on this topic and spent a few hours researching on the
web. That's about it. Now that my motives have been laid out, let's
discuss my process for coming up with my trading performance metric.
Ultimately, my assessment on how well I have done for the month is to
measure my return based on the risk taken. In other words, Performance
Metric = Reward / Risk. My Reward function is simple. I just steal the
idea from Sharpe and use:

> Reward = Net Return - Riskless Return

Shameless. I know. I don't want to muck with the Reward function because
at the end of the day, it is your account balance that matters. The Risk
function takes some more thought. On a trade-by-trade basis, the risk
taken for a particular trade can be thought of as the stop loss. It is a
amount put at risk to be taken by the market. In other words, risk can
be represented by the loss you are willing to take. On a month-to-month
basis, the most important loss value that I pay attention to is my
maximum drawdown. A drawdown imposes a real dent in your account as well
as negatively impact your trading psychology. For these reasons, the
maximum drawdown is a variable in my Risk function.

> Risk = Max. Drawdown ...

However, I am not done yet. While max. drawdown is important, it is an
entirely internal factor. The risk you take is also affected by the
condition of the market. Using the stop loss analogy again, a 50 pips
stop loss can be labelled as both conservative and aggressive risk
exposure depending on the volatility of the market in the timeframe
you're trading. As such, we need to consider volatility in the Risk
function. However, this raises another question, what is volatility.
Long story short, I just snatch the Average True Range (ATR) indicator
that I use on my charts in this formula. However, we can't just stick a
ATR value in because it's an absolute number. We need to use a
percentage ATR (%ATR) to correspond with all the other percentage
numbers in the formula. And since this is for monthly analysis, I grab
the %ATR from a monthly chart. In particular, I use the monthly %ATR on
the U.S. dollar futures chart. Finally, the Risk function is:

> Risk = Maximum Drawdown + %ATR

Thus,

> **Performance Metric = (Net Return - Riskless Return) / (Maximum
> Drawdown + %ATR)**

As an example, here are the values I plug in for each variable to
calculate my performance metric for [November][]. Net Return = 3.15%,
read from November's statement Riskless Return = 0.54% (per annum) / 12
= 0.045%. This is the Canadian 1-year treasury rate in November. Max.
Drawdown = 3.55%, read from November's statement %ATR = monthly ATR(3)
of U.S. dollar futures / monthly close of U.S. dollar futures =
3.1473/74.895. To verify the efficacy of this performance metric. Let's
do a mental check of my criteria as discussed.

1.  Unbiased for long and short trades? Yes, it uses the net return
    regardless of which side you took.
2.  Varies with short term market conditions? Yes, from the %ATR.
3.  Comparable between month to month? Yes, the number is normalized by
    market volatility each month.
4.  Easy to calculate? Yes, it's can be done in my [trade log][]
    spreadsheet with a few formulas.
5.  Easy to understand? Yes, it's an interpretation of reward / risk.

As with any other attempt to summarize trading performance into one
single value, many assumptions have been taken. I cherry picked what I
needed to assemble a formula. Some observant reader will notice that
this formula is similar to the Sterling and Calmar ratios. Indeed, this
is yet another modified form of these ratios. In fact, I will be
referring to this formula as Sterling ratio in my future posts for
simplicity.

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As a part-time trader, measuring my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/monthly-review.html">monthly trading performance</a> can
be as simple or as complex as it can be. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being
just reading the percent return from the account statement and 10 being
running a statistical analysis, my preferred trading performance
measurement method is a simple 3. I am lazy but want a metric that is
useful for monthly self-evaluation. That is why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_alpha">Jensen's alpha</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio">Sharpe ratio</a> have appealed to me. Both of these ratios are can be
easily derived. However, 3 shortcomings of these metrics made me decide
not to use them for my forex trading. First is the fact that they
emphasize <em>excess return</em> with respective of the market. It makes sense
to compare a portfolio with the overall market on a long term basis. But
what if you want to do month-by-month, or even week-by-week analysis?
Short-term market volatility could skew your performance metric up/down
even when you have been performing consistently. Furthermore, what if it
is an out-right bear market? Your short-side strategy would be boosted
by the negative return of the market. For a swing trader such as myself,
a shorter time-frame and long/short unbiased measurements are
non-trivial matters for analysing trading performance. Secondly, neither
metrics factor in volatility of a market. A 5% return in a calm market
is not the same as 5% in a volatile market. If you go out to fish in a
storm, you'd better expect a huge payout to compensate for the extra
risk. Lastly, I don't like their definition of risk. For me, a
short-term performance ratio can sufficiently be characterized as reward
/ risk. Jensen's alpha calculation has no explicit measurement of risk
at all. Whereas Sharpe takes the standard deviation of the portfolio's
return as the risk value. For a monthly analysis, I would have to use a
daily or weekly drawdown to calculate the standard deviation. The
problem with using the daily is that it's too much work for me to do
manually on my spreadsheet. As for the weekly, having just 4 weeks in a
month <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_size">is not a sufficient sampling size</a> to calculate a
representative standard deviation. In summary, here are my 3 reasons for
not using Jensen's alpha and Sharpe ratio.</p>
<ol>
<li>Emphasis on excess return with respect to the market</li>
<li>No consideration for volatility of the market</li>
<li>Not agreeing on their definition of risk</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, there are numerous reasons why these metrics are the
standard portfolio measurments used by many traders. Heck, Jensen's
alpha and Sharpe ratio have been around for 40 years and are still
widely in use today. However, they are just not suitable for me as
discussed. The thing is, there are countless number of new and old
portfolio measurements out there. What one chooses to use depend on
various factors such as your style of trading, your agenda, and your
interest in this topic. In my next post, I will introduce the metric
that I use for my monthly trading performance analysis -- <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/">a modified
Sterling ratio</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>We know that prices can go up or down. We also know that the quality of
these ups and downs can be very smooth or very choppy. As such, it's not
surprising that the trend and volatility of a market form the two
universal characteristics of a price action. No matter which market you
trade, the trend and volatility of the prices will influence your
trading and P&amp;L. That can be both good and bad as volatility is a double
edged sword. A fast paced moving market can rain down gold on you or it
can burn your cash away. Most of the time, it's the latter case.
Consequently, there are many ways traders adapt to changing volatility
in the market. You can tailor your trading strategy, change trading
timeframe, switch market entirely, or manage your risk accordingly, for
examples. In this post, I'd like to give an example for the use of a
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">statistically-derived forex position size table</a> to fit with market
volatility. The problem with market volatility is that it's hard to
notice. As opined by <a href="http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/10/jump-in-stock-market-volatility-and-its.html">Dr. Steenberger</a>, "many traders will adapt to
directional changes quicker than they adapt to shifts in volatility."
The art of identifying market conditions is not discussed in this post.
But obviously, if there is a way to build in an inherent way to manage
your risks based on market volatility, you will have built yourself a
safety net. That is the logic behind my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">statistically-derived forex
position sizer</a>. It's a
data-driven tool to impose an inherent safety net in your trading. What
it does is simple. Here's what it boils down to:</p>
<ol>
<li>It finds the recent 2 sigma value (i.e., a statistical measure of
    volatility, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">see wiki</a>) of each major currency pairs.</li>
<li>It calculates the maximum position size for each pair using the 2
    sigma value.</li>
<li>Then it converts the number to correspond with your account currency
    based on a real-time currency exchange rate for each trading pair.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, a table such as <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">this one I published for
forex</a> can give you a
real-time guideline to the maximum position size you should take given
your risk appetite. One shortcoming with this approach is that while you
may limit your loss during a volatile market, you are also limiting your
potential gain. But this is where the old saying, "let your profit run
and cut your losses short" applies. One solution is to simply add to
your winning trades, according to your trading setups, of course. That
way, when the market moves in your favour or you get confirmation on
your setup, you can increase the position size responsibly without
stretching your principal. By now, it's probably obvious that the use of
such a tool is not, and should not, meant to be a solution to changing
market volatility. It is merely a convenience tool to serve as one of
the many that a trader has at his/her disposal. Nevertheless, I find the
table to be very convenient for me because I don't have to worry about
calculating the position sizes manually on each trade. Trading is tough
enough already, so I like to develop <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/">tools</a> that can make my life
ever so slightly easier.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>In 2008, I spent a few good months <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">developing strategies</a> in
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/easylanguage/">TradeStation</a> full-time for the index futures. Now after a full year
of break in development, I am starting to devote more and more time in
quantitative finance research again. In hindsight, the biggest
shortcoming with my previous strategies is that they are not
discriminating enough. Using an analogy from robotics (my specialty),
some of the most basic robots are great because they can do one task,
and one task only, especially well. Those developers that are too
ambitious in trying to conjure a jack-of-all-trade robot typically fail
miserably. Our current technology simply isn't sufficient for anything
more than a specialized automation. Much is the same in developing
automated trading. With my limited resources and skills, my goal is to
build simple automated systems that can do one job only and do it damn
well. Once that can be achieved, it's only a matter of concatenating all
these individual systems to exploit more and more opportunities.
Therefore, the new plan which I'll follow for development are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify a recurring profitable scenario in the market</li>
<li>Isolate the conditions which would yield a high probability of such
    scenario happening</li>
<li>Program the findings into my platform</li>
<li>Run backtests to calculate the expected profit (probability *
    reward/risk)</li>
<li>Tweak and debug</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, remember this: <em>It's not a matter of the number of trades
you take, it's a matter of being as picky as you can in only playing the
best of the best trades you can find</em>.</p>
