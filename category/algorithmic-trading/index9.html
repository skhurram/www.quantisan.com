                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/productivity-on-the-road/" rel='bookmark'>Productivity on the road</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am waiting for a flight to Geneva. For a guy that works in an
unexciting cubicle, I seem to travel a lot. As Europe is the fourth
continent which I am visiting this year. (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">More about this very exciting
trip</a> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">once I am
back</span>) The thing with travelling is that I will be away from my
development desktop, amongst other things of course. As I work a day job
and can only do my trading analysis and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quant development work</a>
between the hours that I can squeeze in every day, every free minute is
precious. One productivity habit that I adapted from frequent travelling
is that I have a portable <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-is-your-trading-process/">workflow system</a> implemented. For the sake
of completeness by stating the obvious, there are three keys to being
productive while on the road.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exploiting downtime.</li>
<li>Being prepared.</li>
<li>Planning ahead.</li>
</ol>
<p>Being productive doesn't mean that I coup myself up in a hotel room to
work. Enjoying a foreign city and absorbing a different culture help
enhance my personal experience in the long run. Being productive means
exploiting down-times. The times waiting at an airport (like now), stuck
in a plane, the wee hours of the morning when you couldn't sleep because
of jet-lag, etc. Being prepared means have your work ready and
available. There are three free software/services that I can't live
without these days. They are Dropbox, Subversion, and SSH.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dropbox is a web-based file hosting and synchronizing service.
    Basically, after <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTYwMjg4MDY5/">installing the Dropbox software</a>, anything you
    put in your "My Dropbox" directory in your computer will be mirrored
    on their online server. Then you can install the Dropbox software in
    a second computer and choose to link your private dataset with this
    second computer. Thus the "My Dropbox" directory will be
    synchronized in real-time between these two (or more) computers and
    an online version. All your most important files will be up-to-date
    and available to you anywhere. No more need for USB drives.</li>
<li>A software version control system to keep track and backup my source
    code revisions. I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion">Apache Subversion</a> in particular. You can
    use Subversion to archive any file other than source code. For
    example, you can use it to keep track of revisions and branches to
    your presentation slides. [Assembla offers a free 2GB online private
    repository][] so that you can access it from anywhere and save the
    hassle of rolling your own repository server.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">Secure Shell</a> (SSH) is not a service like the other two but a
    network protocol. It is not as easy to setup so I'll leave it to
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+setup+SSH">Google</a>. I use it to securely and remotely access my main
    computer's file system or the desktop when necessary. A simpler
    alternative to SSH is to use <a href="http://www.LogMeIn.com%20">LogMeIn</a>, a remote desktop service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that some of these links are affiliate programs. But I just use
their free services, so I am only recommending you do that too. These
tools not only help me stay productive while away, they also ease the
trouble of using more than one computers between my office, my home
desktop, and my wife's laptop. Together they create a true virtual
development environment. While mobile and cloud computing technologies
are certainly useful, nothing beats old fashioned planning and
organizing. Plan ahead, prepare your work, and have them available with
you wherever you are. A lot can be done with plain pen and paper.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have won first place in the August <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> JForex contest! My
automated strategy returned over 45% in the month of August. With that
honour comes <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/contests/strategy_contest/august-2010/">a \$5,000 grand prize</a> in real greenbacks. The setup
that I used is a minor updated version of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-dual-timeframe-moving-averages-setup/">the one I used last month</a>.
I continue to adapt my system to expect market conditions of the month
ahead. Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong. This contest is turning
out to be more than a nerdy pass time for me as I have finished in the
top 10 three times already since it started in April. However, I must
reiterate the fact that this is not real trading. It's just a paper
trading contest with no real money risked on my part. If I'm really that
good at trading to make 45% of return a month, I wouldn't be writing
this post at lunch in my cubicle at this moment. So yes, back to reality
as I continue my engineering work while improving my own trading and
developing my quantitative trading system in my spare time. As my blog's
tagline reads, this is an engineer's training to trade for a living.</p> </div>

                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/on-technical-analysis-and-fuzzy-logic-for-mechanical-trading/" rel='bookmark'>On technical analysis and fuzzy logic for mechanical trading</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Technical traders realize that technical analysis is more of an art than
science. Until you draw a plethora of lines to fill your chart, which
would render it practically useless, prices rarely "hit the spot" based
on your doodles. This doesn't matter though because trading is not about
charts and guessing numbers. It is about costs and risks (pardon me if
you've heard this a thousand times already). To whom this would matter
though, are the mechanical traders using technical analysis. It may be
<em>obvious</em> to a human to discern price patterns because a trading setup
<em>looks like</em> something you know. However, figuring out "obvious" and
"looks like" is not trivial in a program. Common ways of tackling this
problem is with stochastic algorithms or Bayesian logic. The drawback
with using these methods though, is that they are difficult to conjure
unless you have some vigorous background in math. Hereby I suggest an
alternative--fuzzy logic. In it's simplest implmentation, fuzzy logic
are mere if-then statements. Here's a sample fuzzy logic control system
for regulating temperature with a fan (it is also a trick solution to
the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis">hysteresis problem</a> in control theory...but I
digress),<code>IF temperature IS very cold THEN stop fan IF temperature IS cold THEN turn down fan IF temperature IS normal THEN maintain level IF temperature IS hot THEN speed up fan</code>
As you can see, there can be more than two values for a result. The
classic and ubiquitous TRUE or FALSE boolean is thrown out the window.
Let's dive right into an example of applying fuzzy logic to technical
analysis. Say you are using the RSI as one of your indicators.
Typically, you set a pair of threshold values to determine if the
instrument is overbought or oversold.
<code>String rsiCondition; if (RSI &gt; 70) rsiCondition = "Overbought"; if (RSI &gt;= 30 &amp;&amp; RSI &lt;= 70) rsiCondition = "Neutral"; if (RSI &lt; 30) rsiCondition = "Oversold";</code>
Then here is what a fuzzy logic implementation would look
like.<code>String rsiCondition; if (RSI &gt; 90) rsiCondition = "Very overbought!"; if (RSI &gt; 70) rsiCondition = "Overbought"; if (RSI &gt; 60) rsiCondition = "a little overbought"; if (RSI &gt;= 40 &amp;&amp; RSI &lt;= 60) rsiCondition = "Neutral"; if (RSI &lt; 40) rsiCondition = "a little oversold"; if (RSI &lt; 30) rsiCondition = "Oversold"; if (RSI &lt; 10) rsiCondition = "Very oversold!";</code>
In fact, you may have noticed that the first RSI example is already a
3-valued fuzzy logic. And you're right! Fuzzy logic is that easy. So
what can you do with that second RSI example? Well, perhaps you want to
implement fuzzy logic on a MACD as a second indicator. Then you can
implement a "conviction" algorithm (which isn't possible with TRUE/FALSE
algorithms) by summing the two fuzzy logic (see wiki or google for more
information on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">performing fuzzy logic operations</a>). And then... well.
This is a basic example of exploiting the benefits of fuzzy logic in
automated trading strategies. More advanced use of fuzzy logic is
demonstrated in this seminal work by Lin and Lee, <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=106218&amp;tag=1">Neural-network-based
fuzzy logic control and decision system</a>, 1991. Fuzzy logic + neural
net! Well, as you can see, this is only the tip of the iceberg. P.S. I
have discussed a lot recently about the frontend work that I have been
working on. This post is a break for the reader and a glimpse at what I
am really doing behind the scenes. Let me know in the <a href="#respond">comments below</a>
if this is your cup of tea and I'll write more of this type of posts in
the future.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Proper position sizing is an integral part of risk management. It <em>can</em>
be one of the easiest thing to do too. For example, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/">typically size my
trading position</a> based on the following factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amount of capital willing to put at risk.</li>
<li>Stop price level.</li>
<li>Volatility of the instrument.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following JForex code calculates a lot size based on these three
factors. It is part of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sixth-place-finish-in-the-dukascopy-jforex-july-strategy-contest/">Dukascopy JForex July strategy</a> (complete
source code to the strategy is available via that link). [java
firstline="232"] private double getLot(Instrument instrument) throws
JFException { double riskAmt; double lotSize = 0; riskAmt =
this.acctEquity * (this.riskPct / 100d); // CCYUSD only lotSize =
riskAmt / (this.atr[instrument.ordinal()] * this.atrFactor); lotSize /=
1000000d; // in millions return roundLot(lotSize); } [/java] Referring
to line 237, riskAmt is the amount of capital to put at risk for a trade
(#1). Line 238 calculates lotSize, which is the position size that we
want. The denominator in that division is the distance of the stop in
pips. The strategy uses a multiple of ATR to set the stop loss. Nothing
fancy here. Lines 240--241 are to set the lotSize value according to the
JForex API specification. In which the lot amount is in millions and in
steps of a thousand units, or 0.001 step size. As I've noted in the
code, the caveat to this implementation is that the secondary currency
of the instrument and your account currency needs to be in U.S. dollar.
However, it's just a matter of conversion to extend this method for
other currencies. Update: I expanded on this functionality in the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">JFUtil open source project</a>.</p>
