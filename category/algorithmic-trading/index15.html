            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have worked with <a href="http://www.tradestation.com">TradeStation</a> for a few months earlier this year.
During that time, I worked for a few hours every single day on
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/easylanguage/">developing automated strategies</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/day-trading/">day trading</a> on it. I thought
TS was very good for use as a day trading platform. Particularly now
that I'm using ThinkOrSwim, I feel the TOS system is grossly inadequate
when compared to TS. However, I personally didn't like using TS as an
automated strategy development platform. EasyLanguage (TS's development
language) is definitely easy to learn and use. I would imagine EL would
meet the needs of many people and they'd be satisfied with it. On the
other hand, if you want to develop more complex strategies, the coding
can get complicated to the point of confusing, if it's even possible at
all. Like I never figured out how to build a simple neural net on it.
Besides the language, another limitation of TS is its inadequate API.
For example, and if I remember correctly, I had a hard time in the
programming trying to tie my portfolio value to the strategy. To
accomplish something simple like automatic portfolio balancing. Often
times, I wanted to do something but then found that I needed some
'work-arounds' instead. In essence, EasyLanguage is easy to get started,
but it certainly doesn't provide the depth which I wanted. Granted, it
was a great starting point for me in automated strategies development. I
learned a lot from it. Don't get me wrong though, a good strategy does
not mean a complicated strategy. One could have a profitable strategy
with just a few lines of code (moving averages, anyone?). What I want is
something that can serve as my creative sandbox. I wanted something that
can satisfy my wildest ideas. Actually, I just don't have sufficient
risk capital to let loose a strategy, so I have the luxury of not tasked
to yield results and is free to play with what I want. Including my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/stanford-machine-learning-lectures-pomdp/">POMDP discussion in my previous post</a>, and my other idea of using
modern control theory (my study focus back in the days) to identify
market inefficiencies. I couldn't have done those with EL without
over-complicating matters (DLL's, add-ons, etc.). The biggest factor
though, was the monthly subscription cost. I stopped my TS subscription
eventually because I just can't afford it. So what next? After some
digging, I came across <a href="http://www.ninjatrader.com">Ninja Trader</a>. They support C# programming in
their strategies. What's more, <strong>it's free</strong> for development use! I will
be using it with opentick for a free datafeed. Free platform, free data!
What more could I ask for? <strong>Update:</strong> It seems that opentick is
overloaded and haven't been taking on new users for a few months now.
I'll just use the simulated data within NT for now. <strong>Update 2009:</strong>
Opentick is now closed until further notice according to them. I have
began going through the NT tutorials and trying to refresh my distant
memories on some technical topics. After a few months of vacation, I am
back to the drawing board again. We'll see how it goes. I will document
my progress here under the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading category</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Came across this gem accidentally today. Here are the [complete 20
lectures for CS 229 Machine Learning from Stanford University][] for my
own record. I have learned most of the material before, but have
forgotten most of it already. In particular, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCqPMD6coO8">last lecture</a> talks
about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POMDP">POMDP</a>. I have always thought it would be a great tool to be
applied on a financial trading system. Long story short, POMDP is a
distinctive machine learning algorithm because it inherently assumes the
'world' is partially-observable (MDP on its own takes care of the
uncertainty part). A drawback with using artificial intelligence in
trading is that A.I. are good for closed ended system but bad for open
ended ones (i.e. trading). I believe POMDP can be worked on to become a
valuable trading system. I haven't tried implementing it myself yet
because of lack of a good platform and data. But since POMDP has been
around for years now, I would assume somebody somewhere has tried this
already. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any information on
this problem. In any case, this post is merely a reminder for myself.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Another day, another strategy. For the past couple of days, I've been
working on the 2MA cross with ADX confirmation strategy for ER2H08 1200
sh/bar. Basically, an HMA(Low, 8) crossing over EMA(Low, 24) as the
trigger. Condition2 is that the current high is highest of past 3 bars.
Condition3 is current ADX is also highest of the past 3 bars. Condition4
is that it is during day time so fewer slippage.</p>
<p>Exit is simply HMA(Low, 23) crossing under EMA(Low, 33) or it is nearing
the close of the day session. Stop is \$350; Floor is \$500 and 63%
retracement.</p>
<p>Upon loose optimization on Oct 1, 2007 to Nov 30, 2007 data, the Long
strategy achieved 3.37 profit factor, 57% profitable, and a steadily
rising performance graph. Very good indeed. I was estatic yesterday.</p>
<p>I continued to work on the strategy for the whole day today and
developed a Short version using the same concept. The result were very
good too (PF > 3, etc).</p>
<p>From the back-testing data, the Long and Short together has PF over 2
and steady rising performance too. From the calculation, I would make
over \$7000 for the 2 months on 1 contract alone.</p>
<p>Feeling pretty confident, I felt the system was somewhat complete, so I
tested it using the lastest 30 days of data. Unfortunately, it failed
miserably. PF was way under 1.0 and the gross profit were a mere couple
of thousand dollars. The net profit were estimated to be just a few
hundred dollars.</p>
<p>So I tested the system on another set of data. August 2007. The result
was even worse!</p>
<p>Long story short, I found out that ADX isn't that reliable to confirm
with major swings.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Seeing that many indicators use a MA for calculation. It may be possible
to use new MA algorithm to improve on their calculation.</p>
<p>For example, the RS in RSI is something like RS = EMA(up days) /
EMA(down days). We could change it to RS = HMA(up days) / HMA(down
days). Since HMA is much faster, the resulting H-RSI may be faster too.
This can be useful in day trading strategies.</p>
<p>More work needs to be done to test this idea.</p> </div>
