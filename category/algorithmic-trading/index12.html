                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/" rel='bookmark'>An explanation of my Keltner Channel and Candlestick hybrid setup</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is an explanation of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading</a> strategy for the
Dukascopy JForex Strategy Contest in April. This strategy just made its
first trade today after running for about 72 hours. My contest demo
account closed with a gain of 7% on this first trade. Note that this
strategy is built for competing in a contest and not for real trading
(i.e., it's purely a no cost gamble). Here is the concept for this high
probability trading setup. Referring to Figure 1 below, the red arrow
marks my short entry on EURGBP today. These are the technical analysis
indicators the strategy uses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend: Signaled by 50 bar moving average above (bullish) or below
    (bearish) the 200 bar moving average.</li>
<li>Momentum: Oversold or overbought RSI conditions, but not used in a
    traditional manner...</li>
<li>Volatility: I use the Keltner channel to measure volatility.</li>
<li>Price action: Observe candlestick behaviour to identify trend
    continuation. This is where the secret to this strategy happens. I
    will explain this below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that I used a Bollinger Bands in the chart of Figure 1 because I
couldn't find the Keltner Channel indicator in Metatrader (my charting
software). It doesn't affect my conceptual illustration anyhow. The
setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify overarching trend via 50/200 moving averages as explained
    above.</li>
<li>Confirm price is still playing to the trend by checking if current
    market price is on the right side of the 200 bars moving average.
    Price above for bullish and below for bearish.</li>
<li>Once steps 1-2 are in place, it's assumed that the trend is strong.
    We look for a setup in the trend's direction. In particular, we look
    for a <em>failed counter-trend retracement</em> setup using candlestick in
    combination with the Keltner channel.</li>
<li>Sounds fancy but it's simple. Using a short-side example, the bar's
    high has to penetrate above the Keltner channel yet it closes within
    it. Then the short entry is signaled. The opposite for a long-side
    entry.</li>
<li>RSI overbought and oversold conditions are used to filter out slow
    and steady counter-trend moves (those are evil).</li>
</ol>
<p>Another benefit of using a price channel is that I also use it to peg my
take profit target and stop loss. As I said in my previous post, because
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> expects winning contestants to submit their source codes,
I am not using anything proprietary or extraordinary here. As such, this
is totally different than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">what I use to trade on my own</a>. Namely more
reliance on indicators and less on price action and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p><strong>Update</strong>: I have since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">won the JForex strategy contest a few
times</a>. If you are looking to learn JForex programming, you can start
with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-multiple-time-frame-strategy/">an explanation of my winning strategy</a> and my long <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/jforex/">list of
JForex posts</a>. The Dukascopy JForex Strategy Contest began last week.
Starting this month, <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> offers \$15,000 total of cash prizes
to the top 10 automated trading systems every month. However, before
entering, there are a couple of clauses in their contest rules that
caught my attention.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cash prizes are deposited into contestant's Dukascopy account
    (Ranking and Awarding Rules #5).</li>
<li>All source code needs to be submitted and agrees to be published
    (Ranking and Awarding Rules #2 and #6).</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 is troublesome because it means winners have to <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">open an account
with Dukascopy</a> if they don't already have an account with
them. But that isn't a big deal since they are actually one of the best
forex brokers. I planned to open an account with them anyway. However,
#2 will certainly turn many people away. The requirement to disclose
source code in an automated trading contest is almost unheard of as far
as I know. Are you willing to disclose your winning system just for that
few hundred, or a even few thousand, dollars of prize money? In any
case, I decided to enter this contest anyway just for fun. Yet, you can
be sure that I won't be using any proprietary logic in my system. In
fact, I just finished my automated trading strategy today and it is now
running. I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/">discuss about my strategy</a> after it completes its
first trade. That might take a while as my system is expected to make
fewer than 5 trades in a month.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The good news is that I have finished my data scraping module for
extracting all the company data listed on the two Toronto Stock
Exchanges (TSX and TSV). I presented an <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/data-scraping-the-toronto-stock-exchange-extracting-3660-companies-data/">alpha version of this data
scraping module</a> last week. I added the functionality to download all
the historical quotes from Yahoo for all the companies. These data are
stored locally in a cool HDF5 format with PyTables. I am very happy
about that part. The bad news is that my module looks more like a hacked
job than a piece of software. There is no defined structure for my
underlying codes. It is obvious to me that this module would be
difficult to extend, which is the whole point of my project. In
programming jargon, my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code smells</a> (Wikipedia). Then it finally
dawned on me. I am <em>way</em> behind in my programming skills. For the past
few years, my quant work has been confined to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/starting-to-use-matlab-for-quantitative-finance/">MatLab</a> or some
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-automated-trading-development-platforms-for-beginner-to-advanced-traders/">proprietary trading platforms</a>. I wrote scripts. Not programs. My
problem with programming is that I am still stuck in a procedural
programming mentality because that is what I've always used. Even though
I updated my knowledge recently by learning Python, learning to program
with an object oriented programming language is only the first step. (I
am also familiar with C++ and Java from way back) To use an analogy,
programming a software is like constructing a building. The actual
coding itself is akin to the construction work. I got that part. But
coding without a well designed plan can only go so far. It is now clear
to me that if I am to build the trading software to complement my
trading as I have envisioned it, I need to step it up with my <em>software
design</em> ability. Consequently, I am now catching up on object oriented
design and analysis, as well as software design patterns with a couple
of books. I will try not to get too carried away with these though. My
main focus is trading. But this will be very beneficial for my trading
in the long run if I can build a more robust trading software that can
easily grow with my future needs. I have many big plans for this side
project of mine. I posted a UML diagram showing an <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-is-your-trading-process/">architectural
overview of my project</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>One of the tasks that I've always wanted to make more efficient in my
stock trading is the work of scanning for stocks to trade. One look at
my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy posts</a> and you'll see that I have devised many
stock scanning systems in the past few years. The most recent system
that I've used is one that uses <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/week-of-sept-13-2009-in-play-stocks-breakout-results/">options data to filter stocks</a>.
However, it is not automated. So it takes a lot of time to gather and
analyze the data. Furthermore, the set of tools that I use is limited to
U.S. stocks. Now that I have taken an interest in the Canadian stock
market, I can't seem to find any public tool that I like. Thus, I am
biting the bullet now and taking my time to develop a custom system once
and for all. Before we can analyze stock data, we need to extract them
first. Where better else for that than go straight to the source at
TMX.com, the parent company of Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and TSX
Venture Exchange (TSXV). TMX.com provide a list of publicly traded
companies in ten Excel files. The files are divided by sectors. Each
contain a number of fundamental company data, such as market
capitalization and outstanding shares. So step 1 is to extract those
data. This is where I am at now. I attached the source code for an
alpha/developmental release below for anyone interested. It is a working
program to scrape the data from TMX.com's files. But it's still a
work-in-progress. That's why I am calling it a version 0.1. The next
milestone is to program a Stocks class to hold, organize, and manage all
three thousand, six hundred, and sixty companies' data. This is an easy
task to do by extending the built-in dictionary class in Python.
However, I haven't gotten to that chapter yet in my scientific
programming with Python learning book. I stopped at chapter 8 to work on
this project. Chapter 9 is the inheritence and hierarchical material.
The goal of this project is to build an automated data scraping program
for TSX and TSXV data from various sources into my computer. Once I have
my data, that's when the real fun starts. Regarding the code below, I
know that source code is useless for most people. Once the project is
complete, I will compile the code into a standalone application and post
it on this site. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/feed/">Subscribe to my RSS feed</a> so that you can keep
