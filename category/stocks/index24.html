            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Yesterday was definitely a trend down day. The Monday market gapped down
huge and continued its slide. It's the only big down day we've had since
March 20.</p>
<p>Incredibly, we've managed to close below the 835 support which I've
noted <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-18-2009/">week</a> after <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-14-2009/">week</a> in the recent rally. This is definitely a
strong indication of the end of this 6-week long rally (conveniently
reminded all too often to us by the media).</p>
<p>Around 10:00 am yesterday, notice that the TICK on Figure 2 has been
trending down and then made a pop up. Yet, the price failed to budge.
The Advance-Decline line always kept sliding in the early morning. These
are early indications of the things to come yesterday. Further upside
pop on the TICK (above 500) throughout the day were basically ignored on
the price. That added to my resolve and my stop for SRS just below
yesterday's close was very safe.</p>
<p>From Figure 3, we see the VIX has bounced on a support and tested 40
yesterday. The VIX has been on a decline steadily and the rally was
unchallenged. Yesterday's move has certainly pounded in some uncertainty
at the very least on this rally.</p>
<p>Well, as discussed above, it's clear to everyone that the market will
tank today. From Figure 1, I expect 845 (recent resistances) to be the
resistance and 825 (top of downtrend, not shown here, refer to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-18-2009/">weekly
review</a>) to be the support. The line in the sand is at 835, the
long term pivot price level. Who knows, maybe the market will surprise
us again.</p>
<p>As of this moment, the ES futures is down 7.25 points. If this is to be
a strong down move, then 835 should not hold today for the sake of
momentum.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://zerohedge.blogspot.com/2009/04/vornado-to-issue-125-million-shares.html">Zero Hedge has an interesting post on VNO</a> (a component of
SRS) which might explain why SRS tanked 2 points in the last few minutes
on Tuesday. Essentially, just before the close, there were two massive
transactions with a premium above the market price, i.e. two huge trades
at \$2 above market price. A sold to B above market. Then B sold back to
A at same price. Nothing has really been traded, but VNO gets to print a
\$2 higher price for the close.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market has continued to chug along upward this week. In last week's
review, I said the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-14-2009/">market was obviously in a short term rally run</a>.
And just like last week, this up run is looking weak from the indicators
(Figure 1). Yet, as weak as it might seem, the fact is that the market
is breaking resistances one after another. We ended the week on another
significant resistance at 875 on the S&amp;P 500. This is definitely a level
to watch next week. However, do note that we have tested this level on a
lower volume on Friday. So it's likely that we'll fail to break this
resistance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, from Figure 2, you can clearly see that we've been
adhering to a tight uptrend channel formed from the beginning of March.
From that chart, we can glean that our support is about 860. Thus, our
narrow trading range is 860 - 875 in the short term for next week. And
the major levels would be 830 and 900, from long term lines shown in
Figure 2.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that we'll be seeing 830 before 900 from the weakening
rally. However, I've been proven wrong many times before. In any case,
just watch the levels I noted and let the market tell you where it is
heading.</p>

<p><strong>GICS Sectors Review</strong></p>
<p>On the 6-month and 3-month charts, it's easy to see that although the
Financials have been playing catch-up lately, they still have a lot of
grounds to make up for. The Telecoms still remain the top performer with
the Techs in the second spot.</p>
<p>Notice that on the 5-day chart, we can see the top performers
(Financials and Industrials) have retraced in the last hour for most of
the week. This is a bearish sign.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm back from my long weekend. S&amp;P 500 has broken above 850 and tested
860 on Monday while I was away.</p>
<p>On Monday, we made a failed attempt to rush through 860. A similar
scenario happened at 830 and 840 in the past 2 weeks. Each time, the
market dipped slightly but managed to climb even further up (Figure 1).
Would history repeat itself the third time?</p>
<p>The 10 day MA for S&amp;P500 (SPY) has stayed above the 40 day MA since
March 26 now. That's more than 2 weeks of run. This hasn't happened
since Sept 2008, and even then it wasn't that long. This is definitely
the longest up run we've had since 2006!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the indicators are looking as toppy as ever (Figure
1). In addition, the down trend as shown in Figure 2 is still intact,
and this decreasing volume rally can only confirm it.</p>
<p>In the intermediate term, I'm still bearish. Yet, I must admit that this
run has been pumping up and up for a lot longer than I expected. As a
trader, the most easiest way to make money is to go with the flow. As of
now, the flow of the market is up, unless proven otherwise. So my
strategy now is to wait and observe the retracement before rebalancing
my positions, if needed. I'm net short since last week.</p>
<p>Some key intermediate term levels for the S&amp;P 500 are: 38% Fibonacci at
790, 40 day MA at 780, 200 day MA still high above at 970 or so.</p>

<p><strong>GICS Sector Review</strong></p>
<p>From the 6 months chart, we can see that the Financials (XLF) is fast
approaching the support from December of 2008. The V-shaped bounce has
been fierce particularly for XLF.</p>
<p>This XLF bounce is even more evident in the 1 month and 5 days charts.
It's common knowledge that this type of climb up is hardly sustainable.
Thus, everyone is watching the Financials as usual for any signs of
weakness. And if that happens, the market can quickly turn ugly.
However, the inevitable retracement doesn't have to be deep. It could
very well dip, consolidate, and rocket up again.</p>
<p>Given the longer term perspective of the market as described in the
first section, I doubt that though. In any case, just watch the
Financials as an indicator.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I placed a stop buy this morning for FAZ just above its intraday
resistance along with a stop just below its intraday low. The entry
triggered before lunch (11:44) but then I got stopped out at 12:43pm.
This is a short term play as FAZ was hit hard today with WFC's
"unexpected" profit. But I noticed WFC was unable to sustain its opening
high and continued to drift lower all morning while S&amp;P 500 is hanging
below 850. I interpreted that as a divergence and entered FAZ.</p>
<p>However, FAZ has tanked further and its trading at 12.82 as I write
this. Good that I tacked on a hard stop with my order.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I ditched my GE calls at the open today when the S&amp;P 500 made a gap up
and GE gapped open at \$11.10. These options were purchased at 0.49. So
that's a loss of \$56.35 + \$15 for commission. However, I'm definitely
out too early as GE is hanging around \$11.50 as I'm writing this.</p>
<p>The reason for this quick exit is because the long weekend starts
tomorrow so the options premium is sure to drop. Since I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-5-ge-100-apr-09-11-put-79/">cleared my
puts for GE on Tuesday</a> already, I'm out of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">my GE strangle</a>
entirely now.</p>
<p>In addition to a bad entry on my part, the time decay really ate up my
premiums. I should review the details of this trade another time. I am
off to a long weekend soon.</p>
