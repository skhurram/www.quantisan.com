            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Just shorted crude oil via the Horizons BetaPro Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO).
Purchase price is \$11.11 bought minutes after the<a href="http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_sum_sndw_dcus_nus_w.htm">weekly crude oil
inventories release today</a>. Crude (DBO) made a small run to test
resistance at \$27.80 on the release. Figure 1 showing DBO's 27.80 and
25.15 resistance levels. \$25.15 on DBO is my stop loss level.</p>

However, I'll start to worry if price breaks below \$10.80. Figure 2 is
an intraday chart of HOD.TO. Risk is (\$11.11 - \$10.50) * 250 shares =
\$152.5 or 1.7% of account. I shorted crude instead of natural gas as I
previous did because HND.TO is cracking its 200 day moving average
around \$6.70. Whereas HOD.TO is looking strong.</p>

about half an hour before the close. \$72.50 is the 50% retracement

\$72.50 is the bottom of a congestion zone in middle of May.</p>

<p>The trading volumes in CM.TO and the TSX index are weak. So I am betting

\$8.60 last week while I was away. So I am not taking any chance for
this position to go negative. The net gain in this is \$25 after \$10

it seems that natural gas is in consolidation mode. I will be watching
the channel as drawn on Figure 2 for another chance to short it via
HND.TO later. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am shorting Natural Gas via the Horizons 2x leveraged bearish ETF
(HND.TO). The U.S. Energy Information Association (EIA) released their
<a href="http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html">weekly natural gas storage report</a> yesterday. The underground storage
amount is only 4.9% above last year's level. However, as <a href="http://shockedinvestor.blogspot.com/2010/05/why-natural-gas-should-be-shorted-or.html">Shocked
Investor points out</a>, last year's amount was a record high. So 4.9%
above last year's is even higher. Figure 1 shows the two year graph of
natural gas storage and the 5-year avearge channel. [caption id=""

futures was testing \$4.50 resistance yesterday (Figure 2) within a
prolonged downtrend. As such, both fundamental and technical shows
bearishness. So I shorted natural gas with HND.TO today on retracement
to \$7.25 support (Figure 3). This retracement is due to HND meeting
resistance at \$7.50 (50% Fibonacci level on the \$8 to \$7 drop this
week).</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been watching CIBC (CM.TO) for a few months now. CM finally
presented a shorting opportunity that I took today. Figure 1 speaks for
itself. Furthermore, the lackluster rally in EUR/USD after the ECB's
vouch for confidence is encouraging for the bears.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="CIBC

<p>\$74.00 - \$74.50 is a strong resistance for CM. There are three
scenarios in which this trade can play out. CM can go up, go down, or
move sideway. If CM move upward, I will watch the push above \$74.50. My
current exit stop is at \$75.00 (about \$1 on the premium). However, as
this is an options position. There is a time decay factor working
against me. As such, I will decrease my exit stop by \$1.00 on the share
price every month to compensate. For example, by mid-June, my exit stop
is \$74.00 on the underlying share price of CM. If CM move downward, I
will move my stop to breakeven if it breaks below \$72. If CM move
sideway, I will give it a month's time. If CM just consolidates around
\$74, I will exit by late June for a loss of \$1 (\$300 total) on the
premium. My targets are \$70, \$68, and \$65 as shown on Figure 1. I
will tighten my stop passing each support level. My ideal loss is \$300
at most. That represents 3.4% of my total account on this trade.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update May 10: Looks like I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-illustration-of-what-it-means-by-missing-the-boat-in-trading/">missed the boat</a>. TCK.B gapped up almost
7% at the Monday open to \$38.88. I won't be chasing the market at this
point as the reward/risk ratio isn't appealing anymore. Update: I got
stopped out at breakeven (after commission) before I can post this piece
at the end of the day. I'm back to all cash going into the weekend. I am
taking a dip in Teck Resources (TCK/B.TO) with 110 shares bought at
\$36.03. This is a trade to "buy when everyone else is in fear".
Following my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-hell-and-back-a-review-of-tsx-after-a-v-day/">assessment of the market yesterday</a>, I don't think
things are that bad, yet. So I am establishing a small position in a
strong company today. TCK is trading on its 200 day moving average at
\$35 this week (Figure 1). Yesterday's epic dive and recovery didn't
break this \$35 support. So that's a very good sign for TCK.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Tech Resources
(TCK-B.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO.png" />][][/caption] Furthermore, \$35 is an obvious
psychological round number support. It is also above the recent low of
\$32.50 printed in February of this year as shown in Figure 1. The
oscillator value (top of Figure 1) is making a positive divergence as
TCK is testing this support level). I entered today based on the 5-day
intraday chart. This morning's opening hour test of \$35 support has
lower volume than earlier this week (Figure 2). As such, I think \$35
can hold. So I entered when the price shot above minor resistance at
\$36.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TCK-B.TO
intraday snapshot at time of entry"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO-intraday.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO-intraday.png">1</a>[/caption] The price
drifted back under \$35.50 after I entered but then reversed and tested
\$37. I moved my stop loss to breakeven as it touched an equidistance
price opposite of my stop. Just so I don't see profits turn into losses.
If I get stopped out today, I will not re-enter until after the weekend.
My target is \$40 and original stop was \$35 for about a 4 to 1 reward
to risk ratio. I am risking 1.25% in this trade with a position size of
110 shares.</p>
