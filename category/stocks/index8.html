            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update at Noon: Looks like I am wrong. LLL.TO is testing its recent high
at \$40.50. However, volume is rather low up to now. I'm out my
Lululemon (LLL.TO) position because of market softness. Bonds (TLT) are
holding a support level. EUR/USD is struggling to hold above 1.27. And
the oversea markets (Asia and Europe) are weak overnight. Perhaps the
market is getting ready to catapult up. Perhaps it is not. But I'm not
going to place my bet on anything as I don't have a clue where it's
about to go at the moment. So I am stopping out of this position at
breakeven. Preserving capital. Moreover, recent price move in Lululemon
(LULU on Nasdaq) is disappointing. Despite the market marking new
consecutive highs for the past few days, LLL is stuck in a rut as shown
in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Purchase price of these shares were <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-140-lll-to-39-86/">\$39.86 from a week ago</a>.</p>
<p>Exact return is (\$40 - \$39.86) * 140 = \$19.60 - \$9.90 commission =
\$9.70. In any case, I'm all cash in my account now. At least I've free
myself from the market for the next two weeks during my trip to Hong
Kong. Here's an updated view of the daily chart of LLL.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market may be initiating a bear rally again according to the breath
indicator of Figure 1. We are seeing a positive divergence from the
upticking companies above 50-dma/200-dma ratio (solid line in main
graph) and the lower low on the TSX. Furthermore, TSX index price has
been holding a longer term support at 11000 despite a new recent low on
the number of companies above their respective 200 day moving average
(top indicator) . The CDNV to TSX ratio is also showing a similar
positive divergence.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Toronto
Composite (\$TSX)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-TSX.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Thus, I am taking a bullish step with a cautious long position in
Lululemon (LLL.TO). There's a strong uptrend in this one as shown in
Figure 2. \$37.50 looks like a long term support. However, my stop is
\$38-\$39 zone to be in sync with the market move. Also, the gap to
\$37.50 support has been closed previously already in May, so a second
re-test wouldn't bold well for LLL.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Lululemon
Athletica (LLL.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO.png">1</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>In addition to the chart, LLL currently has an enormous 22.79% short
floats according to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/finviz/">Finviz</a>. It is 70.51% owned by the big money with
a 3.72% increase in holding in the last quarter. Short squeeze, anyone?</p>
<p>I took timed my entry based on intraday chart Figure 3. The top gap
today held for the first hour at least and then there were some
increased volume at the intraday support. I entered then.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="LLL.TO intraday
chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO-intra.gif" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO-intra.gif">2</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>However, LLL touched \$40 and is now retraced below \$39.50.</p>
<p>My mental stop is \$39.00 and my hard stop is \$38.50.</p>
<p>That is a risk of (\$38.50 - \$39.86) * 140 = \$190.40 + \$9.90
commission = \$200.30 = 2.13%.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>What I thought would be an intermediate term hold turns out to have
lasted mere minutes. I bought Teck Cominco (TCK.B.TO) after a small
bounce at \$34 support during lunch today. Figure 1 shows the clear
support level. Also note the fact that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-43-mark-16-27-loss-0-5/">my recent shorts haven't been
working</a>, so I thought I would go with the flow and go long. [caption

immediately after my long entry (something I haven't done in a while).
TCK cracked the \$34 support swiftly to \$33.80, my mental support. My
alert was sounded and I kept an eye on it afterward. But then not long
after \$33.80, my hard stop at \$33.70 was filled and TCK traded down to
\$33.66 or so. It has now stabilized around \$33.80 as of 2pm. Figure 2
shows the intraday chart of TCK.B.TO. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

for this trade is (\$33.68 - \$34.10) * 250 = -\$105 - \$4.95 * 2
commission = -\$114.90 = -1.2% of account. My account is now
experiencing a 3.4% drawdown since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">the high on June 8th</a>. I can't
help but feel that this was a stop hunt. TCK is creeping higher at the
moment. However, as my initial position was stopped out, I am not going
to re-enter this trade just yet. Let's see what it does near the close
today. I am labelling this particular trade as a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">bad trade</a> because
my stop was clearly too tight based on the time frame that I am
observing. I should have reduced my position size and widened my stop to
account for the recent volatility. Update: TCK gapped down 7% the day
after. At least my exit was timely.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Not much is happening in the market as it is trading in a tight range.
This is not good for my options as the time delta will slowly eating
away my premium. So I've decided to unload this position at a small loss
just now as the market is testing support across the board. The U.S.
dollar index is testing \$86 resistance. Oil is testing \$78 support.
S&amp;P500 is testing the 1070 support zone. Purchase price for these puts
were <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-48-mark-16-38/">\$1.48 per contract last Wednesday</a>. When Manulife Financial
(MFC.TO) was trading at 16.38. Loss is (\$1.48 - \$1.43) * 100 * 4 =
\$20 - \$13.95 * 2 commission = \$47.90 = 0.5% of account. As you can
see, the commission is horrible on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">RRSP trading account at
Questrade</a>. I will wind down trading options from now on and move back
to trading forex in the summer. My live account at <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> is
ready... Update: The market finally broke support the day after this
exit. This was not a good exit as I lost patience. MFC is testing \$16
support on June 29th opening hour and I don't expect it to hold. This
could turn out to be a winner if I had held.</p>
