further pushed along and closed at \$24.14.</p>
<p>I should have noticed from the 200 week MA that SCSC has been pretty
strong lately. I should have only entered when the long term trend is in
sync with my position.</p>
<p>Anyway, after running through a few more charts, it seems that my stock
filter is giving a contrarian indication. There's still a lot of work to
do to develop this new system.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>In my <a href="/about/">About page</a>, I summarized my trading history. You'll no doubt
see that between now and then, I admitted that I plundered my trading
account twice. Needless to say, that was a memorable period in my life.
The easy money from my lucky early years bit back hard and were taken
away within months. I'm surprised at myself why I'm even back at this
game now. There's a reason why I'm bringing this up. No, I am not broke
again. I only commit what I can lose in trading now. Still, I am aware
that I need to do a lot better in terms of risk management and
discipline before I can become a decent trader. But I digressed. You
see, like a dead pirate clinging on to his treasure, I've never let go
of those shares from that trade that broke me. As of this writing, I
still have a sizable shares of EMFP that I purchased from 2006 for
average of $1.23. For the record, here are my 3 entries:</p>
<ol>
<li>November 9, 2006 for 3500 shares at $0.77</li>
<li>November 30, 2006 for 9512 shares at $0.56</li>
<li>December 31, 2006 for 34695 shares at $1.46</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, comparing the dates and entry prices with the chart of Figure
1, it seems that my record is wrong because the trading prices on those
dates are way off. I will need to dig up some paper and check my record.
Anyway, my average price is correct at $1.23. For the first few months
of the share price dive, I was so naive that I thought the stock was
<em>cheap</em>. Then once reality sets in, I was just in shock that I didn't do
anything about it. By then, it was too late to savage anything
worthwhile.</p>
<p>As you can see from Figure 1, the move from $2.00 to $0.20
took 1 year. Since then, I just wrote this position off in my mind and
left the shares to collect dust. As you can see, EMFP even dipped to
$0.01 last year. My intention is to unload it in a later year when I
need a tax break. However, this week, EMFP moved from $0.07 to $0.35
and closed at $0.20.</p>
<p>You see, EMFP, or Emergency Filtration Products
Inc., markets a product called NanoMask that has been independently
tested to be effective against influenza and other viruses as a face
mask. With the recent talk of a global pandemic because of the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-04-28-swine-flu_N.htm">swine flu scare</a>, it's clear to see why there's renewed interest in EMFP.</p>
<p>In fact, the volume has spiked to about 2 million yesterday and almost 1
million shares today. There were days and weeks with no share traded at
all for EMFP in the past year. I am not so naive anymore to think EMFP
may climb back to its former glory. However, I hope EMFP can stir up
some more interest and trading volume, just so I can finish the fight
once and for all and close this embarassing trade in my log book. So,
I'd like to start this trade log and put EMFP back on my radar. I should
have unloaded a chunk of my holding yesterday when EMFP stayed around
$0.25. </p>
<p>However, I thought that I've waited this long, I might as well
let this flu panic play out and give EMFP more time to do something.
This is the first of my mistake, greed. This could very well cost me my
last chance to ditch this. My reason for holding is that we've hit the
200 day MA at $0.35 yesterday (Figure 2), so a bounce back was
expected.</p>
<p>Then today, EMFP held above the $0.13 support (low was
$0.14) on the retracement. With the still relatively low volume, this
stock is swinging like a wild bull. So large trading ranges is a given.
There are definitely a lot of resistance at $0.30. Yet, we have
established an up trend since the bounce from $0.01. This recent gap up
at huge volume would look good if EMFP can break above this up trend
with this momentum. Otherwise, breaking below $0.13 support would lead
this back to the coffin. Anyway, it's too early to tell. I usually say
watch the price levels at this point, however, in this case, I say that
it's more important to watch the volume. A sustained level of volume in
EMFP means there's finally some interest. And since we're pretty much at
rock bottom for the price, volume would lead to higher prices.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>As title says, ScanSource (SCSC) had a huge 20% swing at the open today.
SCSC released an earnings report yesterday at the close. I don't really
care what they said, but we actually broke above my stop at \$22.70
briefly at the open. Although my stop order didn't get filled. Then SCSC
just drifted ever so slightly downward thoughout the day. Remember, the
market climbed back to 870 today, so this is suppose to be a bullish
day. This is definitely a weakness on SCSC. The waiting game continues.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This week's market action is practically a carbon copy of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-18-2009/">the week
before</a>. We started on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/end-of-the-6-week-rally-and-back-with-the-year-long-beartoday/">Monday with a huge gap down</a>, regained some
footing on Tuesday and Wednesday, dipped lower on Thursday, then climbed
back to the level of the Friday before. Obviously, we're in a trading
range these past two weeks around 830 - 870 on the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>From Figure 1, we're still in the over bought level, with signs of
divergence, etc. etc. You've heard this tune before, so I won't repeat
myself. The only thing for certain in this volatile market is that ...
it's volatile. So no matter which side of the trade you're on, I'd be
more picky in this market.</p>
<p>Obviously, the support is at 830 and resistance is at 870 as I've said.
Also, notice from Figure 1 that volume has been relatively low in this
range so far. If there is any breakout either way, volume and momentum
would be the things to watch.</p>
<p>As of right now, my portfolio consists of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/review-of-positions-srs-and-uso/">SRS, USO</a>, and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/eslr/">ESLR</a>
(<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-eslr-599848/">from way back</a>). Needless to say, my SRS is at the bottom of the sea
with a 50% loss for the trade. This is just unacceptable. I have since
written <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules/">my trading rules in stone</a> and vowed to never break a stop.</p>
<p>On the plus side, this has certainly woken me up again as I've been
getting complacent lately in my trading regimen. Thus I'm relieving
myself to just light trading and heading back to trading development and
would spend most of my time improving my systems and skills.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am experimenting with a new trading strategy. This is a log for a
<strong>paper trade</strong> I'm taking using this strategy for the first time.</p>
<p>The new stock filter as part of this new strategy generated a list of
stocks yesterday based on options volatility. Then I hand picked
ScanSource (SCSC) in particular to watch today as it looked to be
forming a basic setup where I can recognize.</p>
<p>To be clear, the signal is for short. So this is a setup for a short
entry. Following my newly etched 3 rules, I'm not jumping in with a
market order. Instead, I'll be setting up a short entry stop and
attaching it with an exit stop on the order.</p>
<p>Following <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/end-of-the-6-week-rally-and-back-with-the-year-long-beartoday/">Monday's epic dive</a> and Tuesday's rebound, the market has
closed below 845 on Wednesday. In particular, the late day dive is
looking good for the bear. Let's see if we can break below 835 tomorrow.
In any case, I don't want to digress into a market analysis here. Just
note that for the short and intermediate terms, the market seem to be
going down. Thus, I'm looking for shorting opportunities.</p>
<p>Back to SCSC. Notice the negative divergence on the daily and weekly
indicators. Also notice that \$22.70 is a long term resistance from last
October. Thus, I'm setting a stop at \$22.70 for this trade.</p>
<p>Secondly, when should I enter? I have given the entry more leeway since
we're in a choppy market. Also, I would like to enter at an obvious
point when the stock is starting to tank. So there's a higher
probability of success. I chose the entry stop at \$21.40. It is the top
for a previous run-up on April 3. See figure 2.</p>
<p>My target is marked on Figure 2 at \$18.50. It was a major support for
January and February before the run down into the abyss for SCSC. Also,
I took into account the Stochastic information. SCSC has been in an
overbought level on the daily for almost a month now (along with the
rest of the market). The previous support point according to the
stochastic was in early February, which had a range around \$18 to \$20.
Furthermore, \$18.30 is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level if we're to
go down.</p>
<p>The risk taken for this trade is \$22.7 - \$21.4 = \$1.30</p>
<p>The reward is \$21.4 - \$18.5 = \$2.90</p>
<p>Reward/Risk = 2.23</p>
<p>At 2.23, the reward/risk isn't that good. I would like to aim for at
least a 3-fold return. However, I'll let this go this time because I'm
only experimenting with this strategy. So I just want to see how it goes
and learn from it.</p>
<p>I've set my <strong>simulated order</strong> to be submitted after 10am tomorrow for
50 shares (about \$1000 paper money). We'll see what happens.</p>
<p>Update: The short entry stop order executed at 10:01:59 am and shorted
50 shares of SCSC at \$21.36, simulated.</p>
