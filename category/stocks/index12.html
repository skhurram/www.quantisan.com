            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've finally managed to offload my COF puts. This position was entered
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-cof-100-sep-09-35-put-1-90-mark-35-89/">two weeks ago at 1.90</a>, mark 35.89. The <strong>total loss is \$60 +
\$15</strong>. This is yet another poor trade because I didn't exit when my
stop was hit. This has been happening way too often lately while I'm
trying to catch the top (another big mistake). While it might be
obvious, but it's now clear to me that playing with a limited capital is
detrimental to my trading psychology. The commission is too much in
comparison to my position size. So I was often inclined to hold when I
should have been nimble.</p>
<p>The market finally moved downward with a sizable move today. S&amp;P500
tanked 20 points in an hour this morning. However, on a second test of
the 1000 level, I noticed a divergence on the TICK and COF wasn't making
a low like the market. That's when I decided to unload this position as
we're at the bottom of the recent channel. In addition, the long term
support at \$35.45 (Figure 2, pink line) should be a tough nut to crack
in the short term.</p>
<p>My only position left is my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-15-bc-100-sep-09-7-5-put-39-mark-9-12/">puts in BC</a>. I am now going to tie my
hands away from my trading platform and step back to developing my
trade. On the other hand, my quantitative finance work has been
progressing nicely and I should be able to publish some useful updates
soon.</p>
<p>Update: COF closed at \$35.09 today. I was early again. It's pretty
clear by now that my strategy is flawed. The more reason why I need to
put my head down and really start thinking.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Today CIBC (NYSE ticker symbol: CM) announced their 2009 Q3 results. The
day before, CIBC shares were testing \$63 (in the states). Today, after
the announcement, CIBC opened at \$60.94.</p>
<p>Before the open, Bloomberg (for example) had this headline, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aZ3Jl5_CknSc">CIBC Profit
Rises Fivefold on Capital Markets.</a> Note the wording. This is not the
same as profits is five times as before. Did they hire a lawyer to write
this?</p>
<p>After the open, in which CIBC (CM) shares gapped down about 5% (!),
headlines such as Toronto Star's<span>
[<span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder_leftContentContainer_ListWebPart_SecondTierStories2_ctl00___Title__">TSX
falls on CIBC earnings</span>][]</span> began appearing at 10:30am.</p>
<p><strong>Edited:</strong> Before I finished writing this, Toronto Star updated the
above headline to read
[<span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder_article_NavWebPart_Article_ctl00___Title__">TSX
rises as U.S. housing numbers balance CIBC
earnings</span>][<span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder_leftContentContainer_ListWebPart_SecondTierStories2_ctl00___Title__">TSX
falls on CIBC
earnings</span>]<span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder_article_NavWebPart_Article_ctl00___Title__">.
Ha! Tell that to the people that bought into CIBC at the open on the
earlier story. CIBC is still trading below \$60 at this point. Although
they would probably think CIBC is "cheap" now that it's below \$60 with
its "profit rising five fold". </span></p>
<p>The stock market tradition of buying the rumours and then selling on the
news for a stock is well known. Think of it this way, if CIBC is tanking
on this positive news now, what event do you think in the immediate
future will lift its price up? Also consider that CIBC has run from
\$27.50 in March 2009 to \$65 in July! The selling and profit-taking
pressure is simply humongous on CIBC at the moment.</p>
<p>However, what I found amusing is the flip-floppinge of tone of the media
(I guess I should get used to it by now, but no). One moment they're
spinning the story this way and before you even got through the page,
they're spinning it another way.</p>
<p>This is yet another illustration of why I think most of the financial
mass media are nothing more than glorified advertisements.</p>
<p>Update 11 am: Bloomberg changed their headline on that first link to
"<span>CIBC Profit Misses Estimates on Loan-Loss Provision". </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Update 12:30pm:</strong> CIBC broke below \$59. If it breaks below
support at \$58.42 (Figure 2), then \$52.50 is just a breath away in
this roller coaster ride. </span></p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market made a new high for the year on Friday. There's no doubt that
the current trend is very bullish with the recent relentless climb since
March. See Figure 1.</p>
<p>However, why was 1025 on the S&amp;P500 (for example) so hard to break?
Since the market doesn't operate in a vacuum. Here's a look at S&amp;P500
ETF (SPY) v. the U.S. dollar (Figure 2) and v. Gold (Figure 3) for some
insights.</p>
<p>To invest in the U.S. market is a bet on the U.S. market (well
obviously) as well as the U.S. dollar. Because we're trading with U.S.
dollar in the U.S. market, its fluctuation will affect your return too.
Figure 2 is a chart of SPY divided by the U.S. dollar index (an
aggregate of the U.S. dollar v. other major currencies). In effect, it's
a normalized SPY chart with regards to the global currencies (and thus,
more or less the economies). As you can see, we just broke through a
long term resistance at 1.30 but is testing a Fibonacci level.</p>
<p>Similarly, the value of Gold is often used as a metric for currencies.
i.e. how much money is actually worth. Figure 3 is a chart of SPY
divided by the price of Gold. In effect, a normalized SPY chart with
regards to the real value of the U.S. dollar (since price of Gold is in
U.S. dollar).</p>
<p>Figure 3 is more telling. Although we've been moving higher and higher
in the raw SPY, you can clearly see that SPY/\$GOLD has been hitting a
ceiling since July. In other words, the market is going up because the
value of U.S. dollar is going down versus the companies these equities
represent.</p>
<p>While there's been much <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32506152/ns/business-stocks_and_economy/">talk of economic recovery</a> and a new <a href="http://online.barrons.com/article/SB125089288451150335.html">bull
market</a> is already with us, I still am not convinced just yet. True,
the bears might be MIA. But all signs say that this bull we're seeing is
standing on thin ice.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My limit order was executed at the open today for Capital One Financial
(COF). I placed this yesterday at the close and totally forgot about
it...</p>
<p>While we are testing a long term resistance (Figure 1, pink trendline at
top of chart) at about \$36, there is no confirmation yet. The recent
bullish momentum could very well sweep COF along to break it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a look at S&amp;P normalized by US Dollar Index shows the
market is also pushing up against a significant resistance. I will make
another post about this after the close today as a market analysis.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the divergence in sentiment based on high yield stocks or junk
bonds v. market price is as obvious as ever. Although this has been the
case for a while now, so this perspective doesn't hold much weight
anymore. The market simply can be irrational beyond anyone's guess.</p>
<p>Entry: \$35.89</p>
<p>Stop: Above \$35.00, by next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Target: \$33, by next week.</p>
<p>I've updated my risk metric for options to incorporate the time
parameter. A more thorough analysis can be gleaned from Figure 3 with
the expected value of the options at 1, 2, and 3 weeks from now.</p>
<p>To be more precise, the Profit/Loss on August 28 is -\$41.5 if COF =
\$36, and +\$110.6 if COF = \$33.</p>
<p>So the Reward / Risk = \$110.6 / \$41.5 = 2.7 \&lt; 5. The R/R is
predictably horrible. That's why I'm setting a tight stop on this. We'll
see how today's push higher plays out and I'll probably ditch this
sooner to minimize my risk.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've finally liquidated my COF shorts. The bid/ask was 0.25/0.35 and I
placed a limit order at 0.30. It was executed immediately. This leads me
to believe we'll be heading much lower today because of the market's
eagerness to take my puts.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for dumping these puts. First, is that the August
expiry is this Friday. The time decay this week has been brutal. <strong>A new
rule for options trading is that close any long options before the last
8 days or so til expiry.</strong> From then, the time decay really accelerates.</p>
<p>Secondly, we gapped lower today at the market, but there is no follow
through to the weakness at all. In fact, the market is making a
logarithmic rise and holding above 985 on the S&amp;P by 10:30am. The TICK
has also crossed +800 multiple times; whereas the lowest we've got so
far in the TICK is -728.</p>
<p>With the support for COF at \$34.00, there is very little I have to gain
when the market overall is holding above 985 and seem to be going higher
as of now. So I've decided to dump this position.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-cof-100-aug-09-33-put-2-20-mark-32-10/">purchased these puts at 2.20 about two weeks ago</a>. Total loss.
\$380 + \$15 = \$395. This is yet another trade that got away from me. I
am now going to limit my trading until I can find my edge again.</p>
<p>One mistake I've been making is neglecting the market environment. For
one, we've been in a bull market until proven otherwise (probably not
anymore since last Friday). Second, the market has been very choppy and
trading in a range this month. These are factors that I need to consider
in my future trades.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I was saying last week, I'm <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-15-bc-100-sep-09-7-5-put-39-mark-9-12/">seeking to unload my COF shorts and PG
longs this week</a> before expiration. My opportunity came today when PG
broke \$52.50 twice but failed to hold it for long. The time decay is
eating the premium fast this week, so seeing that it's unlikely PG will
make a spike higher now, so I'm unloading my August calls for it.</p>
<p>I [bought these calls for \$0.60 last week][] to hedge my shorts. This
amounts to a loss of \$60 + \$15 = \$75.</p>
