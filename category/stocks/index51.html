<p>Just a cheap shot in the final 45 minutes of this option expiration
Friday. S&amp;P has shot up to 775 and retraced a little. The
Advance-Decline line has turned up and the TICK is strong during this
retracement. This looks like a strong setup to rally into the close.
Let's see if the market can do it. Otherwise, there goes \$62.50 into
the drain.</p>

<p>Citigroup is all over the news today. NYT:<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/business/21finance.html?ref=business">Citigroup Tries to Stop the
Drop in Its Share Price</a> and FT:<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c5cd6378-b7fe-11dd-ac6d-0000779fd18c.html">Citi board locked in talks as shares
dive</a>.</p>
<p>After failing to retake \$10 earlier in the week, C share price has gone
vertical. Since Citigroup is in-play in the market this week, this is a
great time to buy an options <a href="http://www.theoptionsguide.com/long-strangle.aspx">strangle</a> to capitalize on this
volatility. The bet here is that Citigroup would go down in flames or it
would rise back from the dead. This position will breakeven if C goes
below \$0.88 or above \$6.62. Given that C was at \$10 just days ago,
moving from \$3.44 as of now to beyond either of those range seems
viable.</p>
<p>Upside: Lots of talk about C at the moment. The stock is in-play. High
volatility is what the options strangle feed off by.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$5, we could bounce around the \$5 range</p>
<p>Downside: High volatility so options premium is expensive. The
volatility might be factored in the price already, so this \$0.88 to
\$6.62 range could be a trading range for C until expiry next month.</p>
<p>Support: errr... \$0?</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is a hedged play. I can profit if C goes up or down.
Given the extent of the situation with Citigroup, I think it's highly
likely we would break this range.</p>

<p>The possible folding of Citigroup is creating another wave of panic on
the market today. As the second biggest bank in America, this is unlike
the collapse of Lehman, WaMu, Fannie and Freddie. While the previous
institutions are also gigantic financial institutions and an integral
part of the financial system, Citigroup is different because it's a part
of the daily lives of many Americans. While I am not an economist, but I
am a consumer. I <em>personally</em> feel this is psychologically a bigger
deal.</p>
<p>However, is this a time to panic? Perhaps. But from a trader's
standpoint, I think we would be a little too late now. In hindsight,
anyone would have wished to unload the financials back in 2007. But who
am I kidding, I definitely don't have that foresight.</p>
<p>What I do notice though, is that the failed retest of \$10 for C last
Friday and this Monday was a pretty good sign that C is going down. A
failed retest of the \$8.5 level on Tuesday and Wednesday was a
confirmation. I tried to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-325/">short C</a> then but was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-350/">stopped out</a>.
Frankly, I didn't think it would be <em>this</em> bad (my target was \$7).</p>
<p>Since then, Citigroup and the market continued to decline at an
accelerated pace. Rather this is simply a case of correlation or
causality is unknown by me. It doesn't matter. The point is, even an
amateur like me saw C to be going down on Wednesday. Do you think the
professionals would have missed it? Wouldn't they know already C would
be <em>going down in flames</em>? And probably months ago too!</p>
<p>I think it's good to assume that the current panic on Citigroup trading
below the magical \$5 has been factored in the market already. So am I
saying we'll be making a reversal soon? Not really. C trading below \$5
is one thing, but there's also the bigger picture we should consider.
Would this trigger a new leg of this bear run due to a vicious spiral of
panic? Don't forget, we have recently <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-breakdown-of-a-major-multi-year-support-are-we-going-down-and-i-mean-really-down/">broken some multi-year
supports</a>. This leg of the market downturn <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/pre-market-analysis-for-november-21-2008/">still haven't eased off
yet</a>.</p>
<p>Yes we may be going down, but I believe the time for panic was over,
this is a time for finding values and positioning yourself for the
longer term (hey, it has to go up <em>some</em> time, right?). I wouldn't dare
short this market though, even a target of 600 on the S&amp;P is just 150
points away, but look at the S&amp;P chart on any time frame and you can see
the vast green pasture to the upside. The risk/reward potential just
isn't that good for a short here.</p>
<p>I believe I have learned my lesson. There is no profit in calling for
bottoms. I will wait for the market to play it out and watch the price
action for entries.</p>

<p>I have covered my FSLR Jan09 70 put as planned. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1320/">shorted it for
\$13.2</a> and covered it for \$11.90. An overnight profit of \$130 after
commission. The share price was about \$92 at the time of this trade. It
is now at \$88 as I type a few minutes later. I covered at a good time,
right at the peak of this morning gap up rush. Frankly, I'm just glad I
can cover it at a profit. I would have done the same even if it's a
loss. Better be small than big.</p>
<p>I believe my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1320/">original reasons for going long</a>
were sound for the <em>long</em> term, but I obtusely forget the fact that I
can't stand a huge potential drawdown. I am clearly still suffering from
this bottom-calling tendency. But at least I caught myself this time. I
think this is a good start to correct this costly habit.</p>
<p>Looking at the trend in this week's down leg indicate we can have a
downside to \$80 for ESLR. Entering long at yeseterday was a low
probability trade. I should have waited til \$80 or better yet, wait for
a confirmation for a rally.</p>
