This gap down today only attracted some light volume. And we're hitting
the support of \$100. Light volume on a test of a strong support isn't
good. So I'm lightening my short here since I still have my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">GE

Call me chicken, but <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/goldman-sachs-is-it-up-or-is-it-down/">this position is a bit too heavy</a> to be
comfortable.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After much waiting, Goldman Sachs (GS) is still not giving up the \$110
level. I entered my short on Monday when GS was about \$106.50. [Having
regretted it that very day as GS launched vertical upward near the close
to above \$110][]. Then yesterday, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/goldman-sachs-fooling-around-110/">GS threw a fit and made wild swings
up and down</a>, only to close near its open. Today, GS retraced more but
managed to crawl its way out of a hole back to \$112.95. Just above the
support of \$110, again.</p>
<p>After a historic 7% a day rally on Monday, this shallow pullback of both
GS and the broad market is a textbook bullish signal staring me in the
face. I can't help but feel we're going to explode upward soon. This
could very well be [THE full-blown, back-up-the-cash-truck bear rally
I've been expecting all year][]. And yet, I'm net short in my portfolio
...</p>
<p>I honestly wanted to get out of this short today and go long. As I was
saying in the last update, I've marked my mental stop at \$115, its
recent peak. But we never saw that price again. So even though
emotionally I want out, I don't have a logical reason to ditch and
switch yet. So, the waiting game continues.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I was saying this morning, I placed an order before going to work for
a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/general-electric-the-next-aig/">Apr09 11/10 strangle on General Electric</a> (GE). My limit was at
\$1.31 (total) but the morning mark started at \$1.37 and kept creeping
up. I waited until 10 am and GE slowly gained in price. It stayed above
\$11 shortly and so I checked the strangle price on the 12/11 instead.
It was about \$1.40 too. So I just changed my order from 11/10 to 12/11
and upped my limit to meet the mid spread.</p>
<p>The risk profile for 12/11 is definitely different than 11/10. 11/10
would have been a good neutral position because GE is obviously
congested around the \$10.xx range. The 12/11 range is more short-heavy
because GE was only around \$11.07 when I entered. It's at the top of a
trading range. However, I took it anyway because I'm actually leaning to
the short side, in case you haven't noticed...</p>
<p>As you can see from Figure 1, daily on left and weekly on right, \$10.5
is a major long term pivot point. We are testing it at the moment on
weak volumn. Figure 2 shows the hourly on left and daily on right. As I
was saying this morning, GE's rally in March looks weaker as compared to
S&amp;P 500. The 10d MA haven't even crossed the 40d MA yet. Add to that,
last time the indicators were at this almost overbought level was last
year in the \$15 range. You can see what happened to that afterward. GE
skidded down to \$6.</p>
<p>However, we have broken that long term downtrend, see Figure 3. And
we're forming a long flag. This is definitely a glaringly bullish sign.
After all, we can't keep using the same channel forever.</p>
<p>Rather long or short, the important point is that GE is at a major
junction right now. Although I'm favouring the short side, but from
observing the action of the market in the past few days, there's also a
good chance GE will get lifted along with the rest of the market soon.
That's why I've put on a strangle to take advantage of both the long and
the short prospects.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>On another note,<a href="http://xtrends.blogspot.com/2009/03/what-will-be-different-this-time.html">xTrends pointed to GE</a> as being a great upcoming
short play. Look at the long term chart below, daily on left and weekly
on right.</p>
<p>First on the daily to the left, we have increasing price and decreasing
volume since the climb from the bottom. Stochastic is making a bearish
crossover in the upper half (would have been nice if it's higher). And
every time it does that in the past year, GE goes sliding down. Volume
weighted MACD is also showing a negative divergence. GE is stalling
above \$10 but its V-MACD is higher than previously in the \$10 zone.</p>
<p>As for the weekly chart on the right, it's obvious GE is in a major
downtrend. And so is everything else. However, compared to the S&amp;P 500
it is certainly lagging on this recent rally in the past month or so.
That is certainly a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>Update: I like it enough that I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">entered a strangle order for GE
around \$10-11</a>. It's going to pop one way or the other.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>No, I haven't unloaded my GS short yet. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-gs-100-apr-09-105-put-872/">I said I would unload it if GS
manage to stay above \$110</a>. But it closed at \$110.60 yesterday. I
can live with a \$0.60 difference.</p>
<p>I watched GS for most of the day yesterday. It's action above \$110 seem
a bit lackluster. Looking at the chart, particularly the daily, you can
see the sword-like candlestick from yesterday. There's probably a name
for it, but I don't remember. Add to that, S&amp;P500 just tested 820
resistance yesterday.</p>
<p>GS's move above \$110 is certainly interesting. The correct play would
be for it to break below \$110 and then observe the pullback, then if
it's weak, that would have been the right time to pound on the short
selling button. Or we could just buy a strangle at this point...</p>
<p>Since I entered pre-maturely on Monday, I'm going to wait this out
because the risk/reward ratio is still very high. At least now I know
\$115 would be my stop and my potential loss.</p>
