            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Right on the heel of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-250-hod-to-10-59-0-95-loss/">my oil short loss</a>, I am taking another stab at
shorting the market. This one is Barrick Gold (ABX.TO). I am moving away
from shorting financials because the puts premium are almost doubled
that of the calls! It seems that too many people are betting the banks
will take a hit in the next fall. In the long term, ABX.TO appears to be
in an up trend. However, the intermediate trend is turning negative as
shown in Figure 1. \$45 is an obvious resistance for ABX.TO. Even with
today's positive market moves, ABX.TO fail to catch on the bullish wave
and only touched \$44.86 in the morning optimism (Figure 2). Who knows,
perhaps it might break it sooner than later. But the reward/risk is
decent to short ABX.TO seeing that the \$45 resistance is right above.</p>

(ABX.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-06-10-ABX.TO.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>I will give it a month's time to move below \$44.00. Worst case stop
loss is \$2.50 on the premium. That is (\$2.50 - \$4.00) x 100 x 3 =
-\$450 - \$12.95 x 2 = \$475.90 = 5% of account total. My mental stop is
\$3.00 on the premium. Which is about 3.3% of my account total.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Oil broke above \$75 resistance overnight. So my Horizons BetaPro Crude
Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) gapped down below my 10.60 mental stop at the
open. I watched the U.S. DB Oil Fund (DBO) price actions this morning to
time my exit as shown on Figure 1. While the price gapped beyond my
stop, the volume was weak this morning (Figure 1). HOD.TO traded below
\$10.40 on the gap momentum but I held on because of the low volume.
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="U.S. DB Oil Fund
(DBO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-06-10-DBO_intra.gif" />][][/caption] I waited and waited until DBO traded near
24.50. This is a short term support level as shown in Figure 1. This was
also the equivalent of my previous stop loss for HOD.TO at \$10.60. Even
though I believe this is a stop hunt for the oil shorts because of the
lackluster volume, I am not one to argue with my plan. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-92/">pegged my
mental stop at 10.60 at the time of entry</a>. HOD.TO broke below my stop
price. I had three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ditch it at whatever price I can get.</li>
<li>Exit on retracement to my original stop price.</li>
<li>Exit on break-even.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the reasons as discussed above, I picked option #2. Here's a
calculation of my loss for this trade. (\$10.59 - \$10.92) * 250 shares
= -\$82.5 - \$9.90 commission = -\$92.40 = -0.95% loss of account total.
In any case, it looks as though my initial low-ball bid at 10.50 was a
good entry point. I shouldn't have gotten impatient and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-92/">entered at a
short-term resistance price level</a>.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I shorted oil using a Horizons BetaPro ETF (HOD.TO) at \$10.92 purchase
price for 250 shares. Spot crude oil is about \$74.75 at the time. US DB
Oil Fund (DBO), which is my proxy for my oil trades, is trading around
\$24.35 at the time of this entry. This is just below previous
support-turned-resistance at \$25. See Figure 1.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="U.S. DB Oil Fund

<p>This position is also my bet on an equities downturn soon. I considered
buying puts (shorting) on Barrick Gold (ABX.TO), but I chose to be more
conservative with a smaller position in HOD.TO instead.</p>
<p>I actually opened a low-ball offer on HOD.TO at 10.60 in the morning.
But seeing that HOD.TO never touched below 10.70 today, I got impatient
and executed a market order when I saw it edging above its trading
range.</p>
<p>My stop for this position is 10.60. Risk is \$0.32 x 250 = 80 + \$9.90
commission. Which is about 0.92% of my RRSP trading account. This is
more in-line with my preferred risk level than my recent options trades.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market seem ready to crack but it is not. So I am taking profit on
my CIBC short here on a weaker volumn retest of the \$70.50 support
(Figure 1). I bought <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cm-to-10oct-puts-5-00-mark-74-02/">3 puts contracts four weeks ago at \$5.00</a> when
CM was trading at \$74.02. Then I [added 3 more contracts with the same
strike price and expiry for \$5.65][] when CM was trading at \$72.30.
The average cost was \$5.35. Thus, profit is \$750 - (\$12.95 + \$3.00)
x 2 = \$718.10 = 8.0% of total account.</p>

<p>This is the last of my positions. I have no more outstanding position in
any market. CM.TO looks to be on the brink of a collapse. I may be
making a mistake here by offloading my shorts before the fireworks.
However, as I was saying, the market is still hanging on. Furthermore,
there's a positive divergence for CM.TO as shown on Figure 2 according
to the oscillator at the top of the chart. So I am taking profit now to
reduce my risk as this position is relatively big for my small RRSP
trading account.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my crude oil short with Horizons BetaPro Bear Plus (HOD.TO) at
\$11.94. Purchase <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-11-11/">price was \$11.11 from yesterday</a>. I don't think
this is the end of the oil bear run yet. However, I couldn't give up a
10% gain (totalling 2.2% in account) in one day. Besides, it is Friday
so I would rather take some profits off the table before the weekend.
Profit is \$207.50 - \$4.95 x 2 = \$197.60. The maximum potential risk
was \$152.50 based on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-11-11/">my stop calculation</a>. Thus, the realized reward/risk ratio is 197.60/152.50 =
1.30. It's alright but not that good as I usually aim for 1.50 at least.
Here are the main reasons for my exit. Figure 1 shows the chart of crude
oil. Note that it is end-of-day data only so today's massive drop is not
shown. I marked my exit price of \$71.00 (crude oil) 0n the chart. See
that this price is a support level in the long term.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the intraday chart of U.S. DB Oil Fund (DBO). Notice the
weak volume on the second test of 23.70 support level. This figure was
captured at the time of my exit. DBO traded below 23.70 and HOD.TO
traded above 12.00 as I am writing this. Let's see if they can stay that
way.</p>

planned on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-380-hnd-to-7-35/">my previous break-even trade</a>. The U.S. Natural Gas Fund

support as I'm writing this and is now trading down to \$6.38. My mental
stop is at \$6.20 and hard stop is \$6.00. Figure 2 shows the intraday
chart of HND.TO as the time of my entry. My risk for this trade is
(\$6.51 - \$6.00) * 250 shares = \$127.50 = 1.4% of my RRSP trading
account. This should be the last of my new position for a while. I have
enough on the table with my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cm-10oct-puts-74-00-5-65-mark-72-30/">CM.TO</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-11-11/">HOD.TO</a>, and this. My goal now
