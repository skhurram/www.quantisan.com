            <div class="article-content"> <p>China not-so-surprised the market (their delayed Treasury report was a
hint) with a 0.25% rate hike overnight (WSJ: <a href="http://on.wsj.com/afczTG">China Raises Interest
Rates</a>). The US Dollar shot up, precious metals took a big hit. I
close my gold short soon after the TSX market open to collect some quick
profit. Rinse and repeat. I did mention that this trade is a short term
swing. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-am-sorry-my-precious-bought-350-hgd-to-10-26/">bought this Horizons BetaPro Gold Bear Plus (HGD.TO)</a>, a
leveraged gold short, on Friday and unloaded it this Tuesday. I fought
against my greed to hold just a little longer. But the ascending support
line on gold is too obvious to ignore (Fig. 1). Thus I closed this short
term position with this 5%+ gap up while the market is still deciding
what to do. Furthermore, I noticed the equities market are holding
rather well at the open. S&amp;P500 held onto 1170 price level. Asian
markets were marginally green overnight. And even the CAC in Europe is
fighting an intraday low as the North American markets open. Thus, the
sky is not falling just yet. I figured it would take more omph to push
this market further down as we are indeed in a strong bullish move. At
the very least I am expecting some retaliation from the bulls. This
can't be this easy for the bears, can it?</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I cannot believe that I am doing this. I am shorting my favourite asset,
gold. Spot gold was trading at 1372 at the time of my short during lunch
hour (see Fig. 1). I bought 350 shares of Horizons BetaPro Gold Bear
Plus ETF (HGD.TO) to short gold. It is just more convenient to do that
in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">RRSP trading account at Questrade</a>. I am well aware of the
deteriorating value of a leveraged ETF (especially bearish ones). So I
don't intend to hold this for more than a few days. The reason for this
trade is simple. Today Bernanke made it clear that QE2 is on (WSJ:
<a href="http://on.wsj.com/atEQ2z">Bernanke Makes Case for Further Fed Moves to Boost Economy</a>).
Coincidentally, note the orchestrated weakening upward momentum across
precious metal (Fig. 1), currency (Fig. 2), and equities (Fig. 3).
Perhaps this is a matter of buy the rumour and sell the news? I am
betting that this rocket is running out of fuel. If I am wrong, I have
my stop set with a limited risk. If I am right, there's a long way down
from up here. So this trade is merely a matter of exploiting good
risk/reward. Stop is set at HGD.TO \$9.90. Anything below \$10.20 will
be a sign of caution. Maximum risk is (\$10.26 - \$9.90) * 350 = \$126
+ \$9.90 commission = \$135.90 = 1.4% of account. [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I don't know if anyone noticed, but in my previous post <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/three-obvious-reasons-to-watch-13000-on-the-tsx/">discussing the
TSX</a>, I included a chart of VIX (S&amp;P500 volatility index) versus S&amp;P
500. VIX is one of the market indicators that I can't live without.
However, as much as the Canadian and the American equity markets are
correlated, they are still separate markets. So using the VIX vs. S&amp;P500
on an analysis of the TSX is like borrowing salt from thy neighbour. But
there's no more need for that soon as TSX is finally getting its own
volatility index starting Monday (October 18)! This is to replace the MX
Implied Volatility Index (MVX) from the Montreal Exchange, which I
didn't have access to previously (aside from <a href="http://www.m-x.ca/indicesmx_mvx_en.php">data published on their
website</a>). One question I have is that the TSX VIX will be based on
TSX 60 index options activity according on their <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3D20101014_TSX-60-VIX_Volatility-Launch.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1243766536405&amp;blobheadervalue3=UTF-8">press release</a>, but
the TSX 60 index options isn't that active. So would the TSX VIX be as
efficient as the S&amp;P500 VIX? An opportunity with the introduction of TSX
VIX on the Toronto Exchange is that I can now place bets on market
volatility in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/ranking-investment-options-for-my-self-directed-rrsp/">self-directed RRSP trading account</a>. Which is
arguably more predictable than the underlying index these days... In any
case, this will be a vital market indicator for Canadian market traders.
For more information on TSX VIX, see the <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-tsx-60-vix/en/us/?indexId=sp-tsx-60-vix">product information page on
Standard &amp; Poor's</a>. And a hat tip to <a href="http://optionmatters.ca/">Option Matters</a> (Montreal
Exchange's blog on options) for this news.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Talks of QE2 (WSJ: <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/source/2010/10/13/qe2-or-titanic/">QE2 or Titanic</a> and Econbrowser: <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2010/10/why_is_the_fed.html">Why is the Fed
doing this?</a>) and earnings season are pushing the market higher and
higher. Gold is still pushing to new all time high and the dollar is
breaking to new lows. The TSX, in particular, is testing 12,700 today.
13,000 is just around the corner. 13,000 price level is the line in the
sand for the commodity-heavy TSX for three obvious reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>It marks the breakdown support level back in the 2008 crash.</li>
<li>It is the bottom of a prolonged congestion zone in much of 2007 and
    2008 before that crash.</li>
<li>And most importantly, #1 and #2 are very easy to spot on the chart
    (potentially self-fulfilling).</li>
</ol>
<p>It is likely that the TSX will be reaching 13,000 shortly in this
earnings season. However, what happens afterward is anyone's guess. At
this point, I am neither long or short for the long term. The
reward/risk isn't good for going long at this point with that much
uncertainty. And the threat of QE2 and earnings release isn't good for
going short either. I am watching the forex market closely for signs of
a direction as that is a driver of the equity market these days.</p>

steam despite gold prices hitting record high seemingly on a daily
basis. VEN.TO made another attempt to break \$11.00 resistance level at
the open but it quickly reversed (Figure 1). I upped my stop order at
the open on this third attempt because I don't want to be holding it if
it fails for the third time. I'll just sit and wait for a while to see
how this one goes. Recent low at \$10.40 is the support to watch.
Coincidentally, the 50 daily MA just crossed over the 200 MA today for a
classic bullish signal (Fig. 2). A contrarian correction (downward) to
bleed off overbought condition is in play, perhaps?</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My Ventana Gold Corp (VEN.TO) stop got filled yesterday afternoon as
gold price took a dive (Figure 1) before the Bank of England minute
today. However, the support at 10.50 look very promising as VEN.TO made
a couple of successful long tail test of that level in the last 24 hours
(Fig. 2). Seeing that the BoE has blatantly admitted to support the
bandwagon on <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-28/posen-says-bank-of-england-should-buy-more-assets-to-support-economy.html">more quantitative easing</a> (along with the FED), the
bullishness in gold is written on the wall. As such, I am re-entering my
VEN.TO position this morning with a smaller amount of shares. New stop
is a close of VEN.TO below 10.50. Volatility is expected to be high. So
I am giving it some intraday leeway to move. A hard stop is set at
10.20. Risk is thus (\$10.67 - \$10.20) * 250 = \$117.50 + \$9.90
commission = \$127.40 = 1.3% of account. For the record, previous
entries were at <a href="../bought-200-ven-to-9-74-stop-8-90/">9.74</a> and <a href="../bought-150-ven-to-10-85/">10.85</a>. My stop at 10.50 was too tight.
I am admittedly being quite aggressive here. Let's wait and see if it
pays off.</p>
