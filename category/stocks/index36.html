<p>The market is hanging by a thread at the moment. S&amp;P is trading just
above 850, a major support. I don't know if we're going to break down
from here. The probability doesn't seem to favour either way
significantly. With my deep long positions, I simply can't risk the
possibility of another meltdown in market.</p>
<p>That's why I have ditched my SAP short put to minimize my risk and to
sleep better for the rest of the option expiration week. I decided to
dump SAP because it looks like it has the most downside of all my
options holdings. I don't want to unload my equity share holdings now
because I can wait on those, otherwise I would have dumped <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/eslr/">ESLR</a> or
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/dell/">DELL</a>. SAP share price is just sitting on a major support level, and
a head and shoulder neckline too. If it breaks from here, it could
trigger a lot of stops and drop down too fast for me to cover.</p>
<p>I shorted the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-sap-100-nov-08-375-put-340/">SAP Nov 37.5 put for \$3.40</a> and just covered them for
\$4.20 (accepted the ask price). That is a major loss of \$80 + \$15
commission.</p>

<p>Just a plethora of horrible news for TCK lately. Last week on 11/11,
<a href="http://www.financialpost.com/trading_desk/mining/story.html?id=950874">Financial Post published an article</a> about it. TCK gapped down on
11/12. Even the Motley Fool has an article titled "What the Heck, Teck?"</p>
<p>TCK share price seem to be settling in \$5 - \$6. So why the heck am I
long now? Ignoring the hypes, the fundamentals of TCK still stand. See
the Motley Fool article. It has \$2.7 cash/share and 0.17 debt/equity
ratio. Granted, it took on \$9.8 billion of debt recently, about <em>4
times its current market cap.</em>!</p>
<p>The technicals though, are looking good. On the daily chart, the VW-MACD
is showing a positive divergence. The CO has reached an unprecedented
low and is just heading back up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the commodities are showing signs of a positive divergence
too.</p>
<p>Upside: In addition to the above, Max Pain is at \$30 (\$10 for CBOE
data) for November! Yes, \$30!</p>
<p>Resistance: \$6</p>
<p>Downside: Same reasons why TCK has dropped from \$30 to \$5. Possibility
of defaulting on massive loan.</p>
<p>Support: \$5</p>
<p>Bottom line: Max pain at \$30 when we're just below \$6! TCK is a
diversified miner, a value <em>producing</em> company. TCK and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/abb/">ABB</a> are now
my top choices in this struggling economy.</p>

<p>I recall somebody said that the opening is a good indication of retail
trader (the non-pros) emotions. After <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-market-crashed-friday-again-now-what/">Friday's last minute 40 point
drop on the S&amp;P</a>, things couldn't be more orderly this morning. Yes,
the opening volume is high, but it's still below that of most of the
days last week. Considering that we just witnessed a possible failed
rally on Friday, the negativity is expected. So we're continuing to
drift downward. That is expected too.</p>
<p>But with the media's doom and gloom without offering anything new over
the weekend, I had expected something worse. For example, we just broken
the 855 support (the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">61.8% fibo retracement target I mentioned</a>) as
I'm writing but the fall stopped at 850. There're a lot of <strong>hessitation
in the selling</strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all these testings of support seem like a test of
conviction to me. They look too textbook perfect to be real. I don't
know, perhaps this is the real deal and the inevitable fall is only
being held up by people like me.</p>
<p>In any case, since my prices are still well above my stops, I am not
selling on this low volume test of support just yet. There's just too
much fear going around this morning to be selling. I'd rather wait til
the afternoon. The closing hour today would be a good tell if this bear
rally has failed.</p>
<p>Update: It's 11am now and it's amazing to see that we're exhibiting the
<em>exact</em> same pattern as Friday morning ... Take a look at the updated
Figure 2. The price, the TICK, and even the A-D line are almost
identical! A late day rally and then a fake down can shake out many weak
bulls or trap some bears when everyone expects a breakdown like the late
day Friday. And then a real rally could commence? This is just wishful
thinking, don't read too much into it.</p>
<p>Update 2: S&amp;P closed right at 850 today. The market weakened in the last
hour. The prospect for a rally is looking dimmer. I hessitated to sell
my ABB short puts when it failed to break \$11.10 late in the day. I
have set my limit order too low (at bid price) and let the price got
away from me. I think this mistake is going to cost me.</p>

<p>Just when I thought I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">don't have to watch the market every hour</a> and
left for the afternoon, the S&amp;P 500 crashed 40 points in the last hour
on Friday. In particular, the move in the last 5 minutes was <em>vertical</em>
for all intents and purposes!</p>
<p>Looking at the TICK and Advance-Decline line, there doesn't seem to be a
broad sell-off as the panic-like move would suggest. This seems like a
concentrated sell-off effort. Which <em>might</em> suggest of an artificial
move directed for the G20 meeting this weekend. Read that with a grain
of salt though, this is wild speculation at best.</p>
<p>Actually, what's important is that Thursday's rally energy didn't carry
over to Friday. Notice on Figure 1 that even the mid-day 870 reversal
didn't pack much punch. We have double topped with a lower volume
weighted MACD (Figure 1). This is a bad bearing divergence. 920 would
have been a good point to unload when the volume didn't pick up. But I
was away anyway, and I doubt I would have the insight at the time to
unload.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we are still above my line in the sand at 865. And as
I've mentioned before, the TICK and A-D line are giving a neutral
reading. My short term bullishness hasn't died yet, but we could very
well retest 820 before moving up. Even worse, I am now accepting the
possiblity of continued weakness in the market due to lack of steam.
Bull shakeout or not, this pre-weekend stunt has definitely shaken many
bulls.</p>
<p>I will watch the market next week and decide what I'll do with my long
positions. At this point, I am inclined to unload my short puts some
time next week to reduce my downside. As for my calls, with just another
week until option expiration, I would rather hang on to them to position
myself for a rally. I got my calls all for dirt cheap anyway, so they
are entirely disposable if they expire next week. This is a great
example of my trading rule to <strong>always plan for the worst before
entering a trade</strong>.</p>
<p>Overall, my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">recent entries</a> are downgraded from a high reward, low
risk, high probability play to a high reward, low risk, low probability
play.</p>
<p>On a sidenote, one thing I noticed in the past two days is that there
doesn't seem to be any report from the mass media at all. The Thursday
95-point rally and Friday last minute crash were unnoticed by the
general public. These type of roller coaster volatilities seem to be
part of normal day lives nowadays.</p>

<p>The retracement from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-recollection-of-my-analysis-for-buying-when-sp-broke-down-to-820-today/">yesterday's monster reversal</a> is in progress. I
intend to take a more hands-off approach now and not have to hug my
market screen all day. It's just a more practical approach in the long
run for me.</p>
<p>So here's my after-lunch review of the market. The expected retracement
is under way. We have tested 870 on the S&amp;P and bounced off. The support
test volume was normal, but still 1/3 of yesterday's volume at about the
price level. I doubt we will break below this 870 intraday low today.</p>
<p>In particular, the pre-11am move looked good because we managed to keep
the 880 level. 880 is important because it's the resistance on Wednesday
and the first support level from yesterday's close. I didn't expect it
to hold because yesterday's 95 point move was a bit over done (like
everything else these days).</p>
<p>Even if the market breaks lower from here, we still have my mental
supporting line of SPY \$86.5 (high of the 30 min with the 2nd highest
volume time slot yesterday) and the fibonacci 61.8% of \$85.82 on the
SPY.</p>
<p>I will probably be off for the rest of the day. I haven't sold anything
yet, since we are in a retracement mode and the test looks strong so
far. I'd rather <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">sell on strength as planned</a>. It looks like we will
zig zag up from here at least for a few days.</p>
<p>Today's close will provide a sign of what I'll do with my positions next
week.</p>

<p>Another busy day today. I usually write up my entry/exit posts
immediately for my trades, but I needed to keep my eyes on the market
due to the fact that I went all in today.</p>
<p>I'm really tired after a long day and the fact that I went swimming
right after the close. So I'll cut myself some slack and refer you to my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-recollection-of-my-analysis-for-buying-when-sp-broke-down-to-820-today/">market analysis post from today</a> instead. Long story short, I entered
long because of the low volume retest of major support. I held because
the price and volume showed strength in testing the resistance
throughout the day.</p>
<p>I am heavy on ABB because S&amp;P broke down to 820 and ABB is still above
the Oct low of \$10. It has held on triumphantly in this leg of market
selloff. Refer to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-170/">ABB entry yesterday for a more detailed analysis
of the company</a>.</p>
<p>I added to SLW because the commodities are showing some strength too. I
have been a fan of SLW for a while, take a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">look at those posts for my
opinions of SLW</a>.</p>
<p>My plan now will be as usual, I will unload into strength starting with
my weakess position and work my way up.</p>
<p>There're a lot I want to write down, but my mind is blank now. So I'll
leave this as is.</p>
