            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After holding SLW for a few weeks, I'm finally out for now. I have
traded in and out of SLW for the past few months. So there isn't an
exact price and date of entry for these 246 shares. The effective
purchase price was about \$3.50.</p>
<p>As I noted more than a few times in the past, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">I love SLW</a>. I intended
to hold it as my core position for the long term. However, as I have
learned the hard way, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/auto-bailout-shakeout-december-13-2008/">buy-and-hold isn't an effective strategy</a> in
the current market condition. So I've decided to sell my SLW on some
significant weakness.</p>
<p>From Figure 1, SLW has tested the long term resistance (from 2007) of
\$7 twice recently. We still haven't broken it despite <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2008-post-holiday-market-analysis/">S&amp;P 500 breaking
its own resistance</a>. Moreover, we can see from Figure 2 that this
second top is a lot weaker across the indicators. So this is effectively
a double top formation, for now.</p>
<p>I still have my reserve on this because it is a holiday week, so low
volume is expected. Thus, I would watch for SLW's action next week and
see if it can break \$7 and then get back in at a higher price. I'd
rather miss out on a \$1 or even \$2 than watch it make a double top. I
have nearly doubled on this trade so I'm just trying not to be greedy.</p>
<p>However, there is a possibility that we might gap up from here and
rocket higher next week. If that's the case, I will probably not chase
it and look for another trade (TCK looks good).</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>DUG broke my \$25 stop yesterday. I gave it some room because of the
recent \$6 / share distribution on Dec 22. So that effectively shifted
the chart by 6 points. However, the Crude Oil broke above it's 20-day MA
and is showing signs of strength, Figure 2. So I decided to get out of
DUG as my short hedge and move into SKF.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-34-dug-3000/">DUG shares were bought for \$30</a>. Distribution was \$6.06. So my
net lost per share on this trade is [(\$23.44 + \$6.06) - \$30] =
-\$0.5. Which is a total loss of \$0.5 * 34 = \$17 + \$10 commission.
It's basically a breakeven trade.</p>

<p>As I was saying, I replaced DUG with SKF as my short hedge. We are
testing the Oct support on SKF. Furthermore, despite the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2008-post-holiday-market-analysis/">S&amp;P breaking
above the down channel this week</a> and along with SKF's distribution,
SKF is still above the psychological 100 level.</p>

<p>Stop: \$96, the October support.</p>
<p>Target: \$120, a congestion zone.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is merely a short hedge play so I actualy don't hope
for big gains on this.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm technically still on holiday until January 12, so I'll keep my posts
short. I almost didn't want to write at all, but I feel that recent
market action has been noteworthy. So here it is.</p>
<p>The Christmas/New Year week has been nothing but up with next to nothing
volume in the markets. However, we have finally broken our recent
downtrend from October. See Figure 1. The next obvious target is 1000 on
the S&amp;P. However, because of the holiday low volume, I wouldn't bet my
farm on this move. Furthermore, on both of these breakout days in the
past 2 days, we have significant end-of-day sell-offs, see Figure 2.</p>
<p>In addition, the indicators are showing signs of weakness. However, that
can be explained by my use of volume weighted indicators. This
low-volume holiday week upmove would no doubt be read as weak by my
indicators.</p>
<p>All in all, I would just intrepret last week's action as noise in
general. The breakout confirmation should happen early next week. And
it's an obvious one at that, we'll just need to see if we can hold above
the channel.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've nearly pulled the trigger today on adding some shorts. Then I
decided against it because there's no action in the market and no good
confirmation. My 50% long, 25% short, and 25% cash distribution seems
alright for now. But Figure 1 below leads me to want to add more to the
short side.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 1, the market is still clearly in a downtrend.
Moreover, we are at the top end of the channel. So shorting at this
point has a good risk/reward ratio.</p>

<p>In particular, Goldman Sachs in Figure 2 seems like a decent play.</p>

<p>But as I was saying, I'd rather wait for GS to break the triangle first
before making a move. With the current market, it's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/auto-bailout-shakeout-december-13-2008/">better to be late
than early</a>.</p> </div>
