            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Earnings season is approaching as the first quarter of 2010 comes to a
close this week. In April, companies will try to woo us with their
numbers and outlooks. With the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-first-analysis-of-the-sptsx-60-index/">market looking so toppy</a> already, how
will the market react? Consider Figure 1. Past 3 earnings season since
the epic rally from March of 2009 have consistently been followed by
market corrections (blue lines). Will we see the same selloff in a
couple of weeks? As the Shocked Investor points out, "... positive
surprises will be harder and harder to come by. Given that the markets
are even more overvalued now, there is <a href="http://shockedinvestor.blogspot.com/2010/03/markets-drop-during-earnings-season.html">reason to expect similar
behavior</a>." On the other hand, this quarter's earnings report will be
the first time in which the year-over-year value will be compared to <em>a
period in the worst of the fallout</em> (see Q1 of 2009 in Figure 1). As
such, it will no doubt be easier to paint a pretty picture as anything
compared to an apocalypse will look good. With the market squeezed
between the bulls and the bears entering earnings releases, the next few
weeks should be interesting.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>A bank making an all-time high! Another reason not to short this market
<em>just yet</em>. However, the fact this made the news is a tempting short
prospect. I just saw TD Bank making <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/blogs/streetwise/td-bank-stock-hits-new-record/article1516929/">the headline today on Globe and
Mail</a>. TD.TO is running away from the pack. See Figure 1 on TD.TO
versus TSX Financial Index. TD is trending bullishly away from the rest
of the banks gradually since end of 2007. Why? I have no idea as I don't
follow it. Moreover, TD is making a bullish dead cross (50 over 200
moving averages) on the weekly chart of Figure 2 (marked with circle).
That is very bullish indeed. Nevertheless, there is an obvious long-term
negative divergence as TD is making a new high as shown in Figure 2.
Secondly, if you observe Figure 1 again, you will see that TD/SPTFS is
testing a strong resistance. There is evidently a conflict between the
bulls and bears. Price is telling one story and the indicators are
telling another. Either way, this stock will be a good one to watch.
Patience on the short for now... I am hunting to short something in the
energy sector. No shorting Canadian financials for me. I am not crazy.</p>

                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-first-analysis-of-the-sptsx-60-index/" rel='bookmark'>My first analysis of the S&amp;P/TSX 60 Index</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Seeing that I will be trading (not investing) the Canadian market in my
RRSP, I am starting to follow the S&amp;P/TSX 60 Index. I will adapt a
method that I have been using for the S&amp;P 500. Namely technical analysis
(price), internal sentiments (depth), and intermarket analysis (breath).
Nothing fancy, really. I will discuss my method and analysis in this
post. The goal is not to find a holy grail trading method, but to get a
feel of the ebbs and flows of the market. Let's review the TSX from
three angles. First is a standard price chart. As I was saying in the
beginning of the month, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-reason-against-stocking-into-a-registered-trading-account-this-year/">my long term view of the TSX is still
bearish</a>. The one and only condition to invalidate my bearish outlook
is that the TSX stay clear of the 12,000 resistance price level on the
weekly chart. As you can see in Figure 1 below, that hasn't happened yet
despite a continuing intermediate term (in weeks) bullishness. On the
other hand, the intermediate term up move in the market is undeniable.
The market has been making higher highs and higher lows for months now.
So the fight continues as we wait to see which side will win. The 12,000
resistance or the relentless rally.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TSX 60
weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-03-27-TSX_wkly.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows a reason for my bearishness. As the price of TSX 60 moves
up in the past few months, the percentage of companies on the TSX
Composite (representing over 70% market capitalization on the Toronto
Stock Exchange) that are over their 200 day moving average has been
forming a toppy pattern (top of Figure 2). Similarly, the 50 day moving
average percentage confirms this price divergence from a shorter term
perspective.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TSX internal
sentiment"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-03-27-TSX_internal.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-03-27-TSX_internal.png">1</a>[/caption] Lastly, I consider the dynamics between
the financial and energy sectors, two of the biggest components on the
TSX. Here is why I picked those two sectors.</p>
<p>Seeing that the financial sector is the bane of global economy in recent
months, price moves in this sector represent public risk appetite.
Conversely, the energy sector is the foundation of the Canadian economy.
As such, I use it as a crude measure of risk aversion. So a ratio
between the TSX financial index versus the TSX energy index is my way of
estimating risk appetite versus risk aversion. I call this ratio my risk
meter. Basically, a high value is good and a low value is bad.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows that the up trend in recent months is actually confirmed
by an increasing risk meter. So as much as I've been ringing the bear
bell, this rally is legitimate so far. As such, the market is decidedly
bullish in the intermediate term (as if anyone doesn't know by now).</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TSX Financial
vs. Energy"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-03-27-TSX_sectors.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-03-27-TSX_sectors.png">2</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>In summary, my long term view is bearish but my intermediate term view
is bullish. Even though a month has passed since my last peak of the
TSX, things remain the same. The line in the sand at 12,000 is still
being fought for.</p>
<p>I will not short or long the market until a clearer scenario presents
itself.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Parity, parity, parity. That's all I hear about in Canada these days.
The <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-13/loonie-approaches-parity-on-bets-central-bank-to-increase-rates.html">media is saying</a> (Businessweek) that the strength in loonie is
due to a higher than expected inflation data and so a possible rise in
our interest rate by the Bank of Canada this year is in the cards. But
that's just part of the story. As I was saying in my previous post,
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-should-i-care-about-other-markets-if-i-only-trade-___/">markets don't operate in a vacuum</a>. The biggest news so far this year
on the global economy is the Greece bailout. Or more specifically, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2010/03/18/is-there-a-greece-bailout/">is
there a bailout</a> (WSJ) and <em>by whom</em>? Greece is the 27th biggest
economy according to Wikipedia. Their GDP is 24% of Canada's. They are
by no means a small country. A default of this magnitude would have a
domino effect on the weak PIGS (Portugal, Ireland/Italy, Greece and
Spain) countries and beyond. Traders will lose confidence if Greece is
not saved. Then everyone will unload their holdings in those PIGS
countries and massive selling will drive their markets even further
down. A vicious cycle of downward spiral is thus formed in the short
term. Given that even a small time trader such as myself is aware of the
grim consequence, it is likely that Greece will be saved. So the next
question is, by whom? That is the big question which is still up in the
air and fiercely debated this month. The two candidates are the European
Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As far as
we know, the ECB doesn't seem to want to take the burden upon itself.
The European Union isn't doing exactly well lately, in case you haven't
noticed. Its best performing country, Germany, doesn't want to penalize
their hardworking taxpayers for <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?countryName=Greece&amp;countryCode=gr&amp;regionCode=eu#2116">the mistakes of Greece</a> (CIA World
Factbook). So that leaves the IMF, the last line of defense for troubled
economies. If the IMF bails out Greece, that means the United States is
on the hook too as they are the biggest economy and backer of the IMF.
Europe's problem will become an American problem too. More bailouts for
the U.S. means more spending. Having spent <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">trillions already pumping up
the financial markets</a> (U.S. debt clock) in the past couple of years,
this would tank the U.S. dollar into the abyss. Likewise, if the ECB
confirms that they will contain the problem and that IMF isn't involved.
The Euros will tank and the dollar will rise. But that's just guess work
for now. The one thing that's for sure is that a massive amount of money
will be spent to save Greece. Excessive money means inflation and higher
cost of commodities in the long run. Seeing that the Canadian market is
heavily commodity-related and that our loonie is even known as a
commodity currency, that is the reason behind why inflation is rising
fast and our economy is being propped up. Not necessarily because we are
doing terrific, but because we are sitting on a pile of gold and oil.
Real, tangible wealth in any kind of economy.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>There's another reason why I am so <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">reluctant to put money into a TFSA
trading account</a> to invest in Canadian stocks. As you know, in a
registered trading account, such as a RRSP self-directed trading account
or a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade TFSA trading account</a> (aff), you cannot short shares
and can only buy because you can't trade on margin. As such, a
registered trading account is an account for buy-only trading. It
doesn't take a genius to figure out that a buy-only trading strategy is
best used ... in a bull market. As trading wisdom goes, trade with the
trend. So the question is, are we in a bull market in 2010? Figures 1
and 2 shows the weekly chart of TSX Index and the TSX Venture Index,
respectively. Referring to Fig. 1, TSX is bumping up against some
headwind at a 12,000 resistance. Unless TSX can stay above 12,000
cleanly (a weekly low above that level at least), I am still bearish in
the market because that financial crisis back in 2008 (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-breakdown-of-a-major-multi-year-support-are-we-going-down-and-i-mean-really-down/">remember those
days</a>?) is still overshadowing long term prices and trader sentiments.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TSX,
weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-03-04-TSX_wk.png" />][][/caption] TSX Venture is depressed even more as seen
in Figure 2 below. Just look at the huge gap from current price to the
200 week moving average (red line). This isn't a good sign as lack of
interest in high-risk stocks means traders are generally cautious. Yes,
it's true that the equity market has been running up, up, and up for a
good year. However, the fact that TSX is sitting at the same level as in
2001 proves that the long term, multi-year bull market has been cleanly
broken. We might very well see pockets of multi-month rallies
materialize (like we're seeing now), but unless proven otherwise, the
long term trend is not looking green for the markets. It will not be
easy money in the stock market like back in the pre-tech bubble 1990's.
As opined by Bill Cara, the <a href="http://www.caracommunity.com/">time for buy-and-hold is gone</a>. It is
well known in the community that the coming years will be volatile with
big ups and downs. That is my little secret for moving to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">trade
forex</a>last year and the main reason why I am reluctant to set aside
money on a one-sided stock trading account. [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Brunswick Corp. (BC) stayed above \$11.00 as we began the week. I placed
a stop at Friday's high before the open today to be executed at 10:30am.
When I got back at lunch, I found that my stop was triggered as soon as
it was sent. Luckily, it was also at the time when BC retraced the
open's gain slightly. So it was a good price to be out since BC has
closed above \$12 today (Figure 1). This trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-bc-100-oct-09-12-5-put-1-95-mark-10-81/">entered last Friday
before noon at 1.95</a>, when BC was trading at 10.81. This represents a
loss of \$65. For this particular trade, I adhered to my exit strategy
(even though it was a loss), so that's good. For the entry, I could have
waited later on in the day on Friday to see how the market performs as
we approached the end of the week. If I had done that, the reward/risk
would have been better. But I think I would have entered short anyway
since the sign were pointing downward when BC hung back to around \$11
at the close after breaking above \$11.20 intraday on good volume. And
the fact hat the market was consolidating too. Looking at the long term,
BC has retraced all its loss since the dive last year. For the market,
S&amp;P500 has etched higher today too but is still about 10 points below
last week's all-year high. The volume for the overall market is
noticeably lighter too. So this uptrend can possibly continue up as not
many is riding this move. We shall see how this goes. As can be seen
from Figure 2, BC at \$12 has some resistance above to \$13. For the
lower end of the range, we have \$9.60. A break below \$9.60 would
signal a stop of this recent bull train's momentum.</p>
