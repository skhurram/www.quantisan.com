            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am disgusted by the blatant milking of investor money happening in the
stock market. Case in point, just look at the media coverage of Research
in Motion (RM.TO) before and after their earnings release yesterday. It
was just days ago when investment firms were going gaga over Research in
Motion (RM.TO). See table below for the accolade of buy recommendations.
Globe and Mail even posted the following article the day before earnings
release, "<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/expectations-high-as-rim-set-to-report/article1517857/">Expectations high as RIM set to report</a>". Then immediately
after RIM's earnings release yesterday, which was after the market close
(when only the big banks and brokers can trade amongst themselves),
headlines such Globe and Mail's "<a href="http://www.google.ca/url?q=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/rim-profit-short-of-expectations/article1519081/&amp;ei=3qa0S7qdBoWdlgeAvuhU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=news_article&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDQQqQIoAjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsvQ_j9Nk2sqDxf-40LQLxo_QGNA">RIM profit short of
expectations</a>ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â½" pops up all over the news wire. Goldman
Sachs even <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2010/04/01/rim-reactions-goldman-downgrades-to-sell/?mod=yahoo_hs">promptly downgraded RIM to a SELL</a>. Citing concerns from
Apple, Google, etc. As if the world around RIM suddenly changed within
minutes before and after their latest earnings! Not surprisingly, RIM
(on Nasdaq) traded -5% post-market last night and gapped down big today.
Anyone that bought into these sales pitch (see table) just days ago
would have been hit hard. This type of <strong>orchestrated raids</strong> from the
media and big investment firms never cease to disgust me. That is a
reason why I've taken to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">learn to trade</a> and not invest with a
buy-and-pray mentality.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Warning: Top/bottom picking is a dangerous art. I don't intend to trade
on this information myself. I did this out of pure curiosity. The
Canadian banks are an interesting phenomenon. Are they just hiding dirt
under the rug or are they really as good as our government say? Mish
Global Economic Trend Analysis posted a bearish view on <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2010/03/california-usa-vs-ontario-canada-which_29.html">California v.
Ontario</a>. Furthermore, The Baseline Scenario discussed [why the
strength of our banks is an illusion created by our government][]. As
such, on both a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/td-bank-making-headlines-with-a-new-all-time-high/">technical</a> and fundamental viewpoint, share prices of
our financial sector is way overbought. Of which, CIBC (CM.TO) seem
particularly screwed as its stock price hasn't been able to join in the
unreal rally of late. That sentiment seem to be confirmed with an
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/using-option-pain-max-pain-to-estimate-stock-price/">option pain valuation</a> as I described before. Max pain for CM.TO for
April expiration is pegged at \$72. Not surprisingly, \$72 marks a long
term support as shown in Figure 2 (blue line). A break below \$72 could
summon \$65. The data also show that there is a large open interest for
put options at the \$72 strike. Are they sold as covered puts or
something else? That I cannot tell. However, \$72 will definitely be an
important level for CM.TO in the near future. Nevertheless, as the
options market is small in Canada, I wouldn't put much weight on options
valuation for Canadian stocks. The value of open interest options on
April CM.TO is merely about the size of a single day's of equity traded.
P.S. March's max pain was \$68 one week prior to expiration. But CM.TO
closed above \$75 on March expiration. That wasn't even close.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Earnings season is approaching as the first quarter of 2010 comes to a
close this week. In April, companies will try to woo us with their
numbers and outlooks. With the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-first-analysis-of-the-sptsx-60-index/">market looking so toppy</a> already, how
will the market react? Consider Figure 1. Past 3 earnings season since
the epic rally from March of 2009 have consistently been followed by
market corrections (blue lines). Will we see the same selloff in a
couple of weeks? As the Shocked Investor points out, "... positive
surprises will be harder and harder to come by. Given that the markets
are even more overvalued now, there is <a href="http://shockedinvestor.blogspot.com/2010/03/markets-drop-during-earnings-season.html">reason to expect similar
behavior</a>." On the other hand, this quarter's earnings report will be
the first time in which the year-over-year value will be compared to <em>a
period in the worst of the fallout</em> (see Q1 of 2009 in Figure 1). As
such, it will no doubt be easier to paint a pretty picture as anything
compared to an apocalypse will look good. With the market squeezed
between the bulls and the bears entering earnings releases, the next few
weeks should be interesting.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>A bank making an all-time high! Another reason not to short this market
<em>just yet</em>. However, the fact this made the news is a tempting short
prospect. I just saw TD Bank making <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/blogs/streetwise/td-bank-stock-hits-new-record/article1516929/">the headline today on Globe and
Mail</a>. TD.TO is running away from the pack. See Figure 1 on TD.TO
versus TSX Financial Index. TD is trending bullishly away from the rest
of the banks gradually since end of 2007. Why? I have no idea as I don't
follow it. Moreover, TD is making a bullish dead cross (50 over 200
moving averages) on the weekly chart of Figure 2 (marked with circle).
That is very bullish indeed. Nevertheless, there is an obvious long-term
negative divergence as TD is making a new high as shown in Figure 2.
Secondly, if you observe Figure 1 again, you will see that TD/SPTFS is
testing a strong resistance. There is evidently a conflict between the
bulls and bears. Price is telling one story and the indicators are
telling another. Either way, this stock will be a good one to watch.
Patience on the short for now... I am hunting to short something in the
energy sector. No shorting Canadian financials for me. I am not crazy.</p>
