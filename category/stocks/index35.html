enter a paper trade. I'll just watch this one from the sideline.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am experimenting with a new trading strategy. This is a log for a
<strong>paper trade</strong> I'm taking using this strategy for the first time.</p>
<p>The new stock filter as part of this new strategy generated a list of
stocks yesterday based on options volatility. Then I hand picked
ScanSource (SCSC) in particular to watch today as it looked to be
forming a basic setup where I can recognize.</p>
<p>To be clear, the signal is for short. So this is a setup for a short
entry. Following my newly etched 3 rules, I'm not jumping in with a
market order. Instead, I'll be setting up a short entry stop and
attaching it with an exit stop on the order.</p>
<p>Following <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/end-of-the-6-week-rally-and-back-with-the-year-long-beartoday/">Monday's epic dive</a> and Tuesday's rebound, the market has
closed below 845 on Wednesday. In particular, the late day dive is
looking good for the bear. Let's see if we can break below 835 tomorrow.
In any case, I don't want to digress into a market analysis here. Just
note that for the short and intermediate terms, the market seem to be
going down. Thus, I'm looking for shorting opportunities.</p>
<p>Back to SCSC. Notice the negative divergence on the daily and weekly
indicators. Also notice that \$22.70 is a long term resistance from last
October. Thus, I'm setting a stop at \$22.70 for this trade.</p>
<p>Secondly, when should I enter? I have given the entry more leeway since
we're in a choppy market. Also, I would like to enter at an obvious
point when the stock is starting to tank. So there's a higher
probability of success. I chose the entry stop at \$21.40. It is the top
for a previous run-up on April 3. See figure 2.</p>
<p>My target is marked on Figure 2 at \$18.50. It was a major support for
January and February before the run down into the abyss for SCSC. Also,
I took into account the Stochastic information. SCSC has been in an
overbought level on the daily for almost a month now (along with the
rest of the market). The previous support point according to the
stochastic was in early February, which had a range around \$18 to \$20.
Furthermore, \$18.30 is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level if we're to
go down.</p>
<p>The risk taken for this trade is \$22.7 - \$21.4 = \$1.30</p>
<p>The reward is \$21.4 - \$18.5 = \$2.90</p>
<p>Reward/Risk = 2.23</p>
<p>At 2.23, the reward/risk isn't that good. I would like to aim for at
least a 3-fold return. However, I'll let this go this time because I'm
only experimenting with this strategy. So I just want to see how it goes
and learn from it.</p>
<p>I've set my <strong>simulated order</strong> to be submitted after 10am tomorrow for
50 shares (about \$1000 paper money). We'll see what happens.</p>
<p>Update: The short entry stop order executed at 10:01:59 am and shorted
50 shares of SCSC at \$21.36, simulated.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Yesterday was definitely a trend down day. The Monday market gapped down
huge and continued its slide. It's the only big down day we've had since
March 20.</p>
<p>Incredibly, we've managed to close below the 835 support which I've
noted <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-18-2009/">week</a> after <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-14-2009/">week</a> in the recent rally. This is definitely a
strong indication of the end of this 6-week long rally (conveniently
reminded all too often to us by the media).</p>
<p>Around 10:00 am yesterday, notice that the TICK on Figure 2 has been
trending down and then made a pop up. Yet, the price failed to budge.
The Advance-Decline line always kept sliding in the early morning. These
are early indications of the things to come yesterday. Further upside
pop on the TICK (above 500) throughout the day were basically ignored on
the price. That added to my resolve and my stop for SRS just below
yesterday's close was very safe.</p>
<p>From Figure 3, we see the VIX has bounced on a support and tested 40
yesterday. The VIX has been on a decline steadily and the rally was
unchallenged. Yesterday's move has certainly pounded in some uncertainty
at the very least on this rally.</p>
<p>Well, as discussed above, it's clear to everyone that the market will
tank today. From Figure 1, I expect 845 (recent resistances) to be the
resistance and 825 (top of downtrend, not shown here, refer to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-18-2009/">weekly
review</a>) to be the support. The line in the sand is at 835, the
long term pivot price level. Who knows, maybe the market will surprise
us again.</p>
<p>As of this moment, the ES futures is down 7.25 points. If this is to be
a strong down move, then 835 should not hold today for the sake of
momentum.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://zerohedge.blogspot.com/2009/04/vornado-to-issue-125-million-shares.html">Zero Hedge has an interesting post on VNO</a> (a component of
SRS) which might explain why SRS tanked 2 points in the last few minutes
on Tuesday. Essentially, just before the close, there were two massive
transactions with a premium above the market price, i.e. two huge trades
at \$2 above market price. A sold to B above market. Then B sold back to
A at same price. Nothing has really been traded, but VNO gets to print a
\$2 higher price for the close.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market has continued to chug along upward this week. In last week's
review, I said the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-14-2009/">market was obviously in a short term rally run</a>.
And just like last week, this up run is looking weak from the indicators
(Figure 1). Yet, as weak as it might seem, the fact is that the market
is breaking resistances one after another. We ended the week on another
significant resistance at 875 on the S&amp;P 500. This is definitely a level
to watch next week. However, do note that we have tested this level on a
lower volume on Friday. So it's likely that we'll fail to break this
resistance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, from Figure 2, you can clearly see that we've been
adhering to a tight uptrend channel formed from the beginning of March.
From that chart, we can glean that our support is about 860. Thus, our
narrow trading range is 860 - 875 in the short term for next week. And
the major levels would be 830 and 900, from long term lines shown in
Figure 2.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that we'll be seeing 830 before 900 from the weakening
rally. However, I've been proven wrong many times before. In any case,
just watch the levels I noted and let the market tell you where it is
heading.</p>

<p><strong>GICS Sectors Review</strong></p>
<p>On the 6-month and 3-month charts, it's easy to see that although the
Financials have been playing catch-up lately, they still have a lot of
grounds to make up for. The Telecoms still remain the top performer with
the Techs in the second spot.</p>
<p>Notice that on the 5-day chart, we can see the top performers
(Financials and Industrials) have retraced in the last hour for most of
the week. This is a bearish sign.</p>
