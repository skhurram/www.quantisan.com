<p>Option expiration Friday is finally here! After <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1320/">yesterday's horrific
day</a>, everyone is expecting a reversal today. Indeed, the market
futures are up overnight. S&amp;P futures broke 780 overnight and is holding
at around 765. We are probably going to open with a gap up in the market
and make an intraday rally from there. However, I wouldn't be chasing
this rally just yet. As you can see from Figure 1, we are merely
retracing the recent plunge back to the downtrend from earlier in the
week. S&amp;P 500 at 780 will be a resistance for today. 750 will be its
support. At 765, notice that we have 15 more upside points versus 15
down. This is not a good risk/reward at all.</p>
<p>Based on the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/stock-move-estimation-expiration-day-based-on-option-prices/">option pricing estimation method</a>, the S&amp;P is expected
to move within 40 points today.</p>
<p>One indicator to watch for a rally with follow through is the US Dollar
Index. As <a href="http://www.billcara.com">Bill</a> opined (yes, I read his blog religiously), \$USD will
fall if the sideline money are moving into equity. That will be the
source of a good rally. From Figure 2 below, you can see that the US
Dollar Index has dropped a bit. Yet, it is holding on at the 200 hour
bar moving average and a minor support from the recent trend. I would
like to see it breaks below 87.5 and stays there for at least an hour
before proclaiming a hold-able rally.</p>

<p>Another item of note is the rise of the precious metals. Gold has broken
the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-out-of-a-month-long-trading-range-for-gold-and-silver/">month-long triangle</a> to the upside. That's a good sign. Figure 4
shows that it has broken its hourly resistance too. We'll see if gold
can hold that gain or would this be a fake breakout of the triangle.</p>
<p>I am leaning towards nibbling at the market today on the long side with
small positions. If we see confirmation, then add slowly to the bullish
positions.</p>

<p>After breaking the 820 support on the S&amp;P 500 2 days ago, the market
dived into the abyss today as I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-breakdown-of-a-major-multi-year-support-are-we-going-down-and-i-mean-really-down/">suggested this morning</a>. Frankly, the
mid-day looked alright and I thought we wouldn't go down anymore.</p>
<p>Turns out I was wrong (I stayed on sideline as planned). The market
capitulated in the last hour. In particular, Citigroup sank to \$4.71.
My [short call at \$8.20][] would have made a killing had I not get
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-350/">stopped out</a>. Oh well, I'm not complaining. Although my portfolio is
way down, I am just glad that I managed my risk and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-195/">covered all my
short puts</a> a couple of days ago. In hindsight though, I really should
have [hedged my position][short call at \$8.20] more eagerly.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to this entry. Why? After failing to pick the bottom so
many times, why the heck am I entering now? (This is going in my rule
book, <strong>no picking top/bottom</strong>)</p>
<p>Do I think this is the bottom for FSLR? I don't know. Why did I enter
this trade? Because if offers good risk/reward and probability.</p>
<p>Upside: January 2009 expiry date with 50% probability of expiry for this
70 strike. Support is \$75 for FSLR set in 2007 but we never even came
close to it in this historic downleg in the market. Today marked a new
low of \$86. Thus, my 70 strike is a stink bid. And being paid \$13.20
for this stink bid? I compared this risk/reward to a few strong
companies I liked and this OTM put price is the highest (since I'm
shorting).</p>
<p>Resistance: \$100. But I don't really care since this is a stink bid and
I have limited upside.</p>
<p>Downside: If we do break \$75, then all hell breaks lose in this. We are
still in a severe and monumental market crash. I don't have cash to buy
the shares if this is put to me in January.</p>
<p>Support: \$75.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is a high probability trade. Stop is just below \$75.</p>
<p>
**Update:** I am going to liquidate this position tomorrow. Bill from
[BillCara.com kindly shared his insight][] on this trade.

I also didn't think this thoroughly myself. I simply cannot stomach the
potential drawdown in FSLR. Even my own trendline analysis shows it can
go to \$80 on this down run. I should wait for confirmations of strength
before heading in at this point.

<p>The 820 S&amp;P 500 level was a major 10-year support. We broke that clean
yesterday and passed the psychological 800 level. This is ugly to say
the least. A target for this downmove is about 770, possibly 680 as
indicated on Figure 1.</p>
<p>If we're to make a turnaround for a fail of this support test, a clean
break of the upper trendline on Figure 2 today or tomorrow would be
great news. With options expiration this Friday, volatility is going to
be higher, so it will be hard to distinguish simple volatility,
retracement, or real rebounds. I think the hourly trendline in Figure 2
is a good starting point as it has worked throughout the week in this
down leg.</p>
<p>This isn't the end of the world by all account. Don't let fear or your
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">hope for a rally</a> impede your trading. This is as good as time as
ever to remind yourself to <strong>watch the price action and make objective
decisions</strong>.</p>
<p>I am not going to trade this crazy market for short term swings.
Instead, I'll be looking for values and good price actions to position
myself in this few days for the next few months.</p>

<p>Well that was fast. This trade lasted only 36 minutes. I [shorted for
\$3.25][] and was stopped out for \$3.50. A lost of \$40 with
commission. I dumped my holding when my stop was hit this time. No

<p>Going long haven't been working out for me. So I'm going to stick in a
short side trade to hedge my long positions. I chose Citibank because
it's the obvious. It's a financial, and it just reported a massive 20%
cut to its workforce. While that's good news in the long run and I
typically go against the media, that strategy haven't worked well.
That's why I'm going for the blatantly obvious this time around.</p>
<p>The TICK just marked a new high for the day but we're merely testing a
local resistance. The downside seems more and more possible now. That's
why I want to hedge my longs at this point.</p>
<p>Upside: Quadriple bottom forming. The company is accepting reality and
putting in efforts to minimize future downside.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$9.5</p>
<p>Downside: We are spiralling down. Continued market weakness seen in
intraday data, Figure 2.</p>
<p>Support: \$8</p>
<p>Bottom line: This trade is opposite of my usual strategy. Going short at
a major support level is very risky. Yet, doing what i normally do
hasn't worked for the past two weeks. So I'm just going to go with the
flow and try a short side position to hedge my positions. As this is a
Nov call, this is a short term trade with a stop of C share price
\$8.40.</p>

<p>I covered my last short put. Bought ABB Nov 12.5 put for \$1.95 (bid:
\$1.8, ask \$2.05 at the time). I [shorted this ABB put at \$1.70][]. As
I've opined yesterday, things don't look good on the market. Despite <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">my
earlier optimism for a bear rally</a>, the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/monday-after-the-last-minute-market-dive-outlook-for-the-rest-of-the-day/">market obviously haven't
followed through</a>. The reality is that there's a good possibility of
another market crash at this critical support level. Thus, I have exited
today on signs of weakness.</p>
<p>On the broad market, the S&amp;P failed to push through the morning when I
made this trade. Figure 2 shows a double top at 865 with corresponding
double top in the TICK (neutral read) and lower Advance-Decline line
(bearish read).</p>
<p>Another point is that ABB today merely filled the down gap, and this
second retest of 865 on S&amp;P only led to a lower low with lower volume.
In terms of intraday move, this is very bearish.</p>
<p>So rather than sit tight and hope for the best, I unloaded this last
short put as planned to reduce my downside risk.</p>
<p>I still have plenty of long calls in ABB and others if we do rally from
here. I am still very bullish on ABB from its fundamental and signs of
big block accumulations recently. Just that with only 3 more days until
options expiration, I can't risk having the shares put to me now that
I'm low on cash from all the greedy calls buying in the last few days.</p>
