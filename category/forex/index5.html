            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>USDCAD comes to a halt at 1.0581 today. My original target was 1.05761.
A mere 5 pips difference. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">This position</a> is now +79 pips on paper. I
moved my stop to breakeven last night. Normally, I would have covered
most, if not all, of the position at this point. But I'll hold onto the
full amount this time. For now. Reasons are as follow. <!--more--></p>
<ol>
<li>USDCAD likes to grind out both bulls and bears at obvious levels</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">down move that I'm seeing</a> is still in an early
    stage.</li>
<li>My position is too small to be worthwhile if I take profit now.</li>
<li>Analysis of my recent performance shows that I often don't ride my
    winners long enough.</li>
<li>I must learn to adopt a longer term strategy now that I [can't trade
    as often][].</li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, Figure 1 shows what I mean by #2.</p>

4-hour"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-02-10-usdcad_4h.gif" />][][/caption] In fact, I intend to look for opportunities
to add to this position. As long as USDCAD stays below 1.0645, I'm
confident (not exactly the right word though) with this down move. From
this point onward, it's new territory for me as I push beyond my comfort
zone. Is this an ill-fated move or a spark of insight? Let me know what
you think about this extended trade. Update February 15: I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-usdcad-short-1-0540-for-131-pips/">closed this
trade</a> for +131 pips gain.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Perhaps third times' the charm? I tried to short USDCAD twice last week
already. Both times I've been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-out-of-usdcad-short-1-0640-for-67-pips-re-entering-1-0680/">stopped out</a> for a total of -0.2% of
account loss. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">intermediate term analysis</a> remains the same as
before. So I won't repeat myself here. Entry signal for this particular
short is shown in Figure 1. I'm just using the 4-hour chart as I have a
well defined (recent top) stop this time. I compensate with a smaller
position size to limit my risk to 0.1%. Reward / Risk = (1.05761 -
1.0671) / (1.0671 - 1.0756) = 1.11 [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

Update: It doesn't look as though Dukascopy will proceed with using MT4.
So you might as well look for another broker if you need MT4 or [learn
to use JForex][] if you plan on sticking with Dukascopy. Just received
the following news from [Dukascopy][] (attached below) regarding their
Metatrader accounts. Basically, they are raising their minimum lot-size
on MT4-enabled accounts to a mini-lot (10k). Micro-lot (1000 units)
trading remains exclusive to their basic (JForex only) accounts. Well,
why do bad news keep coming to me just when I'm about to go live with a
forex broker? First it was Oanda (although the problem was at my end
with them), then Dukascopy. There's no way I'm able to trade with a
mini-lot because of my strict [risk management][] rules. So I would be
stuck with the JForex platform for a while if I'm going to trade with
them. I like the JForex platform. It is simple, clean, easy to use, and
powerful. However, Metatrader is just substantially more popular. There
are hundreds of free scripts, indicators, and expert advisers published
at MQL4.com for me to edit to my liking. If I go with JForex, I'd have
to write everything from scratch. The whole point of me using a built-in
editor is to save time. So I might as well program in Python and use an
API if I need to go through learning JForex scripting, programming, and
testing. As much as I like [Dukascopy][] (35% commission rebate
affiliate link), ~~I may not be going through to trade with them
anymore. Unfortunate, really.~~

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well this was awful. USDCAD continued on a rampage upward and I was
caught on the wrong side of the fence. Total loss for this was 0.12% of
my account. At least I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">was light in it</a>. In retrospect, I broke my
own rule and didn't enter at one of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">4 fundamental entry points</a>.
However, after some bear rampage throughout the markets today
(Bloomberg: [Stocks Plunge on Concern Rising Debt, Job Losses Threaten
Global Recovery][]), USDCAD is at the top of my channel as shown in
Figure 1 below. So while my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">previous entry</a>
was early. USDCAD at this price is a good short. I will take it slow
this time by setting a limit order below current support on the 4-hour
at 1.0680, with a stop at 1.0750. And then adding a second chunk at
1.0640, my stopped out price. As is customarily lately, I am only
risking 0.1% of my account on the initial order. On a weekly chart,
1.0750 to 1.0810 is obviously a strong resistance for the USDCAD. It is
a congestion zone in 2007 and 2008. Then USDCAD spent the last quarter
of 2009 trying to break this resistance to no avail. But who knows,
perhaps USDCAD has had enough and it will break this resistance
decisively soon. That's why I'm only betting on this reversal with
limited risk. It's just a matter of wait and see now.</p>
