            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>CAD/JPY reached my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-cadjpy-86-88-stop-86-10-target-88-0/">target of 88.00 last Friday</a>. It broke through
88.00 nicely and tested 88.50 on Tokyo open just now. I decided to book
my profit in the demo account on this CAD/JPY long position entered at
86.88 and 87.87. See Figure 1 for the 3-hour chart with the entries and
exits marked. Main reason for my cold feet is that there's a lot of
resistance on CAD/JPY above 88.50, all the way to 90.70, from the daily
chart (not shown). I couldn't tell if CAD/JPY will continue pushing
upward or retrace. So I'm booking my profit now to observe the price
action from the sideline. This position has turned out +40 pips more
than I expected, so I'm trying not to be too greedy in this volatile
time. The net profit on this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trade</a> amounts to +0.3% of my demo
account. The yellow triangle in Figure 1 shows my exit. I risked 0.1% on
the initial entry (first blue triangle). Then added 70% more to the
position above a weak resistance level (second blue triangle) and moved
the stop on the initial size to breakeven.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I entered CADJPY long at market for 86.88 just now. This is a
continuation of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-usdcad-short-1-0540-for-131-pips/">previous USDCAD short</a> position. However, USDJPY
is on a run upward so I'm switching to go long on the loonie with yen
instead. Figure 1 shows the daily chart of CADJPY. Notice the imminent
MACD bullish crossover and the already in-play stochastic upturn. I like
it. My stop loss level is set at 86.10. It's the high of a previous peak
on February 3, two weeks ago. My target is the round number 88
resistance. 88.0 has been an important price level for CADJPY for the
past few months. So I'm setting my sight there.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="CADJPY,
daily"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-02-17-cadjpy_d.gif" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows my timing for this entry. CADJPY is noticeably meeting
some resistance at 87.50. 87.50 is also the 61.8% Fibonacci level of a
recent down move. This is a cause for concern on my long position as we
could very well retrace here. However, the bullishness of CADJPY is
apparent in Figure 2. Prices have consistently been bought for the past
few days right on the short term moving average (teal line).
Furthermore, the intermediate term moving average (orange line) is about
to cross the long term moving average (red line) as I enter this
position.</p>
<p>Lastly, gold price has taken a dive from 1130 to 1100. Meanwhile, crude
oil price is holding the 77 support nicely. Thus, this confirm my
previous view that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-change-of-wind-for-australian-dollar-shorted-audusd-0-9183-and-audcad-0-9546/">oil has better upside than gold</a> in the
intermediate term. Which is why I've been trading the loonie these past
weeks.</p>
<p>For this particular CADJPY trade, I have another buy order waiting above
current support level to add to my long position. Let's see if CADJPY
can break decisively to the upside in the next 24 hours as US and
Canadian data comes out.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Finally a profitable trade in my USDCAD short after being stopped out a
few times. My decision last week to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-short-target-hit-1-0581-trying-something-new-to-hold-for-longer/">hold this for longer</a> after
USDCAD touched my target paid off. I moved my stop closer last Thursday
evening and the order got filled on Friday. However, as I type this on
the following Monday, USDCAD is trading even lower at 1.0478. It looks
as though my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">original target of 1.0415</a> is in the cards. Even though
this is a profitable trade with a 0.17% gain in my demo account, there
is one major flaw with this short USDCAD play. I was not able to squeeze
more out of this profitable move. As I've said, this short took a few
tries. In fact, if we consider all the entires and exits of this play.
My stopped out losses totaled 0.29% and my single win here is merely
0.17%. So I'm actually at a net loss of 0.12% from all these work. My
win/loss rate is about 40% based on my review of recent forex trades. I
was able to edge out more than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">10% profit in four months</a> because
when I am wrong, I take small steps. But when I'm right, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">pile into a
position</a>. Ever since my trading environment has changed, I've been
trying to trade a longer timeframe. This USDCAD short is my first
attempt on a new strategy. Evidently, I will need to re-think and
re-learn what I've become accustomed to in the past few months. One of
the necessary trait of a successful trader is to be able to adapt.
Markets change. Traders need to evolve with the markets or they will
become obsolete. This will be a good test of myself to see if I can
re-invent myself to adapt to a changing trading environment. [caption

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Once upon a time, I was a happy forex student. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper traded</a> on
Oanda for a few months and even opened a live account with them. Then my
work place tightened up our internet firewall at work. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-to-do-when-life-gets-in-your-way-of-trading/">couldn't
access market data anymore</a> during the day. Fortunately, Dukascopy at
the time said that they'll be <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">enabling micro-lot trading</a>. So I moved
to practice with Dukascopy. Then last weekend, Dukascopy said <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/no-micro-lot-trading-at-dukascopy-metatrader-4-accounts/">no
micro-lot trading on their Metatrader 4 accounts</a>. I move to another
broker again. My last stop (so far) is at MB Trading. However, after
practicing with them for a week, I remembered why I didn't go with them
in the first place. They don't offer Canadian denominated account
currency! Fortunately, they do say that they're in the process of
enabling more account currencies. But who knows how long that might
take? My head is spinning from all this mess. I don't think I am asking
too much from a forex broker. I just want five features from them.</p>
<ol>
<li>good reputation</li>
<li>micro-lot trading</li>
<li>Metatrader platform</li>
<li>free API access</li>
<li>Canadian dollar denominated account currency</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all! Why am I being shut out everytime just when I am about to
open a live account? On top of that trouble, there's the question of
which trading platform to use. Over the past few months, I have tried
many forex brokers and their forex trading platforms. From proprietary
ones like FXTrade (Oanda), JForex (Dukascopy), and Dealbook 360 (GFT) to
the popular, third-party Metatrader 4 platform. I decided to settle with
Metatrader 4 because its charting is sufficient and scripting on it is
fairly easy. I learned MQL4 (MT4's scripting language) in a few hours
and wrote my first EA in a few days. The problem with Metatrader 4
though, is Metatrader 5. Scripts written for MT4 is incompatible on MT5.
As I intend to trade semi-automatically via expert advisors, this is a
huge problem for me. I don't want to start developing for MT4 and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">only
to have to convert everything again</a>. I thought I could evade this
MT4-MT5 dilemma with a non-American forex broker (<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143">Dukascopy</a>) as
they're more likely to stay with MT4. But now that I can't trade with
them anymore, my best potential broker is MB Trading. Which is probably
upgrading to MT5 once it's out. Note: MT5 is built for new NFA
regulations, so American brokers probably have to upgrade. I think I
have had enough moves for now. So screw this all! I will focus on
learning Python programming for the next few weeks. While waiting for MB
Trading to adopt Canadian dollar accounts (or I come across a new
broker), and the duel between Metatrader 4 and 5 is settled.</p>
