            <div class="article-content"> <p>Below is a spreadsheet of <strong>real-time</strong> (end of day data), statistically
determined maximum recommended position size for accounts in US Dollar,
Euro, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Swiss Franc, British Pound, or
Canadian Dollar. The table is for use with trading major forex pairs and
crosses in the daily timeframe. These target maximum units are based on
an at-risk amount per trade of \$100 in U.S. dollar (and numerically
equivalent in other home currencies) to expect for 2 standard deviations
(95th percentile) of the daily ranges for each of the corresponding
currency trade pair.
<iframe width="580" height="700" frameborder="0" src="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tDkmtohmo9jD1jAX_xRGegg&amp;single=true&amp;gid=19&amp;output=html&amp;widget=true"></iframe>
In case the spreadsheet data doesn't load (which happens often as there
are a lot of calculations behind it), here's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-02-07-ForexPositionSizer.png">a link to an image capture
of the table</a> taken on February 7, 2010. You can convert these
published units to correspond with your own risk appetite by multiplying
the units shown with the number of times of your own portfolio risk
amount with respect to \$100. For example, if your forex account has USD
\$25,000 and you're willing to risk 1% on each trade, that amounts to
\$250 risked per trade, which is 2.5 times of \$100. Say if you want to
trade EUR/JPY, look up EUR/JPY on Table 1 (since you're using USD) to
find that the target position size is 6175 (as of this writing). Simply
times 2.5 of that number, which equal 15,438 units. The target maximum
number of units is calculated as follow for each currency pair.</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the daily range (high - low) for the past 45 days up to
    yesterday. The data and tables are updated at the end of each day.</li>
<li>Calculate the standard deviation for the ranges.</li>
<li>Solve the formula: Units = Risk Amount / [2sigma * Quote(2nd
    currency/base currency)]</li>
</ol>
<p>Scroll the horizontal bar beneath the table to move the view to your
account's base currency. It is best if you copy and paste the data
because the connection to Google Finance is not guaranteed. So the table
might not work at times. The pairs/crosses listed in the table are as
follow: AUD/JPY, AUD/USD, CAD/JPY, EUR/CHF, EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY, EUR/USD,
GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, NZD/USD, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY. If you like this

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well, that descending trendline didn't last long for GBP/USD. I shorted
it when it was testing it and saw that the RSI was at a prior high too
(Fig. 1). I placed my order just below the short-term ascending support
to hope for a break to the downside, see Fig. 2. GBP/USD consolidated
around that short-term support for a few hours and has now broken upward
to a strong resistance at 1.6600. It's the top of a previous congestion
zone, highlighted rectangle in Fig. 1. GBP/USD at 1.666 is a very
tempting short, but never short a new high, as my rules say. So I'm
gonna wait for a few more hours with this and see how it goes. Position
size: 50% Entry: 1.634 Stop: 1.645, stopped out. Target: 1.6100 Reward /
Risk = 240 / 110 = 2.2 \&lt; 3, so only 50% position. I think I'll stick
with the 3 factor as a limit. Even these 2+ trades aren't working so
well for me because my probability of success has been low.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I placed this order to short AUD/JPY before going to bed last night. The
order was filled overnight. I have tweaked my strategy a little and this
is a first test. I think I need to start naming my strategies and giving
them version number. It will make it easier to keep track in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">my trading
log</a> and for quick comparisons. Here's what I saw to make me throw my
dice at this pair. Figure 1 is the daily and Figure 2 is the 3-hour
chart. My reasoning are as follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>AUD/JPY is testing the top of a channel, Fig. 1</li>
<li>Its RSI is pushing above 80, a level not seen since January when it
    was trading about 67.50.</li>
<li>USD/JPY tested 91 and headed downward.</li>
<li>AUD/USD heading up to the sky with a worsening divergence.</li>
<li>EUR/JPY (a recent <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-eurjpy-135-00-500-1-pips/">+500 pips trade</a>) failed to break 136 and
    showing an evident negative divergence too.</li>
<li>Short term testing of ascending support line, Fig. 2. (Should have
    given this more room though)</li>
</ol>
<p>Position size: 50%, another 50% waiting to enter below 82.90 Entry:
83.60 Stop: 85.50, see Fig. 1. Target: 77.50, bottom of channel, see
Fig. 1. Reward / Risk =610 / 190 = 3.2. The stop is a lot wider than my
previous trades because I'm finding it not worth my time to micro-manage
my trades. However, notice that my total position size is adjusted
accordingly to not risk more than 1% of my forex portfolio in a trade.
My focus is on the daily so it's only natural to give it more room as
I'm not a prophet and couldn't tell when a trade would work out. This is
one of the revision made to this strategy as learned from my recent
lessons. A trade is only as good as what you have learned from it.
Profit is only secondary.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my successful EUR/JPY long just before the weekend with a tight
stop. Notice from Figure 1 that EUR/JPY is now in overbought territory.
In addition, a negative divergence is developing on the RSI from the
recent 2 peaks also at 135.00. The best thing about this trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-eurjpy-long-100-129-99-stop-128-80/">my
entry</a>. However, I certainly didn't chop this setup the best I could.
Even though I rode this up for +500 pips, I only had a 50% position
size. There were two easily identifiable adding points which I could
have taken advantage of. When EUR/JPY broke above 132.00, which was a
clear short-term resistance, a day after my entry I should have added to
my position then because of short-term momentum. Another chance came at
132.50 or so. As shown in Figure 2, when the price retested the low end
of the channel at 132.50. Both of these opportunities would have
survived with my usual stop of 100 pips. Another disappointment was that
my second half of the position was stopped out shortly because I moved
my stop up too soon. I was confident enough when I placed the order to
enter a full position size. But my over-zealous need to reduce risk got
the better of me. I observed on a daily time frame but traded in the
3-hour. To be more accurate in pointing the finger, it was my lack of
patience that stopped out my other half of the position. Anyway, I did
rode the wave with a sufficient position size. One thing I just noticed
is the T formation in Figure 2. EUR/JPY is back to where it started a
month ago. Where it heads now is uncertain. I will keep an eye on this
pair and aim to re-enter another long in a few days. The trend is your
friend.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>This log is written about 18 hours after the entry. I entered long
USD/CAD at the market last night for a 1/4 position size. USD/CAD took a
brief run up of about 100 pips. Naturally, I moved the stop to just
above breakeven to make this a risk-free trade for over the weekend. I
entered this position for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strong support at 1.0300, Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Positive divergence of lower low, higher RSI since August.</li>
<li>Break of short-term resistance, see Fig. 2</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that both Figures were taken at the time of entry 18 hours ago.
Position size: 25% Entry: 1.02988 Stop: 1.02080 Target: 1.0550, although
1.0400 might be hard to break. Reward / Risk = 251.2 / 90.8 = 2.7 \&lt; 3.
That's why I'm only entering a 1/4 position to test the water.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>It looks as though my analysis for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-gbpjpy-in-142-861-stop-141-16/">GBP/JPY making a reversal</a> was
correct. However, my short term entry needed to be improved for me to
profit on my intermediate term analysis. In particular, I should have
looked at a major short term resistance line instead of an arbitrary
weak resisitance line as I did when I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-gbpjpy-in-142-861-stop-141-16/">entered the long
previously</a>. That didn't go so well as I was
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-out-gbpjpy-141-70-116-10-pips/">stopped out soon afterward</a> when GBP/JPY was consolidating. In
hindsight, if I'm to try for a reversal, at least wait for the price to
break a strong short term resistance and then use the recent low as the
stop. The preferred resistance line for GBP/JPY in this missed trade can
be seen in Fig. 1, which I drew many days ago and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-gbpjpy-in-142-861-stop-141-16/">also can be
seen</a> in my previous entry (Figure 2 on that
page, the higher of the 2 lines). New Figure 2 attached below shows the
bigger picture of GBP/JPY in a daily chart to see what could have
perspired. My target of 148 was spot on too!</p>
