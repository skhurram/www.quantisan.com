            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just sent in my paper work to <a href="http://fxtrade.oanda.com/">Oanda</a> to open a live forex account
with them last week. Then I heard from @InEgoVeritas the news about
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143">Dukascopy</a> (get 35% discount on commission with that link) reducing
their minimum lot size to micro-lots. After doing more research
comparing Oanda and Dukascopy in the last 24 hours, I think I will go
with Dukascopy in the long term. But I won't make the switch just yet.
Here are my reasons why. Before getting to that, I need to describe my
situation. Choosing a forex broker is like buying a car, we are all
unique and what fits me might not be right for you. Long story short
though. My goal all along is to split my funds 50/50 between interactive
trading and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading</a>. Since Oanda's API access cost \$600
per month, I was to open an additional account with <a href="http://www.mbtrading.com/">MB Trading</a> for
automated trading once I have developed something consistent. In
addition to this latest news from Dukascopy, they also lowered their
minimal opening balance down to \$5,000, and began beta testing for
Metatrader 4 recently (Update: Dukascopy abandoned MT4)! Both Oanda and
Dukascopy are very reputable forex brokers. But Dukascopy has the huge
advantage of providing a free API access. That is one big motivation for
me to go trade with them. Then I can just do everything in one account!
But as I said, I will proceed with live trading with Oanda as planned
soon (once I am out of this drawdown from being <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/early-bird-does-not-get-the-worm-in-forex-trading/">too early in shorting
Aussie</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">other pairs</a>). The reason is that Dukascopy has always
been catered towards institutional or big pocket forex traders. This
aggressive move to welcome retail traders and small timers could be good
and bad. The good part is more business and more buzz for their service,
obviously. The bad part though, is that widening the door to a new
market can turn out stinking the entire operation. It would be analogous
to Mercedes suddenly decided to compete in the budget cars market... oh
wait, they did that! (Mercedes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_B-Class">B-class</a>, enough said) More
specifically regarding Dukascopy, I am most concerned of the impact on
the quality and speed of their trading service. As well as their
customer service. Let's face it, we know that new forex traders (such as
myself) whine a lot and expect a lot for little to nothing. Since I have
my paper work done with Oanda already, it can't hurt to just wait a few
more months to see how the changes go. Nevertheless, I am thrilled of
the new changes with Dukascopy! In the mean time, I will continue to
work on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-psychology/">trading psychology</a>, and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading
strategy</a> (great plug, isn't it?). Update December 2010: I moved my
account over to Dukascopy and have been with them for a few months. So
far so good. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/jforex/">automated trading development with JForex</a> has been
going well too.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been stopped out of all my Aussie shorts on the breakout today. But
my setups for AUDUSD and AUDJPY are still intact as the resistances are
still safe. Having failed so many times in shorting AUDJPY (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">first
try</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-retrying-audjpy-short-84-52-stop-85/">second try</a>), I am taking a conservative approach on that
particular play. Although those setups are ripe for entries, I'll wait
til the test of resistances hold first before entering short again in
AUDJPY and AUDUSD. Which begs the question of, why AUDCAD, and why now?
First of all, I still have conviction about my Aussie short because of
the setups as <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">discussed previously</a> and the fact that gold
price is holding the 40 day ema at 1135 at the moment. That 40 day ema
has worked well on the uptrend in the past few months. So it should be
respected if gold is indeed in a downtrend now as I surmise. So why
short AUDCAD instead of the popular AUDUSD? Simply because AUDUSD broke
out of a short term range whereas AUDCAD is still holding as seen in the
AUDCAD 3-hour chart of Figure 1. This shows AUDCAD is weaker even when
gold is making new short term high.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUD/CAD,
3-hour"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_3h.PNG" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>For the big picture, see Figure 2 for the weekly chart of AUD/CAD. We
see that 0.98-0.99 has always been the turning point for a massive 1000+
pips selloff. We've hit 0.99 back in November and the slide is already
in progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see from Figure 2 that AUDCAD bounced off the 40 week ema
in late December and ran up to 0.95 from 0.92. 0.95 is a decidedly
important round number resistance as it was also a peak in April of
2007. You know, the time before the economy started to crack as shown
with the topping in the markets.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUDCAD,
weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD.png">1</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Now that I've established that the trend is pointing down. I still need
to time my short entry.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the daily chart of AUDCAD. In view of the above
discussion, we have a good chunk of resistance above 9550 as marked by
the purple box in Figure 3. This is the all important safety net for
this short entry. As long as AUDCAD stays below 9600, this long term
setup remains intact. And don't forget the broken uptrend line.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUDCAD,
daily"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_day.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_day.png">2</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Lastly, notice the RSI trends in both the 3-hour (Fig. 1) and daily
charts (Fig 3.), they are both showing negative divergences. Figure 1 is
my timing for this entry, see the current negative RSI divergence marked
by the downward trend in RSI versus the toppy price.</p>
<p>In summary, here are my signals for this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC setup</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Weekly chart shows downward trend.</li>
<li>Big resistance above current price on daily.</li>
<li>Broken uptrend line on daily on retracement from weekly chart.</li>
<li>Intermarket relation with gold testing 40 day ema at 1135.</li>
<li>Negative RSI divergence on 3-hour chart.</li>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">previous AUDJPY short entry</a> was early as I surmised (entered
without short-term confirmation). I made a number of ins and outs with
that trade as depicted in Figure 1. Some were winners, some were losers.
In all, it's around breakeven in that trade. However, I have re-entered
this short in AUDJPY just now at 84.52 using <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">the same long term
setup</a> (see weekly chart in that post) as
it hasn't been broken yet. Moreover, AUDJPY is in the process of making
a negative divergence on the 3-hour chart as shown in Figure 1. The key
word is "in the process". There is still a possibility of a breakout
upward from here. I am being aggressive to establish a position here
because of intermarket divergence in Aussie crosses versus gold price
overnight. See Figure 2. As you can see, gold made a marginally higher
high above 1130 on the 4-hour chart of Figure 2. Yet, neither AUDUSD nor
AUDJPY followed suit. Those two currency pairs are holding their
respective double top. The exception is EURAUD, it keeps diving
downward, but that can be accounted for by Euro weakness. It would have
been a perfect picture of EURAUD can hold its bottom though. I wouldn't
count this trade to work out just yet. That's why I'm only risking 0.2%
of my account with a small <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">position size</a> for now. As you can see
from my trade orders shown in Figure 2. I have a couple limit orders
just below the near-term supports to add to this short. My pawns have
been placed. Let's wait and see what the market does.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I haven't done one of these <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/entry/">trade analysis post</a> for weeks. So I
thought I'll start the year on this promising long term (more than a
week) trade on one of my favourite currency pairs, AUD/JPY. This entry
on shorting AUD/JPY is executed according to my Forex Trend Reversal
(FTR) setup. Figure 1 shows the weekly chart. Please excuse the mess.
There are only 3 relevant lines in addition to the price. Referring to
Figure 1, first line of note is the top of that 4-line descending
channel. Notice that 84.50 correspond with the resistance this week.
Secondly, there are 3 ascending trendlines drawn. We have a triple
X-cross on the 2 ascending and 1 descending lines at around 85.00 last
week. AUD/JPY failed to touch it. If this trade goes well, AUD/JPY
shouldn't test 85.00 again because it has missed its chance. That's
where I placed my stop. Anyway, these are just doodles on a chart, we
need confirmations. For that, let's take a look at the major Aussie
crosses and gold prices in Figure 2. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"
width="580" caption="AUD/JPY, weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-04-AUDJPY.png" />][][/caption] [caption id=""

the 4-hour charts of Figure 2. From top to bottom, Figure 2 shows
AUD/USD, EUR/AUD, AUD/JPY, and GC (gold futures). We also see that gold
prices is staying at a depressed level below 1120. This rising Aussie
but toppy gold price is a sign of divergence. Furthermore, we have a
shooting star candlestick pattern in the previous gold price bar. Gold
spiked above 1130 briefly but couldn't hold above 1120 so far. Another
plus for the short. Now that the entry signals have been met. I needed
to time my entry. This the the part that I should have done better. I
basically just shorted it at the '50 resistance without giving it much
thought. The short-term bullishness is still strong and I really should
have waited for a lower high on the 3-hour chart. Figures 3 and 4 are
the daily and 3-hour charts, respectively.</p>

smallish position in this trade at an obvious resistance level. My
intention is to add to it as long as AUD/JPY stay below 85. Also, a
safer stop should be 85.50 as seen from Figure 3 (daily). 84.40 was a
recent top in October. Lastly, I chose to short AUD/JPY instead of
AUD/USD because I have some other U.S. dollar longs already.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I had my best day-trading day this quarter on November 27. I made 95
pips in two hours at the open with only two trades. This post is a
review of my trades that day for my future reference. To save you and
myself from reading, the two reasons for this good run are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convergence of intermediate term signals with day trading signals</li>
<li>Ignoring my bearish sentiment (Dubai news) and traded what I saw
    from the prices</li>
</ol>
<p>Before moving on, let's start by setting the stage with some background
information to summarize what conditions were like that day.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The news on November 25 after NY close of <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-and-yen-buoyed-by-safe-haven-flows-2009-11-27">Dubai World delaying their
debt repayments</a> sent the dollar and yen soaring. I made <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/audjpy-short-81-3777-17-anatomy-of-my-first-400-pips-trade/">my first
400+ pips trade</a> by being at the right place and time on this panic
wave. The U.S. market was closed that day but FTSE sold off more than 3%
the day after the news. So the expectation was for US to do a catch-up
sell off when it opens again on Friday 27th. Risk aversion (equities
down, yen and dollar up) was the talk of the day. Figure 1 below shows
the charts of ES futures (e-mini S&amp;P500). Left is a 1-min. from midnight
of 27th to that morning's NYSE opening. Right is an hourly showing the
move overnight from 26th to 27th.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="ES Futures
(e-mini S&amp;P 500)"][<img alt="ES Futures (e-mini S&amp;P 500)" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-29-ES.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-29-ES.png">ES Futures (e-mini
S&amp;P 500)</a>[/caption]</p>
<h3>Intermediate term signal</h3>
<p>Figure 2 shows my intermediate term signal. EURUSD has been printing an
uptrend on the daily (not shown). Figure 2 shows that EURUSD was testing
the bottom of my channel so I should consider going long. Notice that
this is the same channel that called for the 1.5150 top on 25th. At
least it has proven itself useful once.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURUSD,
3-hour"][<img alt="EURUSD, 3-hour" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_3h.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_3h.png">EURUSD, 3-hour</a>[/caption]</p>
<h3>Short term signals</h3>
<p>For the short term signal, we need to go back to Figure 1 for the ES
charts. ES tanked 40 points over the holiday with very low volume. It
made it all the way to 1067 just before 3am on 27th. Then it lifted all
the way to 1080 at 9am. 1080 is the line in the sand for the bulls and
bears. So retracing all the way to that level before opening is
significant. This pre-open strength in ES was the sign of oversold for
me. This is the short-term confirmation I needed. I entered my first
position to long EURUSD @ 9:09 am to test the water. Then I watched both
EURUSD and ES closely for the next half hour. Once NYSE opened. I
noticed that the TICK was relatively mellow with readings around -250 to
-500. It's unusually good for a -20 points open drop on S&amp;P 500. One
would expect at least -800 readings for a strong negative sentiment. So
after watching EURUSD, ES, and TICK for about 10 minutes, I entered a
second position on a weak retracement at 9:39 am.</p>
<h3>The exits</h3>
<p>For my exit, I took profit at 1.5180 because it's the 50% Fibonacci
level and it's also the top of another of my channel (Figures 2 and 3).
After about 10 minutes of watching the 1M bars, EURUSD failed to clear
that resistance, so I took profit on the second half to go flat in this
pair just before 11 am because it's an early-closing Friday (NYSE
closing at 1pm). The gains were +95 and +93 pips for +0.27% and +0.28%
in my demo account total. Not bad for holding for 2 hours. Update:
Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jlcnuke">Jeff on Twitter</a> for the question. I updated Figure 3 with
the Fib. levels and showed the top and bottom used to draw it.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In summary, I started with an intermediate term setup that aligns with
the major trend. I observed the reaction of the markets on an important
news. Identified an oversold condition from the short-term charts for a
short-term positive divergence signal. Scaled in a position. Then added
more with another confirmation. I scaled out when the target was hit.</p>
<h3>Recommendation</h3>
<p>Once again, I could have been more aggressive on this trade. As shown in
Figure 3, 1.4920-4930 was a short-term resistance. I could have added
more to my position when that level broke, with a stop at 1.4900.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>420 pips in my demo account to be exact. Still, I feel very lucky. In
this post, I will review why I entered this position, why I added to it,
and why I exited. The goal is for myself to learn from what works and
what can I do to improve on this trade given some hindsight advantage.</p>
<h3>The Signal</h3>
<p>See Figure 1 on the daily chart of AUDJPY (first entry price pointed
with blue arrow). Notice the lower highs, with the 2nd high inside my
fChannel and the 3rd (last, just before entry) high below a yet longer
term fChannel. Plus 1 point for the lower highs and another 1 point for
the highs moving into the channels. Two points here. [caption id=""

<h3>The Choice</h3>
<p>While both AUDJPY and AUDUSD seemed promising. I focused on AUDJPY
because the Yen seemed better poised for strength. I discussed my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-use-fx-futures-to-narrow-down-which-forex-pair-to-trade/">method of choosing a better counter currency for trading</a> in another
post, so I won't discuss it here. However, as this trade became more and
more obvious and into the green, I diversified my short by adding shorts
in NZDJPY and NZDUSD. Those two netted around +100 and +250 pips also.
Another plus 1 point for picking and choosing.</p>
<h3>The Confirmation</h3>
<p>What really gave me confidence in this trade is the price action in gold
in comparison to the Aussie. Figure 2 shows the Gold Futures price (/GC,
lower left) and Australian dollar futures (/6A, middle left). Notice
that gold has been trending up steadily for days but the Aussie made a
lower low. That's a negative divergence. Plus 1 point.</p>

<h3>The Timing</h3>
<p>For timing this trade, I observed the intraday movement of AUDJPY,
EURUSD, and other related pairs. The most obvious sign of Aussie
weakness was from comparing the price action of EURUSD and AUDJPY. The
3-hour charts of EURUSD and AUDJPY are shown in Figures 3 and 4,
respectively. Notice on Nov 24 and 25, EURUSD trended higher and made a
new high. At the same time, AUDJPY barely moved on the 24th and squeezed
even more on 25th. The difference was even more noticeable when I was
watching the 30-min at the time. I had thought that my datafeed was
lagging when AUDJPY barely moved yet EURUSD was rocketing up. Plus 1
point for the 3-hour price action and then another 1 point for the
30-minute price action (not shown).</p>

<h3>The Entries and Exits</h3>
<p>Six points total for the trade, time to establish a position. You can
see my orders in Figure 4 above. My first entry was Nov 25 15:12 at
81.37 with a half position. It is marked by a yellow triangle at the
cliff beforethe dive (how lucky). I added another half that evening
23:06 at 79.94. I was waiting for a 50% retracement to 80.50 to add but
that didn't seem to be happening. So I added 1/2 when AUDJPY failed to
break 80.0 with a strategy to add another at 80.50. But 80.50 never
happened and it took another dive. My exits are determined at the time
as usual by using stops. I simply keep moving the stop along and
narrowing them once we break support level. After the move became
vertical, I zoomed out to the daily chart to view potential targets. The
77.0 and 76.00 levels (as shown in Figure 1) became my not-be-greedy
targets. I had my stops really tight at those point and even had a take
profit set for half the position at 76.0, but that level wasn't tested
before I got stopped out. The two red dots at 77.17 and 77.08 are my
stopped exits as shown in Figure 4's last bar.</p>
<h3>The Conclusion</h3>
<p>What made this lucky trade happen is that I had spent a lot of time
analyzing it from different perspectives and watching the intraday price
actions for days. I also took my time to scale in and out to minimize my
risk. To make this a habit, I will use this point counting system from
now on to help me analyze more and trade less. One thing that I'd like
to improve upon is to be more aggressive on a winning position. How?
That will be saved for another post when I figured it out.</p>
