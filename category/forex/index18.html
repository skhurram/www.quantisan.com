                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdchf-entry-10320-stop-10300/" rel='bookmark'>Paper trade:  USD/CHF entry 1.0320, stop 1.0300</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I figured I should write this sooner before the market moves more and
skew my thoughts on this entry. After my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdchf-out-at-1-03998-50-pips-and-1-03798-30-pips/">earlier entry in USD/CHF were
stopped</a> out this morning, I tried to enter once, got stopped out; and
then an even better setup appeared, so I entered again. See Figure 1.
This is a really awesome setup for the following 5 reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend is on our side as it's still pointing up.</li>
<li>Identical setup to last week's dive before the climb, same RSI, same
    candlestick</li>
<li>Bounced right at 1.031, which is at a longer term Fibonacci fan line
    as shown in Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Another support at round number 1.030, which is very near.</li>
<li>Good reward/risk ratio, see below for calculation.</li>
</ol>
<p>I entered 6000 units (2/3 position as usual) and placed the stop at
1.0300, just 20 pips away. USD/CHF climbed up to 1.0345 almost
immediately after my entry. So I moved my first stop to 1.0310
(Fibonacci level) for half my position. That got taken out minutes later
and it marked the bottom (for now) at 1.0309. I was a bit too hasten to
move my stop up for this part. See Figure 2 for my orders. One big
caveat to this entry is my tight stop at 1.0300. It is simply too
obvious of a stop price. I'd imagine the market would try to gun the
stops there before a run-up. However, if 1.030 breaks, it would ruin the
setup as described above. And if they're able to break that level, who
knows how far this can go further down. So I'm keeping my stop as is.
Anyway, I still have half of my initial position left. USD/CHF is
trading around 1.034. I don't think I'll do anything to this position
for now. I'm comfortable with just half position sitting in for the
weekend. Entry: 1.0320, Fib fan line support, see Fig 1. Stop 1: 1.031,
triggered already for a loss of 10 pips. Stop 2: 1.030, round number
support. Target: 1.038 - 1.040, starting point of this quick dive.
Reward/Risk = 60 / 20 = 3, right on the line of my goal. Although I am
secretly eyeing the 1.045 level as a target, I'll be cautious starting
from 1.038. Probably by setting a trailing stop if we do touch that. As
always, let's wait and see how this goes.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm all stopped out of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">USD/CHF positions from a couple of days
ago</a>. I considered re-entering when we failed to break 1.037 a few
minutes later. But the 1.04-1.043 range seemed heavy, so I postponed
that idea. About this trade, the maximum drawdown was terrific at a mere
0.12% (see stats below). I seem to do well with my entry. However, I'm
leaving profits on the table once again. For my second exit, USD/CHF
touched a high of 1.0451 but I was only able to get out at 1.03798.
Granted, this portion is supposed to be loose to capture bigger moves,
but that didn't happen. So once again, <strong>I need to work on my exit</strong>.
Another thing here is that my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">USD/CHF target of 1.045</a> was spot on. I wanted to exit half
my position at that level. But I couldn't figure out how to do both
target stop and stop loss at the same time after my entry order is sent.
This problem has been resolved by asking customer support at Oanda. I'm
not entering any more new trade (aside from the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-nzdusd-entry-stop-0-7040/">NZD/USD stink bid</a>
which I placed this morning) because it's Friday and I don't see anymore
obvious good setup across the board (a small board) for my 4h timeframe.
<strong>Update:</strong> Nevermind, I was eyeing 1.0350 when I got stopped out as a
entry point. USD/CHF just touched it as I'm writing this post. So I'm
back in now with a tight trailing stop... (and it doesn't seem to be
holding after just a few minutes... and it's stopped out for an
additional loss of \$4.86 on this tap.) Entry: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">1.03498, 6000
units</a> Stopped out 1:
1.03998, 3000 units Stopped out 2: 1.03798, 3000 units Net: \$14.97 +
\$8.97 Time held: 14:51:00 and 37:10:00 Max. Drawdown %: -0.12% for both
Net from Max. Gain: 102.40% and <strong>237.33%</strong></p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've placed an entry stop for NZD/USD at 0.7040. It is at the 23%
Fibonacci level and a support of the current uptrend, see Figure 1. This
would correspond with my view of strengthening US Dollar and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">USD/CHF
pushing to 1.045</a>. Entry stop: 0.7040 Trailing Stop: 0.6985 Target:
0.7170 Reward / Risk = 130 / 55 = 2.4 \&lt; 3 ... The R/R is kinda low. So
I've changed it to a 1/3 position instead of 2/3. Now, let's just wait
and see if USD can continue going up.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>USD/CHF is chalking a wide V pattern now. The up-leg has played out
nicely for 2/3 of the way. According to T-theory, USD/CHF should reach
1.045 on Monday. Furthermore, USD/CHF is testing support at the top fin
of the Fibonacci fan line as seen in Figure 1. 1.034 is also a short
term support by an up-trending line, see Figures 1 and 2. Lastly, the
current trend is up as shown by my 2-MA lines in Figure 1. In summary,
both short and intermediate trends are aligned and we're at support now,
thus, I bought when the reward/risk is favourable. Entry: 1.03498 Stop:
1.03240 Target: 1.0450 Reward / Risk = 100.2 pips / 25.8 pips = 3.9 I
initially placed my stop at 1.0295 but realized the reward/risk was
horrible. So I moved my stop up to make this a shorter timeframe play
(i.e. a quick reflex bounce). On another note, the order types at
<a href="http://www.oanda.com/">Oanda</a> (my forex broker) is severely handicapped. It only has the
basics. For example, I would have liked an order-cancel-order type so
that I can place a contingent exit at the profit target and the stop.</p>
