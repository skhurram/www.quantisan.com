            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Last night, EURCHF finally broke below the 1.5100 zone after weeks of
consolidation around the area. See Figure 1 for a daily chart of
EUR/CHF. I just happened to be looking at the charts when this breakdown
occurred last night so I made a few day trades. These scalps turned out
better than I thought because a particular technical analysis phenomenon
worked really well on this move. Referring to Figure 2, a 5-min. chart
of the move, you'll notice that I've marked some Fibonacci levels on
each of the big dive in prices. While there are several Fibonacci levels
that are notable and commonly used, I pay attention to the 50%
retracement level almost exclusively. A half retracement is easy to spot
even with the naked eyes without any technical analysis so even those
that don't use Fibonacci can see it. With this hypothesis in mind, I
shorted EURCHF a few times last night on the bounce to 50% of each of
the move. The first entry was at 1.5048. EURCHF retraced about 50% after
that big dive from 1.5080 to 1.5030. Then it formed a descending
triangle on the 1-minute with the support at 5050. A nice round number
support level. The entry was triggered near the end of the triangle and
right when it broke the support. I held on to this short looking for the
move to take us all the way down below 1.5000 since there's bound to be
lots of stops there (which never happend last night probably because of
SNB intervention). Before that though, we made another quick dive and
then retraced 50% again. I shorted some more with a limit order placed
at the 50% level before hand. So I had two positions sitting from 5048
and 5039. See Figure 2 at the bottom for a chart with the levels marked.
However, by the third dive, it is now obvious that the move down is
getting smaller and smaller. Then when the 50% level of that last move
held for like eternity, and numerous tests of resistance at 5030 failing
yet didn't back down by much every time, I took profit at 5027-5028. The
reward/risk ratio were impressive with these trades. I risked a few pips
to make 10-20 pips. However, one mistake I made which made all these
efforts wasted. Simply put, I did not have enough position size to make
these pips gained worthwhile. Being used to swing trades with much
bigger stops, I merely used my usual lot size for these trades. The
reason being that I didn't expect these to go so well since I've always
been burned by day trading and was just testing the water with these
days. Oh well, these could all have been just because I was lucky last
night. In hindsight, I could have saved myself from all that stress and
made a lot more simply by betting on SNB intervention as many traders
have done. Recall [my lesson on fundamental analysis and the SNB pegging
up the EURCHF market][]? Well, last night presented a great opportunity
to profit from that open secret again when EURCHF tested 1.5000. The
reason why I didn't go long is because it was just too obvious that SNB
would come to the rescue. I thought that they would have waited for
running the stops below 1.5000 before intervening (note to self, don't
second guess). Well, it seems that obviousness works. The optimal entry
for a long EURCHF would have started at the point when I covered for the
same reasons. I should have eased in a long position around 1.5030 with
stop at 1.5000. A reasonable profit target would have been 1.5100. Why
1.5100? Aside from that the fact that it's an obvious resistance, this
is just something I noticed while drawing up the chart for this post. In
Figure 2, I've drawn the 161.8 % Fibonacci extension levels for those 3
down moves discussed. See that they formed the reversal targets
perfectly with equally impressive textbook perfect consolidation
reaction afterwards? If the price action adhered to the Fibonacci
retracements so well as described above, it's no surprise that a Fib.
level would work well for the reversal too. Just because the same people
are probably involved with the move down as well as the move up when all
these happened within mere hours. So two lessons from last night.</p>
<ol>
<li>I should pay more attention to the 161.8% level in my analysis along
    with the 50% level in the future.</li>
<li>and more importantly, don't think the central bank (e.g. SNB) will
    not intervene just because everyone is milking them out.</li>
</ol>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-audjpy-81-22-sl-80-99-tp-82-50/">AUD/JPY long from yesterday</a> got stopped out after I moved the
exit stop to a breakeven price. Then I gave it another try once AUD/JPY
had a quick dip and recovered to 81.30 level around Tokyo noon. That has
been a time of large moves recently. My entries and exits are shown on
the 3-hour chart of AUD/JPY in Figure 1. The problem with this entry is
that the downside momentum is stronger than I thought. While being wrong
is perfectly fine in trading, I need to put more thoughts in short-term
analysis to improve my probability. In addition to the analysis which
I've done as previously discussed for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-audjpy-81-22-sl-80-99-tp-82-50/">my entry</a>, I am going to take into account yet another shorter
timeframe for my trade timing. Figure 2 shows a 30-minute chart of
AUD/JPY. Referring to Figure 2, the two blue triangles are my entries.
The two red dots are my exits from stops. In hindsight, my first entry
was about an hour early. Short-term resistance was obvious at 81.60 but
there is no short-term support shown. I should have entered either above
the resistance or when we failed to break 81.10 support the second time.
For the next few hours from 12:00 to midnight, AUD/JPY is testing that
long term resistance fChannel as shown in Figure 2. We can see that the
trendline is imposing a strong resistance on the pair as it hasn't been
able to hold more than a few bars above it. The second entry at 81.60 is
acceptable. AUD/JPY tested 81.30 again but managed to jump right back
up. Particularly if we look at the 3-hour chart of Figure 1, it would
seem that this is merely a short-term retracement from the 82.00
resistance. A stop at 81.30 as I have done has limited risk and it would
mark the line in the sand. If I'm to try going long this pair again with
this setup, I would use a half sized position only as the setup has
failed me twice already. But as can be seen in Figure 2, AUD/JPY is
failing 81.30 this morning again. This is an obvious sign of weakness in
the pair. So that's it for me for now to go long in this pair. A more
detailed log of my trades can be found on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log page</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Several major pairs are testing their support on this market correction
with a 20 points drop in the S&amp;P500 before 10 am. This is a short term
capitulation scenario. From looking at the major pairs, the long term
trend still seem to be intact. In particular, I am interested in
shorting Yen because I'm seeing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC setups</a> across the board in JPY
crosses. I compared AUD/JPY, CAD/JPY, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, and USD/JPY
pairs to decide which one to go long with. Seeing that I already have a
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-0122-sl-1-0060-tp-1-0225/">USD/CHF long position</a>, USD/JPY is out. Then EUR/JPY is out too
because of recent Euro weakness from my observations of intraday price
actions. I haven't had much luck with British Pounds, so GBP/JPY is out
too. That leaves me with my two favourites, CAD/JPY and AUD/JPY. So I
checked with USD/CAD and AUD/USD charts to see which has better
support/resistance. USD/CAD has a lot of resistance above 1.06, so going
with CAD/JPY long seem like to be less risky. However, from looking at
the 3-hour chart, I changed my mind to go with AUD/JPY long because it
is showing a positive divergence there. From the daily chart of AUD/JPY
shown in Figure 1, we can see that the up-trend is losing steam. The
price action is expected to be choppy. Long term condition, up and
choppy. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"

3-hour chart of AUD/JPY, this is where things get more clear. Notice
that AUD/JPY is testing the lower fChannel the third time in a month

down move is making this long entry very dangerous. Thus, I am using the
NYSE intraday sentiment (Fig. 3) to pin point my entry. Notice the
extreme negative open and then the intraday positive divergence as shown
by the S&amp;P500 and TICK. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500"

intraday sentiment</a>[/caption] As part of my analysis for this trade, I
compared the current scenario with earlier this month. Figure 4 is the
hourly chart of AUD/JPY when I entered this trade. Figure 5 is the
hourly chart of AUD/JPY from Nov 1st - 4th, when AUD/JPY last tested the
lower fChannel. I noticed that AUD/JPY had a tendency to break below my
fChannel by about 50 pips before reversing. With the fChannel at 81.80
today, AUD/JPY should fall to 81.30. I watched that level closely this
morning and timed my entry with the intraday sentiment as described
above. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUD/JPY,

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Seeing that this is my first commitment after the big drawdown, I'll
bring back my tradition of writing a post to log my rationale and market
conditions on this entry for later review. I sifted through the weekly
charts of all pairs on my watch-list tonight and found that USD/CHF long
is the most promising. Figure 1 shows my daily chart for the setup and
Figure 2 is a 3-hour chart with my entry timing. Let's talk about Figure
1 first. USD/CHF is making a triple bottom with a positive divergence as
shown. I have also marked the current major support at 1.0010. USD/CHF
has trade below it for about a week now but failed to break any lower.
Today is the first day when we've opened somewhat above it. Secondly,
note that we have broken above a descending channel as shown in Figure
1. USD/CHF has also tested the 1.0010 support twice already at both
sides of that channel. And accompanied with a positive divergence as I
said. The major caution as shown in Figure 1 is that we're still trading
below the 10-day ma. As for the entry timing, observe Figure 2. Notice
that USD/CHF just made a higher low outside and above the descending
fChannel (the two thicker brown lines). This is the signal for entry.
Note that the fChannel is my proprietary channel. This trade is
initiated according to my new Forex Trend Fading (FTF) setup. Position
size: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">100%</span>,
50%<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> </span> Entry: 1.0122,
from fRays signal. Stop: 1.0060, below major support Target: 1.0225,
first major resistance, ease off some at that point, add more above it.
Reward / Risk = 103 / 62 = 1.66 \&lt; 3. Not not good enough for my usual
R/R target, but I've been considering lowering it to 1.5. So lets see if
an R/R of 1.5 is a good enough number. I would have been more
comfortable with a 2.0 though. Anyway, let's see how this goes. Update:
I took half of it off at breakeven because of the lower R/R and the new
setup. Only 50% in this trade now. I'm looking to add a EUR or JPY cross
for my other half allocation. Update 11/19: I'm stopped out of this
position @ 1.0150 for +27 pips.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Having had <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-bad-eurusd-day-trading-and-what-to-do-about-it/">a hard time day trading the EUR/USD last week</a>, things
haven't been well for me this week either with the market in a gridlock.
My one and only viable setup so far is <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">built for a trending market</a>.
So this range-bound market is new territory for me as I experiment (in
hindsight, haphazardly) to come up with more profitable forex trading
setups. As you can imagine, trading without discipline is a recipe for
diaster. I have given back all the paper gain from this month by the
start of this week and is treading on thin ice with my demo account
dipping dangerously close to the November opening balance. Needless to
say, I do not want to see my account in the red for this month. But that
is what happened after today's string of failed trades. I am officially
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">in the red for this month</a>, for now. While there are several mistakes
I made resulting in this mess, I think it all boils down to one flaw in
my trading this week. Yes, those day trading stints I did surely have
put a dent in my demo account, but what's worse is that I've
unconsciously have let those losses affect my trading mentality. These
losses were stuck in my mind and my mental "goal" for this week was
recovering from them. However, I have approached the problem in the
wrong way by not wanting to lose anymore in my account. In other words,
I was afraid of losing. So how did that materially affect my trading?
Here is a simple example as illustrated in my order history on the
GBP/JPY chart attached at the bottom of this post. The 3 yellow
triangles are my short entries and the 3 red dots marks the stopped
exits. According to my setup, my original entry at 149.50 had a stop at
150.50. But I moved my stop closer to 149.80 in the morning because I
didn't want to risk more. That got taken out easily as 149.80 is within
the congestion zone. Then I tried to short it a couple more times with
tight stops because I see the downside potential to be still intact.
Those were eaten up alive too and now I don't have a position because it
would have been more foolish to keep trying in vain. While just 3 trades
wouldn't have done much damage, I was doing the same thing across the
board in shorting CAD/JPY and EUR/CAD. A few here and a few there. They
add up to a bad day. As of this writing, it looks like these pairs are
finally moving in my direction. But instead of being patient with
reasonable stops, I thought I could do better and micro-managed my
positions to end up taking multiple small losses and with nothing left
on the table to ride the move. So what is the correct way of following
up on a dent in the account? I should have done the following instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce risk exposure by limiting trade size or overall opened
    positions until I am back up.</li>
<li>Focus on what I did wrong last week and stop doing that, i.e. no
    more day trading.</li>
<li>Recall my best trades and do more of that, i.e. my one and only
    finalized setup, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not so coincidentally, now that I'm in the deepest drawdown ever, this
is as good as ever to put this emergency recovery procedure into
practice.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've stayed home from work this week because of the flu. So with spare
time on my hands, I had the urge to experiment with day trading the
forex market. Bad decision. After a good 3-4 days of day trading EUR/USD
with my demo account, here is what I have to show as illustrated in my
account balance graph for the past 4 trading sessions below.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Account balance

Nov 10-14, 2009</a>[/caption] Yes, you can push back up your dropped jaw
now. I considered not accounting for these losses in my paper trading
account because these trades were meant to be experimental only.
However, as the whole point of me paper trading the forex is to learn
and improve, I decided to keep these losses and suffer the consequences
of my own doing. Heck, I wouldn't have had the choice if this were real
money (which is the way that I should treat this demo account anyway). I
stepped out of my circle of strength (swing trading) into something that
has burned me many times before. Well guess what, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/1000-in-2-days/">history does repeat
itself</a>. Enough with lambasting myself. The real focus of this post is
to point out what I did wrong and what can I do to improve in day
trading the forex. Not that I'm intent on day trading though. This is
merely to increase my arsenal in forex trading. Figuring out what I did
wrong is actually obvious in hindsight. Figure 2 below depicts the
trades I made on Nov 13, which led to most of that steady decline in my
account balance as shown in Fig. 1. See the bounce from about 1.4820? I
kept shorting it and shorting it all the way up to 1.4880. What was I
thinking? The main reason for this epic failure is that I broke a
fundamental rule in trading. <strong>Trade what you see and what you thought</strong>
(Techniques of Tape Reading by <a href="http://www.realitytrader.com/blog/">V. Graifer</a>). Based on the previous
day's market sell-off from 1.5000 and the Asian markets failing to break
1.4900, I thought the market would follow through on Friday and break
through this 1.4820 support. In particular, just before NY open before
9:30am, EUR/USD had a couple of big drops, as shown in Fig. 2. All these
circumstances led to my believe that we'll see a weak day like
yesterday.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EUR/USD,
5m"][<img alt="EUR/USD, 5m" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_5m.PNG" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_5m.PNG">EUR/USD, 5m</a>[/caption] However, a support is
still a support until it's broken. I shouldn't keep shorting it even
though it has obviously bounced. While identifying the trend is trivial
in hindsight, what evidence did I have at the time to tell me that? The
evidence was in fact staring me in the face that morning. Figure 3 shows
part of the screen that I usually use for intra-day observation. As you
can see, S&amp;P500 rejected the previous day's close with a strong negative
TICK reading and then broke above the morning range. The TICK also
remained strong with many +800 readings in the morning. All the classic
signs that point to a strong positive trend.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="577" caption="intraday
sentiment"]<img alt="intraday sentiment" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-intraday_am.PNG" />[/caption] Furthermore, if only I had
stepped back and observed the bigger picture, as shown in Fig. 4 with a
30-minute chart, I would have seen that we have a great positive
divergence swing setup (and which I normally would have exploited if I
weren't so focused on trading the 5m that day).</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EUR/USD,
30-minute"][<img alt="EUR/USD, 30-minute" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_30m.PNG" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_30m.PNG">EUR/USD, 30-minute</a>[/caption] What
is my goal in future day trading? Instead of a declining equity curve as
in Figure 1, just flip it up-side-down and that's what would be perfect.
All I needed to change is being able to spot the right trend and ride
it. Easier said than done. So what is the moral of this story? I have
once again proven that I am still no good at day trading. Stick with
swing trades.</p>
