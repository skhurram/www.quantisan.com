            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have unofficially launched my Quantised Trading Desk (QTD) expert
system this weekend as the system is ready for live trading after almost
a year in development. You can't miss the announcement if you visit the
new frontpage of this blog. So, I won't talk about it anymore here. The
purpose of this post is to discuss my forex trade. It's been over 7
months since I've traded on the forex market. I have been working on QTD
during all these months to improve my overall trading. Anyway, let's
dive right to it for my first trade back into forex. I am bullish on the
U.S. dollar this week. Why? The Financial Times is letting on <a href="">rumours
that the US Fed is signalling an end to quantitative easing</a>.
Coincidentally, the U.S. dollar appears to be testing supports across
all major currencies. Secondly the US equities market hasn't been able
to make higher highs even as the dollar is marking new lows. Still, I'm
not one to call a bottom, nor am I hunting for one. This is merely a
good risk-reward trade to gun for an obvious move. In particular, USDJPY
appears to be the best of the bunch as its been holding well over the
past few months while the dollar crumbled. The fact that Europe and US
are rumoured to be lighting up on the money printing whereas Japan's
money printing press is on full steam for the quake reconstruction (Yen
bearish) is a decent excuse to place some chips on USDJPY. You might
have noticed, I haven't specified my entry price, amount, or stop loss
price as usual. This is because I am relying on the Quantised Trading
Desk expert system to trade USDJPY for me. QTD will monitor the market
for me and execute trade entries and exits as it sees fit to accumulate
a long position in USDJPY. All the risk management and quant analysis
are built into the system. So I don't have a position yet because I'm
waiting for QTD to do the grunt work. [caption id="attachment_5332"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Dukascopy started a new contest this month. This contest is manual
trading only on a demo account with no cash commitment by contestants.
The twist is that the ranking is determined not only by your demo
account balance, but also the total pips gained, popularity, and scoring
by Dukascopy's judges. Each trade in the contest needs to be commented
by the contestant through the JForex trading platform (when you submit
an order the platform asks you for a comment). See <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/tradercontest/?action=blog&amp;trader=Quantisan">my contest page for
comment examples</a> (shameless plug). About half of your score is based
on these trade comments as they are the basis for generating popularity
points and the Dukascopy judges' final evaluation. I can see the
potential in this contest as it offers transparency and encourages
interactions rather than let everyone just gamble away. However, most of
the trade comments now are meaningless as it's clear that you can
generate buzz simply by making ridiculous gains. Perhaps this might
change after this month's final ranking is released as it is not clear
how Dukascopy will allocate each contestant's 25% of points. The judging
by Dukascopy can effectively bump or dump you a few ranking. The
incentive to do this is the USD \$15,000 'cash' prizes to be won every
month just like the Dukascopy Strategy Contest. And similarly, these
'cash' prizes are deposited into the winner's Dukascopy trading account
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reading-the-fine-print-for-dukascopy-jforex-strategy-contest/">with a withholding period</a>. So they're forcing you to open an account
with them if you win, which is understandable as this is a marketing
effort. For information or registration in the contest, <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">visit the
Dukascopy website</a> and navigate to the Trader Contest page.</p> </div>

struggling around the descending resistance line as shown in Figure 1.
It made a higher low so I won't be surprised if it cracks higher.

<p>The reason why I took this trade was that the opportunity seemed too
good to pass on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/short-usdcad-1-0654-stop-1-077/">based on my analysis at the time</a>. I
always keep an eye on the market even when I'm not trading. Although the
basic setup remains intact, the opportunity isn't so fantastic that I
couldn't say no anymore.</p>
<p>Anyway, I shouldn't be wasting time managing a minuscule trade. Back to
staring at codes.</p>
