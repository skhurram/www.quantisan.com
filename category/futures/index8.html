enter a short now, I'll probably wait for a retracement. The ATR of
soybean is too much risk for me at the moment, each point move is \$50.
A bad day in soybean would pose a \$3000 paper lost even inside trading
range.</p>

simple system to cope with because of the noise. Yet, not all hopes are
lost. Swing and long term trading poses a viable alternative. In the 135
min. ER2 example above, the Stochastic and CCI signals I've been using
seem pretty reliable. I think I will focus on developing systems for
medium term (a few days) trading from now on.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to trade ER2 after today's lost from the Dow because of MM
manipulation. The big indexes are too easily manipulated and are drawing
too much attention. Too many professional players are involved in the
big indexes, so making a living out of them may be difficult.</p>
<p>ER2's 135 min ATR is about 6 - 7 points (\$600 - \$700 on the mini). The
swings can be about 80 points, or \$8000. This is too much for me at the
moment. So I'll have to wait until I can get more capital. I'm focusing
to trade Gold and Soybean for now.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R45cF_Y4uoI/AAAAAAAAAG0/mSL5Cg4L4_w/s400/gold_day.jpg" />][] My short on gold last night was a good call. Gold today is
below \$880. After losing a bunch on the Dow, I entered another short
position on Gold at \$882.60 out of frustration. In my mind I thought
that was a short term top from retracement. In hindsight, it was a bad
spot to go short. The indicators were in the middle and price was
inching up. It's at \$887.20 at the moment. This emotional trade could
cost me dearly. I'll see how it turns out tomorrow.</p>
<p>Update: I entered 2 more shorts at \$880.50 when the retracement seemed
weak from the indicators. I now have a total of 4 shorts on YM! I am
taking a lot of risk here because with 4 contracts, each 10 point drop
would amount to \$1300! However, I strongly believe we are at a short
term top in Gold.</p>
<p>While people are still hoping this is just a minor correction before
newer highs, the bearish signals in the daily chart are just too clear
to not plunge in.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R46FNvY4urI/AAAAAAAAAHM/Zu0vdgpeJcU/s400/gold_daily.jpg" />][]Notice the volume of the last two down days. They are near
their high as in the November correction. MACD is also turning down from
a fierce run. Stochastic is below signal line and actually crossing 80
as of today. If I might say this again, what really got me is the high
volumes in the last two trading days.</p>
<p>The combinations of these signals, alone with the current position of
the price high above the Keltner channel, has always produced
significant falls in the past year. This time, the volume is ALSO
confirmation the signal. So my guess is that this will be a big
correction to come. Probably to \$800 or even below.</p>
<p>My 4 stops are set to just above intraday highs and pivot points. If
they all hit, I'll lose about \$1500. If this plays out, short term
price should be at least back down to 20 MA level (which is also the
triangle top) at \$850. My average price is \$885.1. So a potential
profit of about \$4500. Thus, reward/risk = \$4500 / \$1500 = 3. Which
is pretty good. That's why I convinced myself to take on so many
positions.</p>
<p>Anyway, tomorrow should be a telling day as it's the 3rd day since the
initial drop. We'll see if the price recover.</p>
