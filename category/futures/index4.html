            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6I-lhzQQtI/AAAAAAAAAMs/e3JJNFik3BA/s400/er2_trade.jpg" />][]I'm starting a trade of the day series in addition to my daily
day trading report. This is to highlight a particular good or bad trade
of the day where I think it's worth documenting.</p>
<p>In this trade, both my CCI and Kelterner indicated a sell. So a double
confirmation. So I waited for an entry by looking at my fast time frame.
On the fast time frame, the price has been in Stochastic overbought zone
for like 20 bars. Then a double top came outside of Keltner at price
\$699.60, which is just below the \$700 resistance. So I entered a short
near the top, which made a triple top and placed a stop just above
\$700.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, it broke through \$700. Not good. It seemed to me
like the MM are eating up the stops. So I moved my stop up above \$701.
I was quite certain that the price is going down...</p>
<p>After just passing \$701, the price started to go down as expected.
However, it was more like drifting down and coiling up rather than a
fast breakdown. The stochastic was choppy too. So I wasn't so sure
anymore and decided it's better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>I exited my position at \$699.50 (local low wa \$698.60) when the
Stochastic was going out of the oversold zone. Soon afterward, the price
continued on its run for the day. I was very fortunate to have at least
made back the comissions.</p>
<p>Lessons from this trade:</p>
<ol>
<li>Placing stops just above weak support/resistance could easily get
    taken out.</li>
<li>If the price
    <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">hasn't
    moved</span> as intended, then re-evaluate the position and cut
    loses if things don't look good. There's always another chance.</li>
</ol>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6I6SxzQQpI/AAAAAAAAAMM/6d2AMKr4aC4/s400/er2_day.jpg" />][] What a day today. Volume was great and swings were huge too. I
had a good day today and covered my losses from yesterday. Good days
always seem to come after a bad day. I think it's probably because I'm
more calm after a losing day. So now, I just need to maintain my
composure even if I'm up.</p>
<p>MBIA had a conference call today and told everyone everything's still
good even though they are reporting a \$2.3bln loss last quarter! Go
figure! Someone at BillCara is suggesting that the fund managers are
proping the market because it's the last day of the month. Just so they
can have a positive January.</p>
<p>I traded the pre-market signal as intended and it paid off. The gap
closed as expected but I <span style="font-weight:bold;">exited too
early</span> again. If only I held longer, my profits would have been in
the 4 figures today.</p>
<p>I did well today, entering trades only when the risk/reward ratio is
deemed worthwhile. In addition, I am making use of resistance and
support levels. I think this helped a lot.</p>
<p>However, I think I need to be quicker on my decision. I found that many
times, I was still pondering should I enter and then the price have
moved already. On the other hand, my exit trigger is a bit too fast
because I'm still not letting my profit run. Thus, I think I need to
automate some of my decision making process (like adding some ShowMe's)
rather than just eyeballing my indicators. One idea I'm having is tune
my fast time period with an appropriate ShowMe. This should be something
simple. I am thinking of implementing a ShowMe for local high/low with
stochastic divergence as setup.</p>

on the recent peak, both MACD and Stochastic failed to go higher. This
could be a bearish divergence. I almost wanted to short Gold before the
FED meeting.</p>
<p>However, I entered on 4 long positions based on the fundamentals. As
Bill Cara wrote today, "Is there any doubt that the gold price is going
to advance and that liquidity will continue to dry up in global equity
markets?"</p>
<p>Another hint is that although the day opened lower, the technicals edged
higher as we approach the FED meeting time.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6DeihzQQmI/AAAAAAAAAL0/-POEn-3h4gE/s400/gold.jpg" />][]The position is in positive as I type this. However, tomorrow
should be more telling as the Asian and European decides what to make of
the 50 pts FED cut. My target is \$1000 but will probably exit by Friday
based on what happens then.</p>

pretty quiet before the announcement. Then at about 2:14pm, the price
broke up because the FED lowered interest rate another 50 pts to 3% as
expected.</p>
<p>I tried my scalping strategy explained a few days ago, it didn't work!
After losing about \$1000 in the past week on these scalping trades, I
think it's time to admit that I suck at it and stop doing it! A few
bucks here and a few there accumulated so quickly.
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Until I have thoroughly developed and
backtested a strategy, I should not use it in trading.</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, my Keltner + Stochastic strategy is working well. The
only problem now is that I need to be more confident about it and let my
profit run. See this graph below of this fading trade I took after the
price shot up on the FED outcome. I knew that it's going to come back
down to fill the gap. And I knew that I shouldn't be reading my fast
time frame. Instead, if I enter on the intermediate time frame, then I
should exit on the intermediate time frame too. I knew that the bounce
would take us to the other side of the channel but I exited way too
early because I looked at my fast time frame and lost confident.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6DcshzQQkI/AAAAAAAAALk/Tb9XerDhN7A/s400/er2_dive.jpg" />][] The reason is that earlier today, I had full intention of
waiting for exit signal on the intermediate time frame, but the \$200
bounce ended up to be fake and I closed out at a little loss on that
trade. The price movement seemed the same at the time of my exit, so
that spooked me out of a potential \$700 more profit. I really shouldn't
let my loses cloud my judgement. I should just learn from it and move
on. In hindsight, the difference is that this afternoon trade had a HUGE
run prior to it and my CCI + Stochastic signal was on too, whereas the
moring losing trade only moved from mid channel and CCI signal wasn't
on. Lesson here is that <span style="font-weight:bold;">if there are
more than one BUY/SELL signal on, then the move would have higher
probability and would be bigger too</span>.</p>
<p>There's still a lot for me to learn.</p>
