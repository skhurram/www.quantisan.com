The break of the MACD and Stochastic didn't produce a strong pullback as
I have hoped. However, one thing for certain is that by the time even I
am sure it's going to fall, it would have been too late.</p>
<p>I almost entered a short position today. But held back because I am
taking enough risk already with the 4 gold contracts. If I'm to cover 2
fewer Gold shorts, then I may enter a Soybean.</p>
<p>Looking at the past year of history, it seems that Soybean corrections
precede Gold corrections. Coincidence? They seem to be controlled as a
hedge by HB&amp;B. A big drop in prices should come when these people unload
their holdings back into the equities. i.e. near the bottom of this bear
market.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5EWDvY4uyI/AAAAAAAAAIE/xYQcA2QZuo8/s400/gold.jpg" />][] Gold doesn't seem to be falling much like a correction would.
The current price is inching lower instead of falling as it should based
on the MACD and Stochastic bearish signals are disappointing. It's just
going sideways. So I'm wondering would this be just a brief
consolidation before it rises to new highs again? This uncertainty is
definitely why the price is going sideways at the moment.</p>
<p>Price is about \$885 at the moment. It would have been better if I only
had my 2 positions from above \$886. But I entered 2 more shorts at
\$880.10 in fear of missing the train. That was definitely a mistake
because it hugely increased my risk. I pretty much got in at the bottom
of the current trading range. I could have entered easily at \$886 from
the bounce when the indicators were right.</p>
<p>Last night, price of gold dropped to \$870.80 and I had over \$1000 of
paper profit. But it was short lived.</p>
<p>I won't cover on panic at the moment. I might cover the 2 extra shorts
on the next bump. Just so I can makeup for my greedy mistake and lower
my risk exposure in this uncertain situation.</p>
<p>However, after dropping for 3 days in a row, today's higher close is
expected. Next week should be more telling.</p>

expecting that Bush's speech on a stimulus package would cause a mini
rally to squeeze the shorts. So I kept entering trades on the Buy
signals. As you can see from the graph, it didn't happen. Stupid me. The
parameter is definitely too loose at the moment on the Buy signal. I
have adjusted it now and it seems to be a bit better (fewer false
positives).</p>
<p>I also shouldn't read too much into comments from Bill Cara's blog. Both
times I went against my own judgement because of reading too much of
other people's comments led to big losses. Lesson is to
<span style="font-weight:bold;">never have any expectation of the
market</span>. See what the price is doing and interpret it based on
that, and that alone. End of story.</p>
<p>In total, I think I'm down about a \$500 from my YM day trading for the
past couple of weeks. If there's any consolation, I think my system is
improving from these failures.</p>

to filter out the noise. It's also because I found that I'm not quick
trigger enough on fast times. I'm using 1200 contracts/bar at the
moment. It seems to be good. I'm also a lot more disciplined today. Not
over trading and sticking to my strategy. At the very least, my recent
loses have given me valuable experiences in day trading. Also, the floor
pivot points have been very reliable so far. The price seems to like to
bounce around these levels or settle in a range near them. Very useful
in identifying breakouts or exhaustions.</p>
<p>Here are some changes I added to my day trading screen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implemented my CCI and Stochastic strategy into a PaintBar with
    alarms</li>
<li>Added Stochastic crossing of oversold or overbought as ShowMe with
    alarms</li>
<li>Increased contracts/bar to 1200 contracts / bar for slower time
    frame</li>
<li>Added trailing stop Auto Strategy to pull the trigger for me (but
    doesn't seem to be working)</li>
<li>Decreased stop to 10 points on YM.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Never chase the price!</span> It's
    ok to miss some opportunities.</li>
<li>Only buy at the good end of the immediate trading range.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do chase the price with a trailing
    stop!</span></li>
<li>New money management technique: once price started to move in
    favoured direction, move stop to 2 points ahead of entry price to
    cover costs and then trail it with the price with some margin.</li>
</ol>
<p>#8 has been particularly useful today. I was wrong a couple of times in
my entry but was able to breakeven because of it. Such that even being
wrong wouldn't lose me money.</p>
<p></p>
Update: the market is down a lot and it seems to be oversold. I got in a
long position near the bottom (or so I thought). This could lose me \$50
if it keeps going down after this consolidation.</p>
<p>Update 2: I indeed did enter at near the bottom and my initial stopped
of 10 pts (\$50) were never touched. Then the price just shot up to the
resistance as expected. I gradually moved my stop to trail the price
move. This trade played out as I have planned. I made a quick \$120 or
so in the few minutes. I thought of reversing direction and go short
too. But I didn't want to push for luck for the day. However, the price
is now moving down as I have guessed. It might make a new low too. Oh
well.</p>
<p>Here's a graph a few minutes after my last trade.</p>
