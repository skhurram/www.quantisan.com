I took <a href="http://wrahal.blogspot.com/2008/02/trading-for-february-21-2008_21.html">Will Rahal's prediction of a
positive market for the day</a> a little too much to heart and kept
entering longs even though the market was diving. I was also thinking
that the price would bounce back to the pivot and S1 after breaking it.</p>
<p>I should have noted that the ADX was at 50 and at least wait for a
trading range if I were to enter a long. Because with such dramatic
drop, the price wouldn't turn on a dime. But even better, I could have
entered a short on the initial break below the pivot.</p>
<p>Lessons for the day:</p>
<ol>
<li>Realize that I'm wrong sooner rather than later</li>
<li>Switch from ER2 to YM after a few losing streak for a smaller
    position size</li>
<li>Don't have any pre-conceived notion of where the market will head!
    (not the first time this has cost me)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm just \$60 away from my equity limit to exit from day trading.
Although I have learned a lot, I still can't produce result
consistently. Next week will be a vital test for my near term day
trading career.</p>

I took a small profit too early instead of waiting for the big runs
afterward. It would have been a great week.</p>
<p>On Feb 14, I entered a short on the pre-market. I exited way too early
because the price kept dropping for the rest of the day and most of the
next. Although I knew the price was going to drop, I underestimated the
magnitude of it. <a href="http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2008/02/nyse-tick-using-sentiment-to-trade.html">TraderFeed wrote an article</a> about that day's market
and introduced his method of using the NYSE tick count as another
indicator.</p>
<p>I have since added it to my day trading window.</p>

went to bed. I was too tired and found that I wasn't concentrating. My
brain was definitely off already.</p>
<p>I seriously considered entering a long at about the vertical line. Then
after watching it for a few bars, the price seems to be stuck in a
trading range, so it could go either way. Since I didn't want to wait
for long because I almost fell asleep at the table, I decided to not
enter a position. It was a good decision because the price would have
went below my stop (lowest of past few bars in the trading range) before
rising just a 6 index points, and with a lot of struggle too.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day, there were a lot of choppiness and not a lot of
big swings. It would have been better to stay off the market because my
stops would have been killed.</p>
<p>Although I didn't make any profit for the day, I didn't lose any either.
So I think going to bed early last because I wasn't up for it was a wise
decision.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The 3 trade max. rule is working well tonight. I was more patient to
wait for the right moment. I almost entered my 4th trade but didn't
because I wanted to stick to my rule, at least for the first day.
Luckily, that would have been another losing trade.</p>
<p>I think I'm finally learning that it's not worth it to get into small
moves. The reward/risk ratio is usually not good. And those are usually
the emotional trades too, where I somehow convinced myself the price is
going to move that way. [<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6yCfxzQQ1I/AAAAAAAAANs/jIfly4pLVqg/s400/er2_rpt.jpg" />][]</p>

I entered a short but got stopped out on a quick bump. Then I
immediately got back in once I see the stochastic is doing down and the
price is topping on the fast time period.</p>
<p>This turned out to be a good decision as I rode it down 5 points. I
thought the drop could reach the lower Keltner at first. But from
watching the action, the move seemed to be testing the 50 EMA and
failing to punch through. In addition, I expected there wouldn't be much
volatiliy today because the last 2 sessions had large swings and there
didn't much going on in the fundamental side today (no news). So I
exited while I could. That wasn't the bottom but was close enough
because after a bit of struggle in a tight range, the price did bounce
back up to the day's high. I should have waited a bit more when the
signs were more clear. I think I was just lucky that I exited near the
bottom. It could have easily been a consolidation and then tanked
further.</p>
<p>The proper exit point is when on the fast time period, the price stayed
in a zone for longer than the previous resistance level and the
intermediate time frame showed the hammer formation. Remember, if I
enter on a time frame, use the same time frame for exit. It would have
been a less profitable trade in this case, but the price could have went
further.</p>

two weeks in Canada. I could blame it on the fact that I'm not used to
trading at night and that I was very tired also because of jet lag.
However, I shouldn't have traded at all if I knew that I wasn't in good
condition.</p>
<p>Perhaps the thinking that caused me to trade so many times is that I
didn't want to miss any opportunities. I move in too fast before the
signals are mature. Thus, one thing I need to do is don't guess where
the market is moving. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Let the signals
mature and the price to move a bit first before entering; I don't have
to get in and out at exactly the top and bottom of a swing</span>.</p>
<p>For the moment, I am imposing a 3 trades maximum rule to restrain myself
until I'm producing better results and am more disciplined.</p>
