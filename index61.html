            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Here's yet another <strong>paper trade</strong> order from my new trading strategy.
The short entry stop is set at \$35.95 for -30 shares (just over \$1k
total). Stop is at \$37.79, the recent high (Figure 1). Target is
\$29.5, a support level just above the trendlines intersect about \$27.5
(Figure 2).</p>
<p>Assuming a perfect entry at \$35.95, the risk is \$1.84. The reward is
\$6.95. Thus, the risk/reward is 3.77, which is above a 3-fold
risk/reward as I prefer.</p>
<p>For this trade, I've also considered the sector strength as a whole.
From Figure 3, we see that XLE is approaching a congestion zone about
\$48 - \$50. So there is an upside resistance to the Energy sector.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just closed my USO long position. I bought back the [puts that I wrote
for \$1.75 about a month ago][]. This represents a realized profit of
\$280 - \$15 for commission. I actually wanted to get out of this
position last Friday when USO tested \$30. But <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/buy-stop-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-65/">my stop was never
triggered</a> so I held on to the options through the weekend, thinking
I'd benefit from the time decay anyway.</p>
<p>Today, USO reached \$30.50 with some relatively low volume. \$30.50 also
mark the top of a recent up channel (Figure 2). With my limited profit
potential at this point, I'm inclined to take my profit than risk a
retracement.</p>
<p>This trade has certainly been a roller coaster ride. The <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/review-of-positions-srs-and-uso/">price of USO
didn't move up as planned</a>. It actually took a dive but picked itself
up back to around my entry price on a slow up move. In the end, it was
the time decay of the options that helped to make this supposedly losing
trade into a winning one.</p>
<p>This is another example to favour writing puts instead of buying shares
in this volatile market condition.</p>
<p>On another note, I'll look into USL instead of USO in the future for any
Oil trade. The April roll over contango took a stab at the USO price
last month. I was lucky for the short put strategy saving me.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Volume continues to be low this week. The negative divergence as shown
in Figure 1 (right) is staring everyone in the face now. However, we're
still within an uptrend channel (Figure 2). And if we were to break up
from here on good volume, we'd be forming an inverse head and shoulder.
Thus, it's anyone game within this trading range around 840 - 880.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smbtraining.com/blog/?p=556">SMB Capital has a good review of the week</a>.</p>
<p><strong>GICS Sectors Review</strong></p>
<p>From the 6-months chart, we see that Technology (XLK), Telecom (IYZ),
and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are back to their previous level 6
months ago. The resistance is clear as the sectors are now jammed
together around that 0% level on the 6-months chart.</p>
<p>From the 1-month chart, we see that the bottom 3 sectors (XLE, IYZ, XLU)
ran up in the last week to overtake Healthcare (XLV).</p>
<p>For the 5-day chart, we see an interesting picture. The recent bear
rally leader, Financials (XLF), has ended the week at the bottom of the
pack and looked weak for the entire week actually. Energy (XLE) looked
strong all week and the Telecom (IYZ) made a friday run up to catch up
to it too.</p>
<p>Comparing this to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-24-2009/">last week's market review</a>, this is clearly a money
flow rotation between sectors in progress as the previous leader became
the bottom fish and the mediocre ones became the leader. This is a sign
that we may be breaking out of our trading range soon as the big money
are prepping their front row seats.</p>

other words, I've placed an exit stop for my long USO position.</p>
<p>USO tested the recent up channel on low volume today. Furthermore, NY
Crude futures (QM) at \$53+ is nearing a long term resistance of \$55.
So there's not much upside left in this. Thus, I've placed an exit stop
just below an intraday support to take some profit. I'm just trying not
to be greedy here. I'll write a more thorough analysis if this stop gets
triggered today.</p>

<p>I should have noticed from the 200 week MA that SCSC has been pretty
strong lately. I should have only entered when the long term trend is in

<p>Anyway, after running through a few more charts, it seems that my stock
filter is giving a contrarian indication. There's still a lot of work to
do to develop this new system.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>In my <a href="/about/">About page</a>, I summarized my trading history. You'll no doubt
see that between now and then, I admitted that I plundered my trading
account twice. Needless to say, that was a memorable period in my life.
The easy money from my lucky early years bit back hard and were taken
away within months. I'm surprised at myself why I'm even back at this
game now. There's a reason why I'm bringing this up. No, I am not broke
again. I only commit what I can lose in trading now. Still, I am aware
that I need to do a lot better in terms of risk management and
discipline before I can become a decent trader. But I digressed. You
see, like a dead pirate clinging on to his treasure, I've never let go
of those shares from that trade that broke me. As of this writing, I
still have a sizable shares of EMFP that I purchased from 2006 for
average of $1.23. For the record, here are my 3 entries:</p>
<ol>
<li>November 9, 2006 for 3500 shares at $0.77</li>
<li>November 30, 2006 for 9512 shares at $0.56</li>
<li>December 31, 2006 for 34695 shares at $1.46</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, comparing the dates and entry prices with the chart of Figure
1, it seems that my record is wrong because the trading prices on those
dates are way off. I will need to dig up some paper and check my record.
Anyway, my average price is correct at $1.23. For the first few months
of the share price dive, I was so naive that I thought the stock was
<em>cheap</em>. Then once reality sets in, I was just in shock that I didn't do
anything about it. By then, it was too late to savage anything
worthwhile.</p>
<p>As you can see from Figure 1, the move from $2.00 to $0.20
took 1 year. Since then, I just wrote this position off in my mind and
left the shares to collect dust. As you can see, EMFP even dipped to
$0.01 last year. My intention is to unload it in a later year when I
need a tax break. However, this week, EMFP moved from $0.07 to $0.35
and closed at $0.20.</p>
<p>You see, EMFP, or Emergency Filtration Products
Inc., markets a product called NanoMask that has been independently
tested to be effective against influenza and other viruses as a face
mask. With the recent talk of a global pandemic because of the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-04-28-swine-flu_N.htm">swine flu scare</a>, it's clear to see why there's renewed interest in EMFP.</p>
<p>In fact, the volume has spiked to about 2 million yesterday and almost 1
million shares today. There were days and weeks with no share traded at
all for EMFP in the past year. I am not so naive anymore to think EMFP
may climb back to its former glory. However, I hope EMFP can stir up
some more interest and trading volume, just so I can finish the fight
once and for all and close this embarassing trade in my log book. So,
I'd like to start this trade log and put EMFP back on my radar. I should
have unloaded a chunk of my holding yesterday when EMFP stayed around
$0.25. </p>
<p>However, I thought that I've waited this long, I might as well
let this flu panic play out and give EMFP more time to do something.
This is the first of my mistake, greed. This could very well cost me my
last chance to ditch this. My reason for holding is that we've hit the
200 day MA at $0.35 yesterday (Figure 2), so a bounce back was
expected.</p>
<p>Then today, EMFP held above the $0.13 support (low was
$0.14) on the retracement. With the still relatively low volume, this
stock is swinging like a wild bull. So large trading ranges is a given.
There are definitely a lot of resistance at $0.30. Yet, we have
established an up trend since the bounce from $0.01. This recent gap up
at huge volume would look good if EMFP can break above this up trend
with this momentum. Otherwise, breaking below $0.13 support would lead
this back to the coffin. Anyway, it's too early to tell. I usually say
watch the price levels at this point, however, in this case, I say that
it's more important to watch the volume. A sustained level of volume in
EMFP means there's finally some interest. And since we're pretty much at
rock bottom for the price, volume would lead to higher prices.</p>
