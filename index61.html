            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Here's finally a real order after a string of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trades</a>. Remember
USO? I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-35/">was long in USO</a> not too long ago. Well, the same channel that
told me to exit my long position is looking toppy.</p>
<p>One thing I learned from my USO trade is that this ETF is a money losing
game. [The roll over every month of contracts put a severe strain on USO
share price][]. And yesterday was the last day of this month's rollover.
At around 1:30pm yesterday, there were some significant volume with
dumping of USO shares at \$32. This is the first sign of distribution of
USO shares.</p>
<p>Then today, I see the same thing happening at the intraday resistance.
Sudden spike in volumes within seconds at the resistance of \$32.42.
This is a sign that a big player is dumping shares.</p>
<p>However, this is mere a conjecture on my part. This could also be a way
for some big players to rake in more shares. So don't rely on this too
much.</p>
<p>Looking at the bigger pictures though, I see weaknesses in the weekly
and daily charts too. Also, the break to the top of the up channel
(Figure 3) was only greeted by low volumes. So it's unlikely that we
will break further up from here.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a small play with a tight stop and high probability
(contango is on my side this time around) of success, that is if I don't
get stopped out first.</p>
<p>Short entry stop: \$32.21, just below some intraday congestion and
support from last week.</p>
<p>Exit stop: \$32.49, intraday top so far.</p>
<p>Target: \$29.50. 50% Fib level from this rally and near bottom of a huge
congestion zone in the recent months.</p>
<p>Reward / Risk = 2.71 / 0.28 = 9.7 > 3.0</p>
<p>Update: USO dipped below \$32 in the pre-market on Monday. But I'll pass
because I'm very low on available cash in my trading account. I need to
limit my risk exposure even though I still think this is a great
opportunity. I'll put this one in a <strong>paper trade</strong> just to see how it
goes. Order is set for an entry short stop at \$31.99 to be submitted at
3:30pm today.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Veolia Environment (VE) has all the right setup for a short according to
my experimental trading strategy (version 1.1). Here's a log for a
<strong>paper trade</strong> order.</p>
<p>My logic for this short.</p>
<p>​1. We are in a bear market.</p>
<p>​2. Utilities (XLU) at \$26.86 is hitting the bottom of its congestion
zone from \$28-\$30 but broke a downtrend resistance on low volume
(Figure 1).</p>
<p>​3. The VE weekly looks good for short (Figure 2).</p>
<p>​4. The VE daily looks very good for short (see stochastic Figure 3).</p>
<p>​5. VE just tested a long term declining trendline from March 2008
(Figure 4).</p>
<p>Short entry stop: \$27.85, below current upward channel (Figure 4) and
hourly support from last week (Figure 3)</p>
<p>Exit stop: \$29.25, above hourly resistance (Figure 3)</p>
<p>Target \$25.0, 50% Fibonacci retracement, middle of previous congestion
zone, and nice number.</p>
<p>Reward/risk = 4.25/1.4 = 3.035 > 3.0</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Here's another <strong>paper trade</strong>. I've been trying this new strategy a
couple of times now, although it has generated 2 entry orders, none were
triggered so far (the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-50-scsc-2352/">SCSC trade</a> was from version 1, I'm at version
1.1 now). This is mostly because I've been entering shorts but the
market has been chugging upward like a relentless train. It's not that
I'm not keeping an open mind, but at this point, I haven't been able to
spot a good long trade.</p>
<p>Here are my logic for this play.</p>
<p>​1. We are still in a long term bear market. Although we're definitely
in an intermediate up trend at the moment.</p>
<p>​2. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) is a real estate play. Everyone knows
real estate stocks are in a severe bear trend. That's inline with the
direction of this play.</p>
<p>​3. VNO is testing the lower boundary of a congestion zone between
\$50-\$60.</p>
<p>​4. VNO's weekly indicators look bearish. And its daily ones look way
overbought.</p>
<p>​5. I am entering below its current up channel and below a support at
\$49.76.</p>
<p>​6. Reward/Risk of 7.07/1.90 = 3.72</p>
<p>Points 1-5 setup a favourable probability of this trade. Point 6 is the
reward/risk.</p>
<p>Entry stop: \$49.70</p>
<p>Exit stop: \$51.60</p>
<p>Target: \$42.63</p>
<p>The target I'm setting is a long term support from December of 2008. It
is also above the 25% intermediate term upward channel established from
March 2009, the bounce from its low. And it is at the 50% Fibonacci
retracement level from its recent run.</p>
<p>Update: My entry was triggered at 9:34 a.m. I have 25 shares of VNO
shorted at \$49.70 on paper now.</p>
<p>Update2: VNO almost touched \$52 on Friday May 8, so my position was
stopped out. I will probably put on another trade as VNO came back down
to below \$50 on Monday today.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Here's yet another <strong>paper trade</strong> order from my new trading strategy.
The short entry stop is set at \$35.95 for -30 shares (just over \$1k
total). Stop is at \$37.79, the recent high (Figure 1). Target is
\$29.5, a support level just above the trendlines intersect about \$27.5
(Figure 2).</p>
<p>Assuming a perfect entry at \$35.95, the risk is \$1.84. The reward is
\$6.95. Thus, the risk/reward is 3.77, which is above a 3-fold
risk/reward as I prefer.</p>
<p>For this trade, I've also considered the sector strength as a whole.
From Figure 3, we see that XLE is approaching a congestion zone about
\$48 - \$50. So there is an upside resistance to the Energy sector.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just closed my USO long position. I bought back the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-175/">puts that I wrote
for \$1.75 about a month ago</a>. This represents a realized profit of
\$280 - \$15 for commission. I actually wanted to get out of this
position last Friday when USO tested \$30. But <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/buy-stop-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-65/">my stop was never
triggered</a> so I held on to the options through the weekend, thinking
I'd benefit from the time decay anyway.</p>
<p>Today, USO reached \$30.50 with some relatively low volume. \$30.50 also
mark the top of a recent up channel (Figure 2). With my limited profit
potential at this point, I'm inclined to take my profit than risk a
retracement.</p>
<p>This trade has certainly been a roller coaster ride. The <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/review-of-positions-srs-and-uso/">price of USO
didn't move up as planned</a>. It actually took a dive but picked itself
up back to around my entry price on a slow up move. In the end, it was
the time decay of the options that helped to make this supposedly losing
trade into a winning one.</p>
<p>This is another example to favour writing puts instead of buying shares
in this volatile market condition.</p>
<p>On another note, I'll look into USL instead of USO in the future for any
Oil trade. The April roll over contango took a stab at the USO price
last month. I was lucky for the short put strategy saving me.</p>

in Figure 1 (right) is staring everyone in the face now. However, we're
still within an uptrend channel (Figure 2). And if we were to break up
from here on good volume, we'd be forming an inverse head and shoulder.
Thus, it's anyone game within this trading range around 840 - 880.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smbtraining.com/blog/?p=556">SMB Capital has a good review of the week</a>.</p>
<p><strong>GICS Sectors Review</strong></p>
<p>From the 6-months chart, we see that Technology (XLK), Telecom (IYZ),
and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are back to their previous level 6
months ago. The resistance is clear as the sectors are now jammed
together around that 0% level on the 6-months chart.</p>
<p>From the 1-month chart, we see that the bottom 3 sectors (XLE, IYZ, XLU)
ran up in the last week to overtake Healthcare (XLV).</p>
<p>For the 5-day chart, we see an interesting picture. The recent bear
rally leader, Financials (XLF), has ended the week at the bottom of the
pack and looked weak for the entire week actually. Energy (XLE) looked
strong all week and the Telecom (IYZ) made a friday run up to catch up
to it too.</p>
<p>Comparing this to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-24-2009/">last week's market review</a>, this is clearly a money
flow rotation between sectors in progress as the previous leader became
the bottom fish and the mediocre ones became the leader. This is a sign
that we may be breaking out of our trading range soon as the big money
are prepping their front row seats.</p>
