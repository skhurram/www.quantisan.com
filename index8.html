            <div class="article-content"> <p>My wife is pursuing graduate study at Oxford. So I'm taking this rare
opportunity to quit my day job and concentrate on developing trading
systems full time. I am also doing some consulting to keep in touch with
civilization. I have just one project at the moment building a customer
relation system for a friend's financial services startup.</p>
<p>Now for some self-promotion. I specialise in building software systems
for information discovery, and of course, trading systems too. If you
know of any business that can make use of an information discovery
system for better customer relation, inventory management, etc, then
please forward <a href="mailto:paul@quantisan.com">email</a>.</p>
<p>That's it for the public service announcement. I'll be off to my first
meetup this Sunday to hack on an open source statistical computing
platform. I can't wait to meet some very smart people!</p> </div>

Hadoop on CentOS 5 working. I'm more of an Ubuntu guy, so CentOS is a

exception about the java heap space. I couldn't find a solution online
so I just bumped up the memory on the virtual machine and it solved the
problem. In any case, I managed to run <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module3.html#vm-jobs">the pi calculation example</a> on

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Testing is arguably the single most important aspect of trading system
development. You can't tell how well an idea works unless you test it
out. [Testing can also help you identify weaknesses or strengths in your
model][]. The downside to testing is that it takes time to churn through
those gigabytes of data. Backtesting is inherently a linear process. You
feed in your tick data into your algorithm and expect some actions. You
can't really make use of fork/join to let other threads steal from the
process queue as the later process depends on results from the earlier
calculations. However, often times than not, you're interested in
testing many variations of a strategy. This is where MapReduce comes
into play. MapReduce is a Google software framework. It is inspired by
the map and reduce functions ubiquitous in functional programming. They
are as common as for-loops in the Java world. The <em>map</em> function
partitions an input into smaller problems and run them concurrently,
e.g. each of the strategy's variant is executed on a node. The <em>reduce</em>
function takes the results from all the nodes and aggregate them to get
an output, e.g. back-test results from each strategy. Having used
functional programming for some time now, using map/reduce is very
natural for me. Where my knowledge falls short is in implementing a
distributed infrastructure for running these map and reduce with massive
scaling beyond my own multi-core computer. It just so happens that
Amazon AWS has a hosted Hadoop PaaS. Where Hadoop is the Apache's
framework for MapReduce. Hardware, check. Framework, check. This will be
the ~~first~~ second system that I'll be working on in my goal to build
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/towards-a-broker-agnostic-trading-system/">a complete trading R&amp;D platform</a>. Expect some technical discussions
in the coming months as I work my way through. Now, where should I
start...</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The first generation of my trading system uses a broker's proprietary
script on that same broker's platform. The second generation of my
trading system uses a generic programming language on another broker's
platform. I am now working on the third generation of my trading system.
It is language-agnostic, platform-agnostic, and broker-agnostic. Why?
Because designing trading systems is as much about creativity as the
science. An artist would not limit themselves to a defined toolset. I
want to be free to use whatever tools are necessary to get the job done
efficiently and being able to try new things as technologies evolve.
Having a broker-agnostic system frees me from being locked into any
particular broker. Conversely, I could use one system to gather data and
trade from multiple brokers for the best execution prices. Yes, this is
over-engineering for a small entity like myself. But heck, this is
something that I enjoy building. So why not?</p> </div>
