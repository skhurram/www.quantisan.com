retracement on Stochastic crossing signal line IF it's not too far down.
Maybe Stochastic between 85 and 50 for long.</p>
<p>This could complement the Keltner channel, Stochastic, CCI strategy
because it would have exited on any retracement.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy</a> to catch a turn in trend using
Stochastic, Commodity Channel Index (CCI), and Keltner Channel. Here's
the concept. Enter position on concurrent signals from the following
indicators. CCI (which marks a turn), Stochastic (in corresponding
overbought or oversold zone for confirmation), and Keltner channel
(relative position of the current price) signals. To avoid hunting for
tops or bottoms in a strong move, do not enter if the current trend is
obviously opposite of the entry position. That can probably be filtered
by a 2-ema technique, MACD, or by analyzing a higher time frame. Below
are two example charts with all the indicators used illustrated along
with the entry signals. Blue dots for long entry, red for short. If you

<ol>
<li>I do have an over-trading tendency.</li>
<li>My strategy sucks!</li>

<p>Actually, the strategy isn't that bad, just that it's too ambiguous. I
have now added ADX and Keltner channel for further confirmations. More
on this in my next post.</p>

My strategy for Dow should work on the ER2 too. Moreover, ER2 seems to
be more straightforward and easier to trade. It really does seem like a
nice market to trade. I'll continue to keep an eye on it.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5fFeBzQQTI/AAAAAAAAAJE/cPw6Txz0lV4/s400/ymday.jpg" />][] Dow opened about 200 points lower today, the news were saying
it'd be another down day. But most traders know better. We might be at a
short term bottom at the moment because of the Fed intervention. By
about noon, the market bottomed out to a new low and started to pick up.
The rally went into full gear at almost exactly 3pm (ET) on a rally with
little breathing room for short covering. This was quite expected and
the signals were clear after the noon bottom.</p>
<p>However, this is where I was caught. My first 2 hours of trading were
great. I was up over \$200. Then in the mid-day, even when I was right
about the direction of the market, I ended up down about \$350 because
of all the choppy actions. In addition, I should be more confident of my
belief in a rally because of the obvious uptrend. Yet, the market acted
as if it's going to plunge.</p>
<p>As you can see from the graph above, I got into many trades in the
middle of the day. But not all of them were losing trades. I saw that
the market was in a trading range and profitted from fading the
breakouts. That made me a bit of money, but a few bad trades got me into
the negative.</p>
<p>I wasn't too happy to see my account under \$15,000 in the afternoon.
However, one thing I did well was regain my composure and got back into
the game with a clear mind. I had put my lost behind and only strived to
minimize risk in my later trades.</p>
<p>Fortunately, near the end of the day, a real rally broke out as
expected. I didn't get excited and chased the price. Instead, I waited
my opportunity on a retracement and got into a long. That one last trade
made back all my loses. Even though my short term entry and exit were ok
on this trade. I should have entered another long position on the 2nd
retracement for the 2nd longer leg in the rally to double up on my long
position. I could have made at least another \$1000 or so if I had done
that.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">So three lessons from today</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't waste my time on low reward trade. Only enter trades if I
    expect the reward to be a few times (at least 3) more than my stop.</li>
<li>Be careful in the mid-day when only the pros are swimming. Better
    yet, only trade in first 2 and last 1 hours.</li>
<li>When I am right, raise the stake in the pot! i.e. average up!</li>
</ol>

dollar. Recession is off and inflation is back in town. So gold is on
the run again. (i.e. recession lower demand of gold, inflation raises
value) I immediately took action and closed all my short positions at
\$869.50</p>
<p>Gold price went rocketed today and closed at \$890.60 So now my gold run
is off, even worst, I missed a big opportunity.</p>
<p>When I was certain that gold price would rise, I correctly covered my
short. However, I should have changed side and WENT LONG on it! I still
need to develop this <span style="font-weight:bold;">flip flopping
mentality</span> if I were to improve on my trading. I missed out only
an easy \$20 jump on Gold today because I didn't go long after closing
the short even though I knew for certain the price would increase.</p>
<p>Lesson of the day: <span style="font-weight:bold;">A bad short is a good
long.</span></p>
