lost money today.</p>
<p>Two reasons really:</p>
<ol>
<li>my stops are too tight</li>
<li>YM is too choppy</li>
</ol>
<p>I have cut down on erraneous trades but the false positives on the long
side today caught me many times. I don't think I'll be trading the Dow
from now on. Furthermore, the more I day trade, the more I want to
develop a trading system for mechanical trading. Day trading is giving
me experience and ideas for new strategies. I will get back on
programming soon.</p>
<p></p>
I have enabled CME data and will try the ER2 next week. I decided to
move to ER2 like I've always planned on. The only reason I haven't done
so earlier is that the stake is a lot higher there. But if I can trade
better there, then it'll be better than letting YM eat up a bit here and
a bit there even though it's \$5/pt. On the same day, here's the graph
for ER2. Notice that it's much nicer and fewer false signals, aka MM
traps.</p>

retracement on Stochastic crossing signal line IF it's not too far down.
Maybe Stochastic between 85 and 50 for long.</p>
<p>This could complement the Keltner channel, Stochastic, CCI strategy
because it would have exited on any retracement.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy</a> to catch a turn in trend using
Stochastic, Commodity Channel Index (CCI), and Keltner Channel. Here's
the concept. Enter position on concurrent signals from the following
indicators. CCI (which marks a turn), Stochastic (in corresponding
overbought or oversold zone for confirmation), and Keltner channel
(relative position of the current price) signals. To avoid hunting for
tops or bottoms in a strong move, do not enter if the current trend is
obviously opposite of the entry position. That can probably be filtered
by a 2-ema technique, MACD, or by analyzing a higher time frame. Below
are two example charts with all the indicators used illustrated along
with the entry signals. Blue dots for long entry, red for short. If you

<li>My strategy sucks!</li>

<p>Actually, the strategy isn't that bad, just that it's too ambiguous. I
have now added ADX and Keltner channel for further confirmations. More

My strategy for Dow should work on the ER2 too. Moreover, ER2 seems to
be more straightforward and easier to trade. It really does seem like a
nice market to trade. I'll continue to keep an eye on it.</p>

it'd be another down day. But most traders know better. We might be at a
short term bottom at the moment because of the Fed intervention. By
about noon, the market bottomed out to a new low and started to pick up.
The rally went into full gear at almost exactly 3pm (ET) on a rally with
little breathing room for short covering. This was quite expected and
the signals were clear after the noon bottom.</p>
<p>However, this is where I was caught. My first 2 hours of trading were
great. I was up over \$200. Then in the mid-day, even when I was right
about the direction of the market, I ended up down about \$350 because
of all the choppy actions. In addition, I should be more confident of my
belief in a rally because of the obvious uptrend. Yet, the market acted
as if it's going to plunge.</p>
<p>As you can see from the graph above, I got into many trades in the
middle of the day. But not all of them were losing trades. I saw that
the market was in a trading range and profitted from fading the
breakouts. That made me a bit of money, but a few bad trades got me into
the negative.</p>
<p>I wasn't too happy to see my account under \$15,000 in the afternoon.
However, one thing I did well was regain my composure and got back into
the game with a clear mind. I had put my lost behind and only strived to
minimize risk in my later trades.</p>
<p>Fortunately, near the end of the day, a real rally broke out as
expected. I didn't get excited and chased the price. Instead, I waited
my opportunity on a retracement and got into a long. That one last trade
made back all my loses. Even though my short term entry and exit were ok
on this trade. I should have entered another long position on the 2nd
retracement for the 2nd longer leg in the rally to double up on my long
position. I could have made at least another \$1000 or so if I had done
that.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">So three lessons from today</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't waste my time on low reward trade. Only enter trades if I
    expect the reward to be a few times (at least 3) more than my stop.</li>
<li>Be careful in the mid-day when only the pros are swimming. Better
    yet, only trade in first 2 and last 1 hours.</li>
<li>When I am right, raise the stake in the pot! i.e. average up!</li>
</ol>
