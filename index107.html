            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've nearly pulled the trigger today on adding some shorts. Then I
decided against it because there's no action in the market and no good
confirmation. My 50% long, 25% short, and 25% cash distribution seems
alright for now. But Figure 1 below leads me to want to add more to the
short side.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 1, the market is still clearly in a downtrend.
Moreover, we are at the top end of the channel. So shorting at this
point has a good risk/reward ratio.</p>

<p>In particular, Goldman Sachs in Figure 2 seems like a decent play.</p>

<p>But as I was saying, I'd rather wait for GS to break the triangle first
before making a move. With the current market, it's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/auto-bailout-shakeout-december-13-2008/">better to be late
than early</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I entered a short to hedge my longs as planned. I have been trying SKF a
few times previously but keep getting stopped out. So I'm giving a shot
at DUG this time around. Today S&amp;P broke down to the bottom of my up
channel again. We could very well bounce back, but I needed to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/auto-bailout-shakeout-december-13-2008/">hedge my
position as planned</a>.</p>

<p>Upside: Positive divergence on the daily. Strong support at \$30.
Unfilled gap above \$34.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$31</p>
<p>Downside: Still in downtrend. EMA shows downtrend gaining momentum. Oil
broke recent downtrend too.</p>
<p>Support: \$30</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is a short hedge to safeguard my longs if the market
do break down from here. As I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/auto-bailout-shakeout-december-13-2008/">noted before</a>, this is a distinct possibility I need to account for. I intend
to hold this for several weeks.</p>
<p>Target: At least \$34.</p>
<p>Stop: Observe \$25-\$26 level.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>To bail. Not to bail. To bail. Not to bail. Friday's market gapped down
big time on news the bailout failed to pass the senate on Thursday
night. Then just hours later, rumours were surfacing about the White
House stepping in with the TARP money. As of Saturday, FP headline reads
White House holds off on auto bailout.</p>
<p>Since I'm no economist, I am not going to discuss about the auto bailout
here. What matters to me is the market. As I was saying, the market
gapped down Friday morning and even touched 851 in the first few
minutes. However, it hacked its way back up to close positive at 879.73.</p>
<p>We managed to hold this critical 850 support level as I noted in
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/post-market-analysis-december-11-2008/">Thursday's post-market analysis</a>. However, I wouldn't want to add to
the longs at this point because both of my uptrend channels have been
broken. I feel that at this point, it is safer to watch and be more late
into a trend than usual.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to see the S&amp;P 500's behaviour around 860 or
900 (Figure 2), which ever comes first, before adding to my existing
positions.</p>

<p>On a more personal note, my stops for DRYS and SKF were triggered on
Friday.</p>
<p>On December 12, 2008 8:30:32 AM, my -\$1.0 trailing stop for DRYS were
triggered (stop at \$7.90) and my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-200-drys-533/">last 100 shares</a> were sold for a
basement price of \$7.34. I have definitely been a victim by the market
makers gunning for stops. As DRYS pushed higher throughout the day and
closed at \$9.37 on Friday.</p>
<p>As I'm actually away on a trip for these few weeks, I don't think I'll
re-enter DRYS until it clears the resistance at \$12. I simply cannot
watch it as close as I would like.</p>
<p>In any case, I already unloaded half my position <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-drys-111103/">previously at
\$11.11</a>. So although I feel I've been ripped off with my stop, I
believe this is overall still a good trade because I unloaded on
strength and have set a reasonable (using my channel) stop just in case
it turns back down on me while I'm away.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_973" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>My Ultrashort Financials (SKF) stop was triggered on Friday too. This
one I am a little dumbfounded. I have set my trailing stop at -\$17 on
the mark for SKF. The stop price of \$124 was triggered and my 7 shares
were sold for \$124.09. Having <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-7-skf-12883/">bought at \$128.83 the previous day</a>,
this is a small loss.</p>
<p>Notice that giant opening spike in the chart below? This is yet another
example of the market makers gunning for the stops. I believe I should
have set a hard stop instead for this one since I'm using it as a hedge.</p>

<p>This is still a trader's market. Since I'm away oversea, I can't manage
my account as effective as I would have liked. Setting the trailing
stops was a safety measure. Although they worked against me this time, I
still think it was a good decision given my circumstances.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am at 50% longs now with no hedge (not good). My other 50% is
in cash. My primary short term goal now is to seek out a good short
entry to hedge my longs. I don't think I have the guts to add anymore
longs until I see more strength in this rally.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I intended to take on a short to hedge my position after I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-drys-111103/">unloaded my
DRYS shares yesterday</a>. The main reason is that I'll be away for a
couple of weeks and will have limited access to the market. So it's only
prudent to hedge my long positions in this volatile market.</p>
<p>The 115 level was an obvious resistance yesterday for the Ultrashort
Financials (SKF). I thought of entering at about the 110 back then, but
resisted the temptation to catch a bottom and waited until it can break
through 115. We didn't stay below 115 for long today. And as you can
see, I'm in at 129.</p>

<p>Upside: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/post-market-analysis-december-11-2008/">Market is still in a downtrend</a>. SKF broke above 115
resistance level. High volume test of \$130 resistance (\$129 is 200 day
MA) at end-of-day today. CO and Stochastic are both bullish on the
daily.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$130.</p>
<p>Downside: Still within downtrend channel. Heavy resistance at 130 level.</p>
<p>Support: \$115.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This doesn't look like a good trade. That's why I'm only
entering a small position as a hedge for my longs. Frankly, I hope this
doesn't work out. Since I'll be away, I have set a loose trailing stop.</p> </div>
