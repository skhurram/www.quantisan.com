            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm down \$1000 in 2 days from day trading ER2. Take a look at these
graphs and it's obvious the reason is that I've over-traded.</p>

two weeks in Canada. I could blame it on the fact that I'm not used to
trading at night and that I was very tired also because of jet lag.
However, I shouldn't have traded at all if I knew that I wasn't in good
condition.</p>
<p>Perhaps the thinking that caused me to trade so many times is that I
didn't want to miss any opportunities. I move in too fast before the
signals are mature. Thus, one thing I need to do is don't guess where
the market is moving. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Let the signals
mature and the price to move a bit first before entering; I don't have
to get in and out at exactly the top and bottom of a swing</span>.</p>
<p>For the moment, I am imposing a 3 trades maximum rule to restrain myself
until I'm producing better results and am more disciplined.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6I-lhzQQtI/AAAAAAAAAMs/e3JJNFik3BA/s400/er2_trade.jpg" />][]I'm starting a trade of the day series in addition to my daily
day trading report. This is to highlight a particular good or bad trade
of the day where I think it's worth documenting.</p>
<p>In this trade, both my CCI and Kelterner indicated a sell. So a double
confirmation. So I waited for an entry by looking at my fast time frame.
On the fast time frame, the price has been in Stochastic overbought zone
for like 20 bars. Then a double top came outside of Keltner at price
\$699.60, which is just below the \$700 resistance. So I entered a short
near the top, which made a triple top and placed a stop just above
\$700.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, it broke through \$700. Not good. It seemed to me
like the MM are eating up the stops. So I moved my stop up above \$701.
I was quite certain that the price is going down...</p>
<p>After just passing \$701, the price started to go down as expected.
However, it was more like drifting down and coiling up rather than a
fast breakdown. The stochastic was choppy too. So I wasn't so sure
anymore and decided it's better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>I exited my position at \$699.50 (local low wa \$698.60) when the
Stochastic was going out of the oversold zone. Soon afterward, the price
continued on its run for the day. I was very fortunate to have at least
made back the comissions.</p>
<p>Lessons from this trade:</p>
<ol>
<li>Placing stops just above weak support/resistance could easily get
    taken out.</li>
<li>If the price
    <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">hasn't
    moved</span> as intended, then re-evaluate the position and cut
    loses if things don't look good. There's always another chance.</li>
</ol>

had a good day today and covered my losses from yesterday. Good days
always seem to come after a bad day. I think it's probably because I'm
more calm after a losing day. So now, I just need to maintain my
composure even if I'm up.</p>
<p>MBIA had a conference call today and told everyone everything's still
good even though they are reporting a \$2.3bln loss last quarter! Go
figure! Someone at BillCara is suggesting that the fund managers are
proping the market because it's the last day of the month. Just so they
can have a positive January.</p>
<p>I traded the pre-market signal as intended and it paid off. The gap
closed as expected but I <span style="font-weight:bold;">exited too
early</span> again. If only I held longer, my profits would have been in
the 4 figures today.</p>
<p>I did well today, entering trades only when the risk/reward ratio is
deemed worthwhile. In addition, I am making use of resistance and
support levels. I think this helped a lot.</p>
<p>However, I think I need to be quicker on my decision. I found that many
times, I was still pondering should I enter and then the price have
moved already. On the other hand, my exit trigger is a bit too fast
because I'm still not letting my profit run. Thus, I think I need to
automate some of my decision making process (like adding some ShowMe's)
rather than just eyeballing my indicators. One idea I'm having is tune
my fast time period with an appropriate ShowMe. This should be something
simple. I am thinking of implementing a ShowMe for local high/low with
stochastic divergence as setup.</p>

for later analysis.</p>
<div id="c43346">
</p>
Stu: If I may..dont guess the market direction.!!

Just trade with the trend between support and resistance zones. Let the
market tell you direction...dont guess...trade with a 'no mind' (thats
from the last samurai movie):).

i.e.e dont think too much, think when you are doing your homework at
night or pre-market, not during trading.

Try This. On your monitor...put up 3 charts. 1) \$SPX 2) Breadth chart
like \$ NYAD or \$NYSE advancing issues, add a 10period moving ave on a
3 or 5 min chart. 3) The chart of what you are trading, I guess the XLF.

Before market moving events. take the \$SPX chart ..start with the
weekly time frame . Draw all key resistance and support zones. the
nearest resistance zone today was around \$spx 1385ish.

Go to your dailies..nearest resistance..1380ish, go to a 5 day 5 minute
chart, and draw a line connecting the two most prominent pivot lows.
Hopefully the line extends as you trade, dont know your platform. That
tells you resistance 1380ish, support 1350ish. No worries with market
direction, or size of rate cut.

Now you know 2 potential reversal points. now trade within it by
following the trend of the rbeadth chart.if the breadth is trading above
the 10moving average..go long. if below go short.

if the 10 moving average is flat on the breadth chart..stay out..its
likely to be a congestion zone.low reward to risk.

FOMC announces...irrelevant..market direction matters ..follow your
market breadth chart. The first reaction..look at your breadth chart
dont look at prices. look at MARKET DIRECTION.

3 steps FOMC announcement..1)knee-jerk..2)counter knee jerk...then
3)trade direction . market trends up and reverses at \$SPX 1380
ish.which coincides with XLF reversal ( there is also a RSI bearish
divergence, AND a long red bar).sell your UYG, go long SKF.... 2 large
directional moves.

Now you have your lines markng \$SPX resistance, the trendline from the
last two lows, RSI bearish divergence on XLF and a red candlestick at
resistance on the \$SPX..confirming exit LONG.

Why isnt it just a pullback ?..the candlesticks stays below the 10EMA
with 2 long cascading long bars( as opposed to inisde bars) .Layer your
Short trades in.

Stay in the trend as long as it stays below the 10 moveing ave...add to
your position if any pullback does not cross the 10 move ave..

Sell at \$SPX support. I didnt..I got out at todays lows...

I have a few other ETFs..they follow \$SPX support n Resistance...XLF is
one of them.

P/s It helps if you use candlestick reversal patterns . which is showing
a reversal on the daily \$SPX..lets see what the market says tommorow.

<p>
Good luck ..this is a friendly tape for day traders...just stay out of
congestion zones.
