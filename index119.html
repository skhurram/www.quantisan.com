<p>Wrote some puts on ESLR for Dec08 at strike 5 for \$1.60. Yesterday
after market, news of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINN0534765020081106?rpc=44">a judge denying Evergreen request on return of
Barclays shares</a> sent the shares tumbling today. Furthermore, the
overall market is sinking on light volume since the election.</p>
<p>However, today's open 15min volume is about 40% lower than than the up
open volume on Monday at the same price level. In other words, the panic
selling isn't as that bad, although the price has dropped 12%.</p>
<p>Upside: Good up volume, light down volume on 15 min and daily chart for
the past week and more. Broad market selloff shows positive divergence
on various indicators intraday. ESLR prices retraced to about 62% of
fibonacci level and bouncing back up.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$6, peaked at \$5.72 a couple of days ago too and
congestion at that point from farther back.</p>
<p>Downside: Broad market selloff. Low volume rally before election. Low
volume selloff after election. Just low volume all week in the market.
ESLR not profitable yet. Factory done next June. Difficult to raise
capital to expand production to meet backlog in these times.</p>
<p>Support: 20 dma at \$3.50.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Recent solar rally looked strong. Company outlook seems
good. Profit taking retracement plus the overnight bad news together
haven't broken the new uptrend yet. This will again be a bullish swing
trade.</p>
<p>The broad market shouldn't fall to a new low prior to breaking some
highs. Everyone that wants to sell has sold in the October crash
already. We need some new highs and optimism to lure in new blood to be
sucked on by the pros before another crash can be profitable to them.</p>

<p>Looking like we're oversold on the market. DELL is holding up nicely
today despite the 30+ drop in S&amp;P. So I'm putting in a swing trade with
a short put Dec08 DELL 13 strike @ 1.29.</p>
<p>Upside: Strength in DELL shares (positive change) in light of a down
market today. Up volume seems slightly more than down volume for past
few days on DELL too. Broad market price weakness not supported by
intraday TICK and A-D line. Short term reversal expected.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$14 then primary at pre-crash low about \$15.</p>
<p>Downside: DELL price still in narrow trading range. We are not on the
high side in that range. General market rally not supported by volume
yet.</p>
<p>Support: Lower trading range of \$12.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Today's market weakness seems unsupported based on intraday
data. I entered this at about 974 on the S&amp;P 500 after touching 972.
This is a short term bullish position.</p>

<p>Covered my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-5-slw-100-dec08-75-put-400-lmt/">short puts SLW @ \$4.00</a> for \$3.40 today. Fee \$7.50.</p>
<p>This is to reduce my risk on the current weak precious metal market.
Silver is failing to break above \$10.6 so far. Gold is down \$14 or so
to below \$750, an important support level.</p>
<p>The weakness seen today after the election is likely a shakeout for an
imminent rally. However, my leveraged position in SLW is too risky due
to weakness in both the equity and precious metal markets, even for the
short term. So I'm unloading it for now to wait for a re-entry. My
strategy with the options is to hold it as short as possible for the
most profit. So I'll be taking swing positions and trade in and out.</p>
<p>In any case, I still have my SLW shares to ride the wave if we do make a
move.</p>
<p>Update: S&amp;P is down 33 to 972 from around 988 when I sold. Yet, SLW is
holding up nicely. This is a very good sign for SLW.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The major reoccurring problem I have in trading is not being objective
enough in my decision. A recent example is entering the market just
before the October crash and held on to the shares even <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/didnt-cut-losses-as-planned-and-now-paying-dearly/">when I doubted
my positions</a>. On the other hand, for the times when I executed a
trade as planned, I showed remarkable ability to make <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-of-the-day-bailed-out-of-a-wrong-position/">sound decisions
on the fly even under strenuous conditions</a>. Thus, it is in my best
interest to perform consistently and learn to be objective in my market
analysis.</p>
<p>I have come up with two solutions for my problem. 1) Make more use of
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">computational tools</a> and 2) improve my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-psychology/">trading psychology</a>.</p>
<p>In this particular post, I'd like to address my psychological barriers.
Coincidentally, a book I've been reading about conflict resolution
(Stone, et. al., "<em>Difficult Conversations</em>," pg 38+) has suggested
techniques that I think can be applied for trading.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, we argue with other people because of
difference of opinions. Similarly, we lose money in the market because
we are <em>arguing</em> with the market. The first step in conflict resolution
is understanding ourselves.</p>
<p>As best as we might try to remove emotion in our trading decision, the
tendency to develop unconsciously biased perception is very human. Our
perception about a situation is based on</p>
<ol>
<li>our selection of information</li>
<li>our interpretation</li>
<li>our conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>Some people use candlestick charts, some uses line graphs. A bullish
crossover on the RSI can mean a turn of sentiment to some or imminent
opportunity to short for others. These are just some examples of how we
add our personal touch to each problem. Indeed, I don't think
eliminating emotion from the equation is advisable. It is our
experience, our knowledge, and our skills that we should rely on to make
tough decisions. Since decisions happen so fast and generally involve
more subconscious than not, we are not aware of all the influences of
our views.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
One way to keep an unbiased opinion is to thoroughly understand how you
came to a conclusion. Why did we select one information over the other?
What assumptions are we making in an interpretation? How did we come up
with a conclusion based on our interpretations? In other words, shift
from a certain stance about our conclusion to a curious state about the
entire thinking process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One way to shift your stance from the easy certainty of feeling that
you've thought about this from every possible angle is to get curious
about what you don't know about yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping an open mind with a curious approach can help you evaluate
wether your views make sense in light of new information and
perspective.</p>
<p></p>
For example, the way I analyze a potential <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/entry/">trade entry</a> is to think
from both sides of the trade (go long or go short). Ultimately, I enter
the trade as planned if my analysis is stronger than the
counter-arguments.</p> </div>
