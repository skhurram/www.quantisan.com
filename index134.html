on the recent peak, both MACD and Stochastic failed to go higher. This
could be a bearish divergence. I almost wanted to short Gold before the
FED meeting.</p>
<p>However, I entered on 4 long positions based on the fundamentals. As
Bill Cara wrote today, "Is there any doubt that the gold price is going
to advance and that liquidity will continue to dry up in global equity
markets?"</p>
<p>Another hint is that although the day opened lower, the technicals edged
higher as we approach the FED meeting time.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6DeihzQQmI/AAAAAAAAAL0/-POEn-3h4gE/s400/gold.jpg" />][]The position is in positive as I type this. However, tomorrow
should be more telling as the Asian and European decides what to make of
the 50 pts FED cut. My target is \$1000 but will probably exit by Friday
based on what happens then.</p>

pretty quiet before the announcement. Then at about 2:14pm, the price
broke up because the FED lowered interest rate another 50 pts to 3% as
expected.</p>
<p>I tried my scalping strategy explained a few days ago, it didn't work!
After losing about \$1000 in the past week on these scalping trades, I
think it's time to admit that I suck at it and stop doing it! A few
bucks here and a few there accumulated so quickly.
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Until I have thoroughly developed and
backtested a strategy, I should not use it in trading.</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, my Keltner + Stochastic strategy is working well. The
only problem now is that I need to be more confident about it and let my
profit run. See this graph below of this fading trade I took after the
price shot up on the FED outcome. I knew that it's going to come back
down to fill the gap. And I knew that I shouldn't be reading my fast
time frame. Instead, if I enter on the intermediate time frame, then I
should exit on the intermediate time frame too. I knew that the bounce
would take us to the other side of the channel but I exited way too
early because I looked at my fast time frame and lost confident.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6DcshzQQkI/AAAAAAAAALk/Tb9XerDhN7A/s400/er2_dive.jpg" />][] The reason is that earlier today, I had full intention of
waiting for exit signal on the intermediate time frame, but the \$200
bounce ended up to be fake and I closed out at a little loss on that
trade. The price movement seemed the same at the time of my exit, so
that spooked me out of a potential \$700 more profit. I really shouldn't
let my loses cloud my judgement. I should just learn from it and move
on. In hindsight, the difference is that this afternoon trade had a HUGE
run prior to it and my CCI + Stochastic signal was on too, whereas the
moring losing trade only moved from mid channel and CCI signal wasn't
on. Lesson here is that <span style="font-weight:bold;">if there are
more than one BUY/SELL signal on, then the move would have higher
probability and would be bigger too</span>.</p>
<p>There's still a lot for me to learn.</p>

is happening today. As such, the day is mostly inside a trading range. I
should have taken the first SELL signal just before the open because it
was the biggest move. I didn't take it because it was before the day
session and I was worried of market manipulations.</p>
<p>However, upon looking at the past few days' of data, it seems that even
pre-market signals seem reliable on ER2. I will consider entering a
position outside of the day hours in the future.</p>
<p>Not much happened today. I sort of used Stochastic to try to trade
today, but it wasn't very reliable. In addition, I observed the price
movement and used mostly instinct and chart pattern to trade. It didn't
turn out too well but I did develop a new strategy based on it and it
seems to be good.</p>
<p>I realize that I need more strategies to capture more market movements.
Having just 1 setup is very limiting. I was down for most of the day but
made it back into the black after 3pm. The
<span style="font-weight:bold;">first hour or two and the last hour are
really good on ER2</span> because there are more activities and more
moves in those times.</p>
<p>I also looked at other markets today. The S&amp;P Midcap 400 seems good too
but it moves like the YM and ER2, so there's not much point in trading
it with ER2. It just doesn't provide diversification to trade heavily
correlated markets.</p>
<p>I also looked at some FX futures, but the ATR is too big. It would be
good to trade it on a longer term once I have enough capital.</p>
<p>For now, I'll stick with ER2 and try to develop more strategies.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5_DdhzQQgI/AAAAAAAAALE/M5s45en_Vdg/s400/doubletop.jpg" />][]Added a simple ShowMe to my fast period chart of my day trading
workspace for scalping. The idea here is that often times, the price
would top/bottom at some points and then change direction momentarily
for a breather. This doesn't necessarily signal a trend reversal, but
more often a quick retracement of the price for a breather. So an exit
bracket should be used with Stop just outside of the top/btm and a
profit target based on the ATR.</p>
<p>The second condition used is a Fast Stochastic divergence. The third
condition is that the Stochastic has to be in OB or OS zone.</p>
<p>Update: This ShowMe is popping too many times in real-time. Because in
real-time, open = high = low when the bar opens. Then when the price
goes down, stochastic would go down too and so the ShowMe would go on.</p>
