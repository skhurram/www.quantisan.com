            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I was just reading <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/18/090518fa_fact_lehrer">this article in The New Yorker</a> and I am impressed
by it so much so that I'd like to log this in my trading journal.</p>
<p>The article is about a simple study done in the 60's with hundreds of
kids being asked to resist the temptation to a table-full of candies
while waiting for the researcher to come back into the room. Years
later, the researcher find that those that is able to delay instant
gratification are more successful later in life.</p>
<p>I've read about this study before, but this article is a lot more
comprehensive than what I've seen. Anyway, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/18/090518fa_fact_lehrer">read the article</a> for the details.</p>
<p>
So what's so special about having self-control? The article and the
researcher puts it poignantly.

> For decades, psychologists have focussed on raw intelligence as the
> most important variable when it comes to predicting success in life.
> Mischel argues that intelligence is largely at the mercy of
> self-control: even the smartest kids still need to do their homework.
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re really measuring with the
> marshmallows isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t will power or
> self-control,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â? Mischel says.
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s much more important than that.
> This task forces kids to find a way to make the situation work for
> them. They want the second marshmallow, but how can they get it? We
> canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t control the world, but we can control how we
> think about it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â?

And how are some of these 4-year-old doing it?

> At the time, psychologists assumed that childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s
> ability to wait depended on how badly they wanted the marshmallow. But
> it soon became obvious that every child craved the extra treat. What,
> then, determined self-control? MischelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s conclusion,
> based on hundreds of hours of observation, was that the crucial skill
> was the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstrategic allocation of
> attention.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â? Instead of getting obsessed with the
> marshmallowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â?the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhot
> stimulusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â?the patient children
> distracted themselves by covering their eyes, pretending to play
> hide-and-seek underneath the desk, or singing songs from
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSesame Street.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â? Their desire
> wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t defeatedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â?it was merely
> forgotten. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re thinking about
> the marshmallow and how delicious it is, then youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re
> going to eat it,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â? Mischel says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe key
> is to avoid thinking about it in the first place.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â?

So what does this have to do with trading?

> In adults, this skill is often referred to as **metacognition**, or
> thinking about thinking, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what allows people
> to outsmart their shortcomings. (When Odysseus had himself tied to the
> shipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mast, he was using some of the skills of
> metacognition: knowing he wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be able to resist
> the SirensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ song, he made it impossible to give in.)
> MischelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s large data set from various studies allowed
> him to see that children with a more accurate understanding of the
> workings of self-control were better able to delay gratification.
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interesting about
> four-year-olds is that theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just figuring out
> **the rules of thinking**,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â? Mischel says.
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe kids who couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t delay would
> often have the rules backwards. They would think that the best way to
> resist the marshmallow is to stare right at it, to keep a close eye on
> the goal. But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a terrible idea. If you do that,
> youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to ring the bell before I leave the
> room.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â?

In other words, we need to identify our psychological issues in trading
and react to them before they destroy our accounts! One way I'm doing
this now is using [a set of clear and objective rules][].

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>One way to really distinguish the winners from the losers is to see how
they react when the market is against them. i.e. strong companies in a
weak market and weak companies in a strong market. Thus, this is as good
as time as ever to start preparing the next bull rally while the jury is
still out on rather the past few days has been mere consolidation or the
start of the next bear run already.</p>
<p>To start off my preparation, I am compiling a list of potential longs
for the next bull rally.</p>
<p>From my recent weekly reviews, it's evident that the techs and telecoms
will be the leaders. These two telecoms in particular look amazing on
the charts.</p>
<p>I picked these by comparing all the <a href="http://caracommunity.com/content/cara-global-100">Cara Global 100</a>'s
telecommunication sector companies using my own indicators screen,
Figure 2 and 4. Then I marked the important levels in Figures 1 and 3
and set up alerts for those levels.</p>
<p>I am definitely biased towards China Mobile because I've used their
service while I was in Hong Kong. But I can't neglect the equally
bullish Telefonica charts. However, CHL has a tighter range lately, so
they seem to be the winner for now for the lower risk.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've entered a short stop order just now set at \$13.00. GE is hovering
above \$13.10 now. S&amp;P500 bounced back about 1.3% today, as of this
writing, after yesterday's raid. However, S&amp;P500 merely tested 900 and
failed to go above it. This is definitely a strong sign for the bears.</p>
<p>Thus, I have decided to add to my short with GE. Why GE? See for
yourself in the figures below. It satisfy my usual criteria for a setup.
In addition, the risk/reward is great!</p>
<p>Entry stop: \$13.00.</p>
<p>Exit stop: \$13.30, short term resistance.</p>
<p>Target: \$10, nice round number just above the long term trendline.</p>
<p>Reward / risk = \$3 / \$0.30 = 10 > 3.</p>
<p>In Figure 1, note the symmetry in the daily chart. The test of
resistance below \$15 failed miserably. Also note the Chaikin in the
weekly for a huge negative divergence.</p>
<p>For Figure 3, observe that the recent uptrend is breaking. My entry of
\$13 is at the 25% point within the channel and it's a recent support.</p>
<p>Update: My order is filled at 15:38 for average of \$13.0042308 for 78
shares.</p>
<p>Update 2: I was stopped out at \$13.30 on Monday, May 18 at 10:23 am.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Following my stop order, SRS pushed on to beyond \$24.00 to touch
\$24.36. I took the opportunity to exit because \$24.50 is a major
resistance (Figure 1) and at the same time, S&amp;P500 touched 885, which is
a major support (Figure 2).</p>
<p>My total <strong>loss</strong> for this trade is -(\$6.10 - \$11.00) * 100 + \$15
commission = \$505... For what I thought would be a small play, this
amount of loss is totally unacceptable. There are a couple of lessons
here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always put a number to the risk you're willing to take.</li>
<li>Always adhere to stop levels.</li>
<li>Never enter a trade "in a rush" like I have done for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-srs-100-may-09-35-put-610/">this entry</a>.</li>
<li>Ultrashort ETF's are mathematically a losing game. Never go long in
    these again. However, they'll be great candidates to short.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've formalized my first 3 lessons into <a href="../3-rules/">my 3 Rules to be followed
religiously</a>. And I have also gone back to the <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tag/paper%20trade/">drawing board to work
on my trading strategy</a>. I must remember how much pain this trade has
caused and my determination to improve.</p>
<p></p>
Now, I still have 31 shares of SRS to unload after this...</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>S&amp;P 500 backed down below 900 today. In particular, 890-900 seem like a
vital pivot point from intraday action. Since SRS popped 10.45% today
already, I have done something which I should have done when I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-srs-100-may-09-35-put-610/">wrote
this put for SRS for \$6.10 in April 9th</a>. That is, adding a stop. My
stop to buy back this put is set at \$11.90, or effectively about \$23.3
for the underlying SRS shares. The closest intraday support as of this
moment is \$23.40 for SRS shares, just when S&amp;P500 retraced back to 895
or so. But SRS quickly regained footing to \$23.70+ (another pivot).</p>
<p>I am putting a loose stop for now because there seems to be more
momentum for this market decline from the intraday sentiment. I'll
update my stop as we approach the close today. Since this option expires
Friday, I need to get rid of it one way or another before it does.</p>

<p>As a side note, the May <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/using-option-pain-max-pain-to-estimate-stock-price/">options max pain</a>for SPY is pegged at \$86.
Are we going to retrace to that level by this Friday?</p>

financial system (note the sarcasm) according to the FED, see WSJ:
