            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p><span>I bumped into a myriads of obstacles setting up the
<span>JForex</span> trading platform on an </span><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/rev-your-trading-system-on-the-cloud-with-a-free-amazon-cloud-server/">Amazon AWS's free
t1.micro<span> <span>intance</span></span></a>. I will go through the
steps I went through to setup a cloud server for JForex in this post. In
the end, I find out that the t1.micro instance chokes up from running
the GNOME desktop environment on Ubuntu Maverick. I enabled Amazon's
CloudMonitor utility and the CPU measurement is locked at 100% from
running the JForex platform and the desktop. This is expected as I
suspected that the t1.micro wouldn't be able to handle all that graphics
display. I chose to run Ubuntu on EC2 because that's what I'm familiar
with at home. I also considered running CentOS because it is legendary
as an enterprise server. Yet I read reviews from individuals running
their own private VPS saying that <a href="http://knol.google.com/k/tom-harrison/centos-vs-ubuntu/24f5zicu9nl0z/1">CentOS is very secure but it is too
"tight-assed"</a>. As JForex needs a relatively recent commercial Sun
Java version to run, I chose a easier Linux distro for my EC2 instance.
A minor gripe I have with Ubuntu is that their EBS Amazon Machine Image
(AMI) comes in 15 GB. Whereas the free offer from Amazon only provides
10 GB of free EBS use. So there's a 5 GB extra that will be charged on a
monthly basis. This has been discussed on the developer forum and it
looks as though <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-on-ec2/+bug/670161">subsequent versions of Ubuntu release AMI will be in
10GB</a>. However, this 5 GB amounts to only \$0.55 a month. Still, I
want free! I started out my trial on EC2 using the server variant of
Ubuntu. It has less clutter and potentially more secure than the regular
desktop variant. However, getting remote desktop running on the server
took me two evenings to figure out! My problem is in getting a NX server
to work. I tried the commercial, but free, <a href="http://www.nomachine.com/">nxserver from NoMachine</a>.
I tried the GPL implementation, <a href="http://freenx.berlios.de/">FreeNX</a>. And I tried Google's open
source adaptation, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/neatx/">Neatx</a>. It just wouldn't work! As soon as I solved
one problem something else breaks. At first it was an <a href="http://www.jsiegel.com/2008/06/installing-nx-on-amazons-ec2-centos.html">authentication
problem</a> because the SSH keys were mixed between the NX server and SSH
server. Then once that's resolved, the desktop just wouldn't start and
without any error message to tell me what's wrong. That's when I gave up
on NX and switched to using <a href="http://www.x2go.org">X2go</a>. It only took me a few minutes to
install X2go. It ran fine fresh from installation. So many hours wasted
on NX. Once I had my remote desktop running, I tried to install Sun Java
for JForex. After a few failed attempts, I found out about <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/+bug/634487">this
problem</a>. Apparently there's a kernel bug on Ubuntu in which
installing Sun Java on a t1.micro would crash the installer. Just my
luck. By then my curiosity waned and it's just a matter of getting the
job done. So I restarted the whole setup process yet another time with a
Ubuntu 10.10 desktop edition (has been using server edition) 64-bit (to
circumvent the Sun Java installation bug), installed Sun Java, Google
Chrome, and X2go. Logged in to the remote desktop through X2go. Launched
Chrome to access the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy website</a>. Started JForex. It takes
only a few minutes once I know what I'm doing. Then I watched the
t1.micro instance come to a crawl. There's my first attempt at running
JForex on a free t1.micro. My recommendation? <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">Don't do it</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Numerical calculation performance matters if you're calculating gigantic
datasets or have limited processing capability. I belong in the latter
case as I intend to run my trading system on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/rev-your-trading-system-on-the-cloud-with-a-free-amazon-cloud-server/">a free cloud server</a> in
the future. There are plenty of research and studies to push the
boundary of high-performance numerical computing in Java (see ref. 1 and
2). Most of the latest and greatest is beyond the scope of my
quantitative work. What I seek is performance with simplicity and
efficiency. That is how I became aware of the <a href="http://acs.lbl.gov/software/colt/">Colt Project</a> by CERN,
and its <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/piotrwendykier/software/parallelcolt">multi-threaded branch</a>. Colt is a set of open source Java
libraries for scientific and technical computing problems characterized
by large data sizes while demanding high performance and low memory
footprint. Just what I needed. Out of curiosity, I tested its
implementation of double arrays and compared its performance to standard
Java libraries.</p>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>A random sample of a million decimal values (e.g. prices) are generated
and stored in four Java data structures. All data structures have the
same one million values in their own respective memory spaces.</p>
<ol>
<li>Primitive double array</li>
<li>ArrayList of Double objects</li>
<li>Colt</li>
<li>Parallel Colt</li>
</ol>
<p>Three tests were ran.</p>
<ol>
<li>A simple <em>diff</em> function. A traversal of the million data points and
    calculating array[i] - array[i - shift] for all <em>i = shift to
    1,000,000</em>. Where <em>shift</em> is a random integer from 0 to 50. This
    type of calculation is common place in technical analysis
    indicators.</li>
<li>A sort function sorting the million data points in the array in
    ascending order. This come in handy for some statistical analysis.
    In the case of the primitive array, I am using
    java.util.Arrays.sort(). Otherwise I'm using the sort() method
    implicit in the other interfaces.</li>
<li>A binary search function on the sorted arrays. For the primitive
    array, I am using java.util.Arrays.binarySearch().</li>
</ol>
<p>Each test is ran 3 times with different random seeds and the results are
averaged. The system runs Java SE build 1.6.0_22-b04 and Linux kernel
2.6.35-22 on an Intel Core 2 Duo 6300 @ 1.86 GHz.</p>
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>For the diff, primitive array averaged 9.3 millisecond; ArrayList 27
ms.; Colt 14 ms.; Parallel Colt 15 ms. For sort, primitive 354.7 ms.;
ArrayList 1,316 ms.; Colt 270.3 ms.; Parallel Colt 273 ms. For search,
primitive 559.7 ms.; ArrayList 1,561.7 ms.; Colt 575.7 ms.; Parallel
Colt 551.3 ms.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>As this isn't a vigorous test, I wouldn't mind too much on the actual
numbers. The take home message here is that the performance of Colt is
at least in the same magnitude of a primitive array. Whereas a standard
ArrayList object is a magnitude worse. However, where Colt really shines
is in its methods for handling matrices. It offers plenty of convenient
functions for matrix calculations while guaranteeing good performance.
To work with matrices in Java, you either use third-party libraries such
as Colt or manage a bunch of <em>for</em> loops. Which isn't pretty.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I always try to keep my trading and any related costs as cheap as
possible. And there's nothing cheaper than free, which that is what
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is offering starting November 1, 2010. They
are offering a full year of free t1.micro EC2 instance along with other
basic level of AWS services (see link below). That seems to be a great
incentive to move my trading system on to a remote cloud server. One of
the biggest benefits of running your trading system on a virtual private
server or a cloud instance is reliability. I don't know about you, but
my internet connection sometimes acts up or even goes down for hours.
There's the occasional electrical power disruption too, but it's been
good these days. On the other hand, there are many disadvantages for
running your trading system remotely. Costs, technical know-hows, and
limited processing power, just to name a few. The added costs is not an
issue for now as Amazon is offering a year of free trial. With regard to
technical know-hows, I don't know how to setup a cloud server yet.
Although it shouldn't be a terribly difficult task for me as I am
familiar with Linux. What's at issue though, is the limited processing
power. The processing power of a t1.micro instance is an unspecified
fraction of one ECU, which is equivalent to a 1 GHz 2007 Intel Xeon
processor. So you get a fraction of that, which doesn't sound much.
CloudHarmony's benchmark shows that <a href="http://cloudharmony.com/benchmarks">a Micro instance is about 1/10th of
that of the Small instance</a>. However, a Micro instance can burst to up
to 2 ECUs (double that of the Small) of processing power occasionally.
This is good if you can keep your continuous processes minimal and only
make calculations infrequently (such as on arrival of a new price bar).
The t1.micro gets 613 MB of memory along with 10 GB of EBS (for
low-latency files) and 5 GB of S3 (for persistent storage). These
numbers are generous, so the bottleneck obviously remains with the
processor. Your best bet for minimal background processing use is to run
a command-line-only trading system. That's something that can be easily
done on JForex. However, there remains the question of is the minimum
power of a Micro sufficient to sustain a trading system? Any hiccup in a
trading system could cost you more than the annual charge for even a
Small instance. This freebie from Amazon may not be worth the risk. The
only way to know is to test it out. I won't be able to get to that soon
as I'm been busy programming. So if anyone is running a trading system
on a t1.micro instance, I'd really appreciate if you can provide some
feedback. Update Nov 6: See <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/first-time-setting-up-jforex-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">my first failed test</a> and then my first
time <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">running remote desktop on t1.micro</a>. Otherwise, enjoy the
freebie, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">AWS Free Usage Tier</a>.</p> </div>
