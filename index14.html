            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am more than half way through my first speed run of the CFA level 1
material. This chapter discusses portfolio management. In particular, I
just read the Markovitz Efficient Frontier. What strikes me most about
this chapter is that these mathematical material are presented so
matter-of-factly. Recalling in chapter 1, Ethics, the idea of prudence
and due diligence was evident. This was exemplified later in the
Financial Statement chapter. Methods of drafting balance sheet, income
statement, and cash flow statement were presented in excrutiating
details before a discussion about ways to analyze them. Just so we can
understand the mechanics of it to spot bias, pitfalls,
misrepresentation, and outright frauds. In fact, a good portion of the
section were reserved for discussing the caveats in financial statement
analysis. As boring as it was to sit through the accounting details,
that was good prudence and good due diligence. Fast forward to this
discussion on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), it is simply explained in
the text that expected risk of a portfolio with individual asset
correlations less than 1 will be less than its weighted average risk.
Where are the billboard-sized warnings and neon-red danger signs?
Perhaps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory#Criticism">criticisms of MPT</a> will be discussed later or perhaps I
simply missed it with my \~200 pages/day scanning pace (in which case,
just ignore me). But if I don't see a caveat lector on MPT in bold,
underlined, and boxed fonts later, then I am surely going to be very
disappointed. This is a big deal because of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-volatile-week-and-no-sign-of-the-bull-yet/">historic events of
2008</a>. In which we witnessed the havoc caused by countless funds that
blindedly rely on MPT's validity (i.e. diversification of risks on the
naive basis of constant correlations and normally distributed returns),
and <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/77bf5f98-4441-11e0-931d-00144feab49a.html">other risk models</a>, go under. There can be no worse mistake than
underestimating your risk in trading. Let me repeat that, there can be
no worse mistake than underestimating your risk in trading. <em>Careless
use of MPT</em> (not MPT, per se) leads to exactly that. The problem is that
people take these financial theories to heart too much without reading
the fine prints. Just because it is presented in mathematical formulas
does not mean a theory is law. The least the CFA text can do is to
broaden financial prudence from not only dissecting financial statements
but to encompass other important intellectual matter related to the job
too. I am appalled by the fact that thousands of CFA level 1 hopefuls
might actually believe that you can always reduce portfolio risk and
identify an efficient asset mix from mere correlations and standard
deviations (which in and of themselves are flawed in the real world),
with no strings attached. "Science is the belief in the ignorance of the
experts", Richard Feynman.</p> </div>

My study guide for a professional exam in financial analysis arrived
last Friday. I spent most of this weekend studying as I need to squeeze
in 300 hours of studying time between now and the exam in June. Topics
of the exam range from professional standards to investment analysis to
asset management. This is a major commitment as 300 hours in 3 months is
no joke. Fortunately, I am familiar with a majority of the material.
Unfortunately, most of the details I have forgotten already as level 1
of this exam covers the very basic. For example, I haven't heard terms
like price elasticity and marginal cost in 10 years. The quant section,
at least, I am finding it to be a breeze as I finished skimming through
the 400 pages of material in a few hours and realized that I don't need
to spend anymore time on statistics or technical analysis to answer the
practice questions. Having said that, I do not take this exam lightly
and will have to put most other work on hold. This is a difficult
decision because having spent hours and hours in the past few months
over our trading system, it is coming to shape. In fact, I just tape-out
a major component of it last Friday. Studying with this curriculum would
provide me with a big picture perspective of financial analysis. Still,
I would rather spend the time to study pertinent works like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071592539?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=quantisan-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0071592539">Security

still couldn't fully appreciate yet. Better yet, I want to finish my
trading system prototype as soon as possible because I've learned so
much in bringing these systems (having gone through several incarnations
already) to life than anything else I have done previously. However, it
is also because of my desire to do this for the long term that I need to
take the time to garner some industry recognition. As superfluous as
doing an exam might seem for my outside-of-the-box approach to the
market (mostly out of necessity as I have neither the bank roll nor
brain cells to directly compete with the sharks), the fact is, to be
successful in this industry, I need experience, skills, and credibility.
The latter of which is something I lack. Neither Graham, Hamilton, nor
Adelson can provide me with credibility that these three letters can --

            <div class="article-content"> <p>It looks as though the first hedge fund utilizing social media data is
about to <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/41251767/">launch in April</a>. This "Twitter hedge fund" is based on the
work of Bollen et al., "<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1010.3003">Twitter mood predicts the stock market</a>,"
Journal of Computational Science, 2011. In more general terms, this is
an example use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing</a> (NLP) to assess the
semantic of tweets relating to the stock market. NLP, or more
specifically semantic search, has been the holy grail of search engine
companies since people realized that you can make a boatload of money by
providing good search results. Semantic search improve search accuracy
by understanding the seacher's <em>intent</em> and the <em>contextual meaning</em>
rather than going on the vocabulary alone (see Nature: <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110215/full/news.2011.95.html">Quiz-playing
computer system could revolutionize research</a>). What Bollen et al. are
proposing is a subset of the grander NLP problem, in that they are only
concerned with the "mood states" rather than the whole meaning of the
tweets. In other words, sentiment analysis. NLP is not new. R, for
example, has a <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/NaturalLanguageProcessing.html">Natural Language Processing task view</a>. Python has a
<a href="http://www.nltk.org">Natural Language Toolkit</a>. Wikipedia has a good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_language_processing_toolkits">list of NLP
toolkits</a> for other languages. Traders understand that the market is
driven by people, and people are ultimately driven by emotions. So far,
there hasn't been a method to directly evaluate the emotions of market
participants. Would social media provide a glimpse to the emotions of
the masses? According to Bollen et al., yes. At any rate, data is king
in quantitative trading. I have no idea would their particular
implementation of data mining social media work or not. What's true is
that as more and more people publish their lives on the internet, all
these non-quantitative information are just waiting to be exploited.
Ethics and privacy issues aside, look at what Facebook is doing with
their ads as an example. In addition to time, volume, and price, data
mining social media may provide us with a fourth dimension to market
data.</p> </div>
