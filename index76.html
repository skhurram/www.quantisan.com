<p>I covered my last short put. Bought ABB Nov 12.5 put for \$1.95 (bid:
\$1.8, ask \$2.05 at the time). I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-170/">shorted this ABB put at \$1.70</a>. As
I've opined yesterday, things don't look good on the market. Despite <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">my
earlier optimism for a bear rally</a>, the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/monday-after-the-last-minute-market-dive-outlook-for-the-rest-of-the-day/">market obviously haven't
followed through</a>. The reality is that there's a good possibility of
another market crash at this critical support level. Thus, I have exited
today on signs of weakness.</p>
<p>On the broad market, the S&amp;P failed to push through the morning when I
made this trade. Figure 2 shows a double top at 865 with corresponding
double top in the TICK (neutral read) and lower Advance-Decline line
(bearish read).</p>
<p>Another point is that ABB today merely filled the down gap, and this
second retest of 865 on S&amp;P only led to a lower low with lower volume.
In terms of intraday move, this is very bearish.</p>
<p>So rather than sit tight and hope for the best, I unloaded this last
short put as planned to reduce my downside risk.</p>
<p>I still have plenty of long calls in ABB and others if we do rally from
here. I am still very bullish on ABB from its fundamental and signs of
big block accumulations recently. Just that with only 3 more days until
options expiration, I can't risk having the shares put to me now that
I'm low on cash from all the greedy calls buying in the last few days.</p>

<p>The market is hanging by a thread at the moment. S&amp;P is trading just
above 850, a major support. I don't know if we're going to break down
from here. The probability doesn't seem to favour either way
significantly. With my deep long positions, I simply can't risk the
possibility of another meltdown in market.</p>
<p>That's why I have ditched my SAP short put to minimize my risk and to
sleep better for the rest of the option expiration week. I decided to
dump SAP because it looks like it has the most downside of all my
options holdings. I don't want to unload my equity share holdings now
because I can wait on those, otherwise I would have dumped <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/eslr/">ESLR</a> or
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/dell/">DELL</a>. SAP share price is just sitting on a major support level, and
a head and shoulder neckline too. If it breaks from here, it could
trigger a lot of stops and drop down too fast for me to cover.</p>
<p>I shorted the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-sap-100-nov-08-375-put-340/">SAP Nov 37.5 put for \$3.40</a> and just covered them for
\$4.20 (accepted the ask price). That is a major loss of \$80 + \$15
commission.</p>

<p>Just a plethora of horrible news for TCK lately. Last week on 11/11,
<a href="http://www.financialpost.com/trading_desk/mining/story.html?id=950874">Financial Post published an article</a> about it. TCK gapped down on
11/12. Even the Motley Fool has an article titled "What the Heck, Teck?"</p>
<p>TCK share price seem to be settling in \$5 - \$6. So why the heck am I
long now? Ignoring the hypes, the fundamentals of TCK still stand. See
the Motley Fool article. It has \$2.7 cash/share and 0.17 debt/equity
ratio. Granted, it took on \$9.8 billion of debt recently, about <em>4
times its current market cap.</em>!</p>
<p>The technicals though, are looking good. On the daily chart, the VW-MACD
is showing a positive divergence. The CO has reached an unprecedented
low and is just heading back up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the commodities are showing signs of a positive divergence
too.</p>
<p>Upside: In addition to the above, Max Pain is at \$30 (\$10 for CBOE
data) for November! Yes, \$30!</p>
<p>Resistance: \$6</p>
<p>Downside: Same reasons why TCK has dropped from \$30 to \$5. Possibility
of defaulting on massive loan.</p>
<p>Support: \$5</p>
<p>Bottom line: Max pain at \$30 when we're just below \$6! TCK is a
diversified miner, a value <em>producing</em> company. TCK and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/abb/">ABB</a> are now
my top choices in this struggling economy.</p>

<p>I recall somebody said that the opening is a good indication of retail
trader (the non-pros) emotions. After <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-market-crashed-friday-again-now-what/">Friday's last minute 40 point
drop on the S&amp;P</a>, things couldn't be more orderly this morning. Yes,
the opening volume is high, but it's still below that of most of the
days last week. Considering that we just witnessed a possible failed
rally on Friday, the negativity is expected. So we're continuing to
drift downward. That is expected too.</p>
<p>But with the media's doom and gloom without offering anything new over
the weekend, I had expected something worse. For example, we just broken
the 855 support (the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">61.8% fibo retracement target I mentioned</a>) as
I'm writing but the fall stopped at 850. There're a lot of <strong>hessitation
in the selling</strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all these testings of support seem like a test of
conviction to me. They look too textbook perfect to be real. I don't
know, perhaps this is the real deal and the inevitable fall is only
being held up by people like me.</p>
<p>In any case, since my prices are still well above my stops, I am not
selling on this low volume test of support just yet. There's just too
much fear going around this morning to be selling. I'd rather wait til
the afternoon. The closing hour today would be a good tell if this bear
rally has failed.</p>
<p>Update: It's 11am now and it's amazing to see that we're exhibiting the
<em>exact</em> same pattern as Friday morning ... Take a look at the updated
Figure 2. The price, the TICK, and even the A-D line are almost
identical! A late day rally and then a fake down can shake out many weak
bulls or trap some bears when everyone expects a breakdown like the late
day Friday. And then a real rally could commence? This is just wishful
thinking, don't read too much into it.</p>
<p>Update 2: S&amp;P closed right at 850 today. The market weakened in the last
hour. The prospect for a rally is looking dimmer. I hessitated to sell
my ABB short puts when it failed to break \$11.10 late in the day. I
have set my limit order too low (at bid price) and let the price got
away from me. I think this mistake is going to cost me.</p>

<p>Just when I thought I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">don't have to watch the market every hour</a> and
left for the afternoon, the S&amp;P 500 crashed 40 points in the last hour
on Friday. In particular, the move in the last 5 minutes was <em>vertical</em>
for all intents and purposes!</p>
<p>Looking at the TICK and Advance-Decline line, there doesn't seem to be a
broad sell-off as the panic-like move would suggest. This seems like a
concentrated sell-off effort. Which <em>might</em> suggest of an artificial
move directed for the G20 meeting this weekend. Read that with a grain
of salt though, this is wild speculation at best.</p>
<p>Actually, what's important is that Thursday's rally energy didn't carry
over to Friday. Notice on Figure 1 that even the mid-day 870 reversal
didn't pack much punch. We have double topped with a lower volume
weighted MACD (Figure 1). This is a bad bearing divergence. 920 would
have been a good point to unload when the volume didn't pick up. But I
was away anyway, and I doubt I would have the insight at the time to
unload.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we are still above my line in the sand at 865. And as
I've mentioned before, the TICK and A-D line are giving a neutral
reading. My short term bullishness hasn't died yet, but we could very
well retest 820 before moving up. Even worse, I am now accepting the
possiblity of continued weakness in the market due to lack of steam.
Bull shakeout or not, this pre-weekend stunt has definitely shaken many
bulls.</p>
<p>I will watch the market next week and decide what I'll do with my long
positions. At this point, I am inclined to unload my short puts some
time next week to reduce my downside. As for my calls, with just another
week until option expiration, I would rather hang on to them to position
myself for a rally. I got my calls all for dirt cheap anyway, so they
are entirely disposable if they expire next week. This is a great
example of my trading rule to <strong>always plan for the worst before
entering a trade</strong>.</p>
<p>Overall, my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">recent entries</a> are downgraded from a high reward, low
risk, high probability play to a high reward, low risk, low probability
play.</p>
<p>On a sidenote, one thing I noticed in the past two days is that there
doesn't seem to be any report from the mass media at all. The Thursday
95-point rally and Friday last minute crash were unnoticed by the
general public. These type of roller coaster volatilities seem to be
part of normal day lives nowadays.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the market, commodity traders have been going through
some wild rides this year. If anything, their ride is significantly more
thrilling because of the leverage.</p>
<p>Of all the commodities, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/gold/">Gold</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/silver/">Silver</a> are my favourites. Even
though I don't trade the futures market anymore, I still keep an eye on
them. Furthermore, I have a vested interest in precious metals because
of my exposure in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">SLW</a>.</p>
<p>As I have noted last month, I am <em>long</em> term <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-gold-and-silver-markets-perspective-october-2008/">bullish on precious
metals</a> like every one else. Heck, I think it's a one in a life time
investment opportunity. <em>In times of crisis, hoard gold.</em> And we are in
as bad a crisis as ever. Investment opportunity doesn't get any more
obvious that this. Yet, the reality is that we are in an obvious down
trend since the price highs in July 15. Coincidentally, we are exactly 4
months after that peak today.</p>
<p>Yesterday's bounce of the market coincided with a reversal in the
precious metal prices too. In fact, whereas today's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">market retraced</a>
a bit, the gold and silver prices continued higher. They are up 39 and
0.736 respectively to 743.50 and 9.54.</p>
<p>I must say, I am not as confident in analyzing commodity prices because
I lack an edge in the futures market. I merely look at the price and the
e-mini volumes. The e-mini's are just a small piece of the global
precious metal market. There are the full-size futures, various
exchanges around the world, the spot market, and what not. Then there's
the non-trivial relation of gold to US\$ exchange rates, since gold is a
world commodity but its price is based in the US dollar... and so on and
so forth.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll make do with what I have.</p>
<p>Looking at the gold and silver prices in the chart, we are still well
within a trading range. Could this be a turning point for them too? I
have no idea.</p>
<p>The way I play the gold and silver prices is simple -- I don't. I just
follow them. Even though we have shot up 70 points in gold, I think it's
too early to say if we're truly on the rise from here yet.</p>
<p>However, not that I'm just rambling here, I do have a point. I think
observing the prices of gold and silver around that marked trendline
around 757 and 10.3 will be the best indication yet. Since the wild
swings of recent prices in gold and silver have been spinning my head, I
think we are approaching a significant breakout.</p>
