                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/cibc-another-case-of-buy-the-rumours-sell-the-news/" rel='bookmark'>CIBC: Another case of buy the rumours, sell the news</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Today CIBC (NYSE ticker symbol: CM) announced their 2009 Q3 results. The
day before, CIBC shares were testing \$63 (in the states). Today, after
the announcement, CIBC opened at \$60.94.</p>
<p>Before the open, Bloomberg (for example) had this headline, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aZ3Jl5_CknSc">CIBC Profit
Rises Fivefold on Capital Markets.</a> Note the wording. This is not the
same as profits is five times as before. Did they hire a lawyer to write
this?</p>
<p>After the open, in which CIBC (CM) shares gapped down about 5% (!),
headlines such as Toronto Star's<span>
[<span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder_leftContentContainer_ListWebPart_SecondTierStories2_ctl00___Title__">TSX
falls on CIBC earnings</span>][]</span> began appearing at 10:30am.</p>
<p><strong>Edited:</strong> Before I finished writing this, Toronto Star updated the
above headline to read
[<span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder_article_NavWebPart_Article_ctl00___Title__">TSX
rises as U.S. housing numbers balance CIBC
earnings</span>][<span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder_leftContentContainer_ListWebPart_SecondTierStories2_ctl00___Title__">TSX
falls on CIBC
earnings</span>]<span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder_article_NavWebPart_Article_ctl00___Title__">.
Ha! Tell that to the people that bought into CIBC at the open on the
earlier story. CIBC is still trading below \$60 at this point. Although
they would probably think CIBC is "cheap" now that it's below \$60 with
its "profit rising five fold". </span></p>
<p>The stock market tradition of buying the rumours and then selling on the
news for a stock is well known. Think of it this way, if CIBC is tanking
on this positive news now, what event do you think in the immediate
future will lift its price up? Also consider that CIBC has run from
\$27.50 in March 2009 to \$65 in July! The selling and profit-taking
pressure is simply humongous on CIBC at the moment.</p>
<p>However, what I found amusing is the flip-floppinge of tone of the media
(I guess I should get used to it by now, but no). One moment they're
spinning the story this way and before you even got through the page,
they're spinning it another way.</p>
<p>This is yet another illustration of why I think most of the financial
mass media are nothing more than glorified advertisements.</p>
<p>Update 11 am: Bloomberg changed their headline on that first link to
"<span>CIBC Profit Misses Estimates on Loan-Loss Provision". </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Update 12:30pm:</strong> CIBC broke below \$59. If it breaks below
support at \$58.42 (Figure 2), then \$52.50 is just a breath away in
this roller coaster ride. </span></p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been seriously studying the forex market for the past couple of
weeks. This post is my first official jab in this area.</p>
<p>What better way than to start with the USD/CAD currency pair as I'm a
Canadian myself. And it just so happens that the USD/CAD is at a major
pivot these past couple of months. See Figure 1.</p>
<p>The fall of the USD/CAD from a peak around 1.60 in 2003 to below 0.90 in
2007 has been unforgettable. In fact, USD/CAD is still trading around
its shadow as seen in the test of both the resistance and support
Fibonacci fan lines (Figure 1).</p>
<p>While I'm not ready to predict which way the pair will trend (something
that rhymes with yup), it's clear that the fight between 1.0868 - 1.093
will be an important battle. Breaking below or above it would cause a
sizable short term move.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market made a new high for the year on Friday. There's no doubt that
the current trend is very bullish with the recent relentless climb since
March. See Figure 1.</p>
<p>However, why was 1025 on the S&amp;P500 (for example) so hard to break?
Since the market doesn't operate in a vacuum. Here's a look at S&amp;P500
ETF (SPY) v. the U.S. dollar (Figure 2) and v. Gold (Figure 3) for some
insights.</p>
<p>To invest in the U.S. market is a bet on the U.S. market (well
obviously) as well as the U.S. dollar. Because we're trading with U.S.
dollar in the U.S. market, its fluctuation will affect your return too.
Figure 2 is a chart of SPY divided by the U.S. dollar index (an
aggregate of the U.S. dollar v. other major currencies). In effect, it's
a normalized SPY chart with regards to the global currencies (and thus,
more or less the economies). As you can see, we just broke through a
long term resistance at 1.30 but is testing a Fibonacci level.</p>
<p>Similarly, the value of Gold is often used as a metric for currencies.
i.e. how much money is actually worth. Figure 3 is a chart of SPY
divided by the price of Gold. In effect, a normalized SPY chart with
regards to the real value of the U.S. dollar (since price of Gold is in
U.S. dollar).</p>
<p>Figure 3 is more telling. Although we've been moving higher and higher
in the raw SPY, you can clearly see that SPY/\$GOLD has been hitting a
ceiling since July. In other words, the market is going up because the
value of U.S. dollar is going down versus the companies these equities
represent.</p>
<p>While there's been much <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32506152/ns/business-stocks_and_economy/">talk of economic recovery</a> and a new <a href="http://online.barrons.com/article/SB125089288451150335.html">bull
market</a> is already with us, I still am not convinced just yet. True,
the bears might be MIA. But all signs say that this bull we're seeing is
standing on thin ice.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My limit order was executed at the open today for Capital One Financial
(COF). I placed this yesterday at the close and totally forgot about
it...</p>
<p>While we are testing a long term resistance (Figure 1, pink trendline at
top of chart) at about \$36, there is no confirmation yet. The recent
bullish momentum could very well sweep COF along to break it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a look at S&amp;P normalized by US Dollar Index shows the
market is also pushing up against a significant resistance. I will make
another post about this after the close today as a market analysis.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the divergence in sentiment based on high yield stocks or junk
bonds v. market price is as obvious as ever. Although this has been the
case for a while now, so this perspective doesn't hold much weight
anymore. The market simply can be irrational beyond anyone's guess.</p>
<p>Entry: \$35.89</p>
<p>Stop: Above \$35.00, by next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Target: \$33, by next week.</p>
<p>I've updated my risk metric for options to incorporate the time
parameter. A more thorough analysis can be gleaned from Figure 3 with
the expected value of the options at 1, 2, and 3 weeks from now.</p>
<p>To be more precise, the Profit/Loss on August 28 is -\$41.5 if COF =
\$36, and +\$110.6 if COF = \$33.</p>
<p>So the Reward / Risk = \$110.6 / \$41.5 = 2.7 \&lt; 5. The R/R is
predictably horrible. That's why I'm setting a tight stop on this. We'll
see how today's push higher plays out and I'll probably ditch this
sooner to minimize my risk.</p>
