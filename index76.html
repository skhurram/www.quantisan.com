<p>Just a plethora of horrible news for TCK lately. Last week on 11/11,
<a href="http://www.financialpost.com/trading_desk/mining/story.html?id=950874">Financial Post published an article</a> about it. TCK gapped down on
11/12. Even the Motley Fool has an article titled "What the Heck, Teck?"</p>
<p>TCK share price seem to be settling in \$5 - \$6. So why the heck am I
long now? Ignoring the hypes, the fundamentals of TCK still stand. See
the Motley Fool article. It has \$2.7 cash/share and 0.17 debt/equity
ratio. Granted, it took on \$9.8 billion of debt recently, about <em>4
times its current market cap.</em>!</p>
<p>The technicals though, are looking good. On the daily chart, the VW-MACD
is showing a positive divergence. The CO has reached an unprecedented
low and is just heading back up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the commodities are showing signs of a positive divergence
too.</p>
<p>Upside: In addition to the above, Max Pain is at \$30 (\$10 for CBOE
data) for November! Yes, \$30!</p>
<p>Resistance: \$6</p>
<p>Downside: Same reasons why TCK has dropped from \$30 to \$5. Possibility
of defaulting on massive loan.</p>
<p>Support: \$5</p>
<p>Bottom line: Max pain at \$30 when we're just below \$6! TCK is a
diversified miner, a value <em>producing</em> company. TCK and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/abb/">ABB</a> are now
my top choices in this struggling economy.</p>

<p>I recall somebody said that the opening is a good indication of retail
trader (the non-pros) emotions. After <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-market-crashed-friday-again-now-what/">Friday's last minute 40 point
drop on the S&amp;P</a>, things couldn't be more orderly this morning. Yes,
the opening volume is high, but it's still below that of most of the
days last week. Considering that we just witnessed a possible failed
rally on Friday, the negativity is expected. So we're continuing to
drift downward. That is expected too.</p>
<p>But with the media's doom and gloom without offering anything new over
the weekend, I had expected something worse. For example, we just broken
the 855 support (the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">61.8% fibo retracement target I mentioned</a>) as
I'm writing but the fall stopped at 850. There're a lot of <strong>hessitation
in the selling</strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all these testings of support seem like a test of
conviction to me. They look too textbook perfect to be real. I don't
know, perhaps this is the real deal and the inevitable fall is only
being held up by people like me.</p>
<p>In any case, since my prices are still well above my stops, I am not
selling on this low volume test of support just yet. There's just too
much fear going around this morning to be selling. I'd rather wait til
the afternoon. The closing hour today would be a good tell if this bear
rally has failed.</p>
<p>Update: It's 11am now and it's amazing to see that we're exhibiting the
<em>exact</em> same pattern as Friday morning ... Take a look at the updated
Figure 2. The price, the TICK, and even the A-D line are almost
identical! A late day rally and then a fake down can shake out many weak
bulls or trap some bears when everyone expects a breakdown like the late
day Friday. And then a real rally could commence? This is just wishful
thinking, don't read too much into it.</p>
<p>Update 2: S&amp;P closed right at 850 today. The market weakened in the last
hour. The prospect for a rally is looking dimmer. I hessitated to sell
my ABB short puts when it failed to break \$11.10 late in the day. I
have set my limit order too low (at bid price) and let the price got
away from me. I think this mistake is going to cost me.</p>

<p>Just when I thought I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">don't have to watch the market every hour</a> and
left for the afternoon, the S&amp;P 500 crashed 40 points in the last hour
on Friday. In particular, the move in the last 5 minutes was <em>vertical</em>
for all intents and purposes!</p>
<p>Looking at the TICK and Advance-Decline line, there doesn't seem to be a
broad sell-off as the panic-like move would suggest. This seems like a
concentrated sell-off effort. Which <em>might</em> suggest of an artificial
move directed for the G20 meeting this weekend. Read that with a grain
of salt though, this is wild speculation at best.</p>
<p>Actually, what's important is that Thursday's rally energy didn't carry
over to Friday. Notice on Figure 1 that even the mid-day 870 reversal
didn't pack much punch. We have double topped with a lower volume
weighted MACD (Figure 1). This is a bad bearing divergence. 920 would
have been a good point to unload when the volume didn't pick up. But I
was away anyway, and I doubt I would have the insight at the time to
unload.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we are still above my line in the sand at 865. And as
I've mentioned before, the TICK and A-D line are giving a neutral
reading. My short term bullishness hasn't died yet, but we could very
well retest 820 before moving up. Even worse, I am now accepting the
possiblity of continued weakness in the market due to lack of steam.
Bull shakeout or not, this pre-weekend stunt has definitely shaken many
bulls.</p>
<p>I will watch the market next week and decide what I'll do with my long
positions. At this point, I am inclined to unload my short puts some
time next week to reduce my downside. As for my calls, with just another
week until option expiration, I would rather hang on to them to position
myself for a rally. I got my calls all for dirt cheap anyway, so they
are entirely disposable if they expire next week. This is a great
example of my trading rule to <strong>always plan for the worst before
entering a trade</strong>.</p>
<p>Overall, my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">recent entries</a> are downgraded from a high reward, low
risk, high probability play to a high reward, low risk, low probability
play.</p>
<p>On a sidenote, one thing I noticed in the past two days is that there
doesn't seem to be any report from the mass media at all. The Thursday
95-point rally and Friday last minute crash were unnoticed by the
general public. These type of roller coaster volatilities seem to be
part of normal day lives nowadays.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the market, commodity traders have been going through
some wild rides this year. If anything, their ride is significantly more
thrilling because of the leverage.</p>
<p>Of all the commodities, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/gold/">Gold</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/silver/">Silver</a> are my favourites. Even
though I don't trade the futures market anymore, I still keep an eye on
them. Furthermore, I have a vested interest in precious metals because
of my exposure in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">SLW</a>.</p>
<p>As I have noted last month, I am <em>long</em> term <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-gold-and-silver-markets-perspective-october-2008/">bullish on precious
metals</a> like every one else. Heck, I think it's a one in a life time
investment opportunity. <em>In times of crisis, hoard gold.</em> And we are in
as bad a crisis as ever. Investment opportunity doesn't get any more
obvious that this. Yet, the reality is that we are in an obvious down
trend since the price highs in July 15. Coincidentally, we are exactly 4
months after that peak today.</p>
<p>Yesterday's bounce of the market coincided with a reversal in the
precious metal prices too. In fact, whereas today's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">market retraced</a>
a bit, the gold and silver prices continued higher. They are up 39 and
0.736 respectively to 743.50 and 9.54.</p>
<p>I must say, I am not as confident in analyzing commodity prices because
I lack an edge in the futures market. I merely look at the price and the
e-mini volumes. The e-mini's are just a small piece of the global
precious metal market. There are the full-size futures, various
exchanges around the world, the spot market, and what not. Then there's
the non-trivial relation of gold to US\$ exchange rates, since gold is a
world commodity but its price is based in the US dollar... and so on and
so forth.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll make do with what I have.</p>
<p>Looking at the gold and silver prices in the chart, we are still well
within a trading range. Could this be a turning point for them too? I
have no idea.</p>
<p>The way I play the gold and silver prices is simple -- I don't. I just
follow them. Even though we have shot up 70 points in gold, I think it's
too early to say if we're truly on the rise from here yet.</p>
<p>However, not that I'm just rambling here, I do have a point. I think
observing the prices of gold and silver around that marked trendline
around 757 and 10.3 will be the best indication yet. Since the wild
swings of recent prices in gold and silver have been spinning my head, I
think we are approaching a significant breakout.</p>

<p>The retracement from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-recollection-of-my-analysis-for-buying-when-sp-broke-down-to-820-today/">yesterday's monster reversal</a> is in progress. I
intend to take a more hands-off approach now and not have to hug my
market screen all day. It's just a more practical approach in the long
run for me.</p>
<p>So here's my after-lunch review of the market. The expected retracement
is under way. We have tested 870 on the S&amp;P and bounced off. The support
test volume was normal, but still 1/3 of yesterday's volume at about the
price level. I doubt we will break below this 870 intraday low today.</p>
<p>In particular, the pre-11am move looked good because we managed to keep
the 880 level. 880 is important because it's the resistance on Wednesday
and the first support level from yesterday's close. I didn't expect it
to hold because yesterday's 95 point move was a bit over done (like
everything else these days).</p>
<p>Even if the market breaks lower from here, we still have my mental
supporting line of SPY \$86.5 (high of the 30 min with the 2nd highest
volume time slot yesterday) and the fibonacci 61.8% of \$85.82 on the
SPY.</p>
<p>I will probably be off for the rest of the day. I haven't sold anything
yet, since we are in a retracement mode and the test looks strong so
far. I'd rather <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">sell on strength as planned</a>. It looks like we will
zig zag up from here at least for a few days.</p>
<p>Today's close will provide a sign of what I'll do with my positions next
week.</p>

<p>Finally! I have been waiting for a bear market rally for weeks! I
decided to go <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">full long after the bounce from 820 today</a>. Refer to
that post for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">details of my entries</a>. In this post, I would like to discuss why the 820 bounce
gave me the confidence in going all in despite widespread fear and the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/covered-slw-fro-and-wfc-short-puts/">many failed attempts</a> myself.</p>
<p>A quick recap of the past week's action. After the failed rally attempt
from 10/28 to 11/04, the market has been brutal to say the least. Any
strength failed to stir enthusiasm and has bled down slowly. The market
drifted down lower on little volume day after day. If I were to describe
the market, I'd say it looked like the last moment of a dying man. This
lack of will to move has certainly killed many bulls. I was one of them.
I have been stopped out a few times trying to catch this falling knife
(more like a grind). I even prepared to exit the last of my holdings if
we do break down from this point.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the day, the market looked like it's going to be
another down drift today. But being very near the 10/10 bottom already,
I know things are going to move one way or the other before the options
expiry next week. And since the Max Pain for the index options are at
least 10% higher, I am still looking for a reversal soon.</p>
<p>I mentally noted S&amp;P at 845 is an important level. It was the low of the
10/28 big rally day. The market skid on the 845 level all morning with
little volume. That was good because it is testing a support on low
volume. I had thought we may bounce from there.</p>
<p>Then I went to lunch just before noon.</p>
<p>When I got back after 1pm, the market has already broken down. However,
there are several bullish indication I noticed.</p>
<ol>
<li>the break down volume is higher than the previous bar (Figure 1),
    but it's still relatively low. Which means we don't have panic
    selling yet.</li>
<li>both the TICK and Advance-Decline line moving averages (Figure 2)
    are relatively healthy for such an important drop. Indicating no
    broad selling.</li>
<li>notice the unusual V shape for the TICK (Figure 2)? We even reached
    a new multi-day low of -1666. Yet #1 and #2 contradicts this
    seemingly panic selling, so this depression in price looked
    artificial to me</li>
</ol>
<p>Like how the recent rally attempts lacked enthusiasm, this break of 845
and test of 820 looked like it lacked enthusiasm too. Given that this is
such a major support level, odds are that we will bounce from here at
least for intraday. That is when I made my entry.</p>
<p></p>
Before 2pm, we broke 850, the low of yesterday, with the highest 30 min
volume of the week. That is when the rally looked strong to me and my
doubt of a bull trap eased. Frankly, I had some tight mental stops and
prepared to jump if things deteriorate like the many times before.</p>
<p>The day continued strong with price and volume confirmation. We closed
at the high with significant volume. We even reached 700 million volume
on SPY, a first since 10/16. I believe an intermediate bottom has been
set so I'll be looking at a longer timeframe (days) for my long
positions now.</p>
<p>First expected resistance from this move is 980 on the S&amp;P from the
trendline (Figure 1, right). Target is at least the 50 dma, we just
haven't touched it for 2 months. This is as good a time as ever to give
it a run for it.</p>
<p>Today is a great example of the need for critical thinking with a clear
head in light of a lot of pressure and past emotion. The beaten account,
the grim market movement, and the many stopped out trades has nearly
made me walk away for the week. But I remained focus on the market and
made my decision based on the price action.</p>
<p>Despite renewed optimism, I will continue to practice <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">prudent risk
management</a> and to eventually pocket at least most of the profit from
today, if not more.</p>
