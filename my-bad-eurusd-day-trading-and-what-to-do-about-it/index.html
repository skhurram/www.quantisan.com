    </h1>

    <div class='article-content'>
        <p>I've stayed home from work this week because of the flu. So with spare
time on my hands, I had the urge to experiment with day trading the
forex market. Bad decision. After a good 3-4 days of day trading EUR/USD
with my demo account, here is what I have to show as illustrated in my
account balance graph for the past 4 trading sessions below.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Account balance
Nov 10-14, 2009"][<img alt="Account balance Nov 10-14, 2009" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-14-account_balance.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-14-account_balance.png">Account balance
Nov 10-14, 2009</a>[/caption] Yes, you can push back up your dropped jaw
now. I considered not accounting for these losses in my paper trading
account because these trades were meant to be experimental only.
However, as the whole point of me paper trading the forex is to learn
and improve, I decided to keep these losses and suffer the consequences
of my own doing. Heck, I wouldn't have had the choice if this were real
money (which is the way that I should treat this demo account anyway). I
stepped out of my circle of strength (swing trading) into something that
has burned me many times before. Well guess what, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/1000-in-2-days/">history does repeat
itself</a>. Enough with lambasting myself. The real focus of this post is
to point out what I did wrong and what can I do to improve in day
trading the forex. Not that I'm intent on day trading though. This is
merely to increase my arsenal in forex trading. Figuring out what I did
wrong is actually obvious in hindsight. Figure 2 below depicts the
trades I made on Nov 13, which led to most of that steady decline in my
account balance as shown in Fig. 1. See the bounce from about 1.4820? I
kept shorting it and shorting it all the way up to 1.4880. What was I
thinking? The main reason for this epic failure is that I broke a
fundamental rule in trading. <strong>Trade what you see and what you thought</strong>
(Techniques of Tape Reading by <a href="http://www.realitytrader.com/blog/">V. Graifer</a>). Based on the previous
day's market sell-off from 1.5000 and the Asian markets failing to break
1.4900, I thought the market would follow through on Friday and break
through this 1.4820 support. In particular, just before NY open before
9:30am, EUR/USD had a couple of big drops, as shown in Fig. 2. All these
circumstances led to my believe that we'll see a weak day like
yesterday.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EUR/USD,
5m"][<img alt="EUR/USD, 5m" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_5m.PNG" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_5m.PNG">EUR/USD, 5m</a>[/caption] However, a support is
still a support until it's broken. I shouldn't keep shorting it even
though it has obviously bounced. While identifying the trend is trivial
in hindsight, what evidence did I have at the time to tell me that? The
evidence was in fact staring me in the face that morning. Figure 3 shows
part of the screen that I usually use for intra-day observation. As you
can see, S&amp;P500 rejected the previous day's close with a strong negative
TICK reading and then broke above the morning range. The TICK also
remained strong with many +800 readings in the morning. All the classic
signs that point to a strong positive trend.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="577" caption="intraday
sentiment"]<img alt="intraday sentiment" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-intraday_am.PNG" />[/caption] Furthermore, if only I had
stepped back and observed the bigger picture, as shown in Fig. 4 with a
30-minute chart, I would have seen that we have a great positive
divergence swing setup (and which I normally would have exploited if I
weren't so focused on trading the 5m that day).</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EUR/USD,
30-minute"][<img alt="EUR/USD, 30-minute" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_30m.PNG" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_30m.PNG">EUR/USD, 30-minute</a>[/caption] What
is my goal in future day trading? Instead of a declining equity curve as
in Figure 1, just flip it up-side-down and that's what would be perfect.
All I needed to change is being able to spot the right trend and ride
it. Easier said than done. So what is the moral of this story? I have
once again proven that I am still no good at day trading. Stick with
swing trades.</p>
