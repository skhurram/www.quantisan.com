            <div class="article-content"> <p>While I haven't written about my stance on the flood of bailouts, I have
been against it all along. Pouring tax payers' <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122540927284586151.html">money into a select few
elites</a> in the name of <em>helping</em> the economy has sank my respect for
the American government to a new low. This is just like the Bush's
Weapons of Mass Destruction lies and the subsequent Iraq invasion all
over again, only on an epic scale and the effect much more encompassing.
However, the situation have reached a new low. In today's news, there's
talk of banks asking for credit card debt forgiveness. They might as
well just hand out each American a million dollar cheque. Then watch the
American dollar become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar">Zimbobwe money</a> and plunge America back to the
Medieval era when people would barter for their goods. The sheer
stupidity of this move is below even that of Bush's intelligence! If
what the U.S.A. is doing lately isn't socialism, then I don't know what
is. That is one huge factor why I've been long gold and silver with my
accumulating position in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">SLW</a>. It looks as though we might be in for
a continued downtrend in precious metal prices. But sooner or later,
prices will reflect their true values. Update: The Big Picture made a
post about <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/10/moral-hazard-of.html">mortgage bailouts</a> today on the same issue. Barry puts the
issue of bailing out bad debts succinctly, "moral hazard not only
encourages recklessness, it leads to people looking to avoid
responsibility for bad decisions."</p> </div>

<p>Wrote some puts on Dec08 of SLW at 7.5 strike price. Fee \$7.5.</p>
<p>Upside: Volume on the rally from the low has been consistently high.
Price of silver looks as though it has seen the low for now. Note the
volume graph on 15-min YI price, the retest of last Friday's high
occurred at lower volume, marked by yellow line.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$4 first, then primary at \$5. Next up is \$9 - \$10.</p>
<p>Downside: Week prior to election, rally not supported by volume on
overall market. Earnings report on Monday. Commodities under pressure.</p>
<p>Support: \$3.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: Can't say for sure if we're at the bottom yet. The
sentiment is definitely turning. By now til late December, SLW and the
overall market should make a sizable rally. I will unload this then.</p>
<p>Stop: If on expirary I'm being <em>put to</em>, then I might just pony up the
cash and buy the shares. Effective share price will be \$3.5.</p>

<p>The volatile market these days... it's just difficult to comprehend.
Until now!</p>
<p>
From [Financial Times][],

> VWÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s share price rose 82 per cent to
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬945 following MondayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 147 per cent
> jump, leaving it with a market capitalisation of about
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬287bn (\$370bn), making it the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s
> second-largest company ahead of Wal-Mart, General Electric and
> Microsoft.

To put this into perspective, at the low on Friday, VW's market
capitalization is about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬60 billion. By the high of
Tuesday, VW is worth almost 5 times that on paper! The epic scale of the
money flow is just mindboggling. I think they should change their symbol
from VOW to WOW!

</p>

<p>Porsche today offers to sell <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9c3098dc-a593-11dd-9d26-000077b07658.html">5% of its VW shares</a> to ease the buying
pressure.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a well known observation. <strong>In a bull market, shares
rise slow and tank like a tombstone. In a bear market, shares fall slow
and rocket up the sky.</strong></p>
<p>As I've said a few times, we are <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-capitulation-under-way/">making history these days</a>. And if
this current rally do follow through, this could very well be the
"event" noted in history book which people will mark at the bottom of
the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>While the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122518913601675675.html">market is sorting things out today</a>, I'd like to document a
simple stock price predictor based on put/call activity called Option
Pain or Max Pain.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that professional traders favour writing options.
Since trading options is a zero-sum game, it is in their best interest
if a majority of options expire worthless on expiration day.</p>
<p>By observing the open interest of a stock at each strike price, we can
see at what price the Option Pain would occur. Of course, this is just
another tool for the trader to use, so do your own due diligence as
usual when trading.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Using this chart from <a href="http://www.optionpain.com/MaxPain/Max-Pain.php">Option Pain</a>, we can see that the minimum
option total value of November SLW is at \$5. So our max pain price is
at \$5 for November's SLW. That is to say, if SLW settles at \$5, then
the most call option would expire worthless and most of the put option
would expire worthless. Such that the option sellers (the pros) can
pocket your money.</p>
<p>Another way to use this information is to find the best Max Pain to
Current Price ratio among a list of stocks. For example, SLW closed at
\$2.59 yesterday. Its max pain is \$5 from the chart above. That is
almost a double. Note, however, that we haven't figured out the
probability of SLW reaching \$5. This would be something for me to look
into.</p>
<p>In comparison, GOOG's max pain for November is at \$360. Its previous
closing price is 329.49. Based on these numbers, SLW is a better buy
than GOOG for now.</p>

<p>I decided to look at the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-capitulation-under-way/">20-year monthly chart once again</a>. After all
said and done in this crazy October, look where we are now. Right back
to where we were, before the credit crunch, the housing bubble, the iraq
invasion, 9/11, the tech bubble, and the 1998 bear. Just look at the
trend line extrapolated from 1994 drawn above. Isn't it amazing!</p>
<p>On Saturday, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-volatile-week-and-no-sign-of-the-bull-yet/">I questioned our direction for next week</a> and noted its
significance. Looking at this chart, if we go down next week, then this
will very much be a new leg of a downtrend because of its significance.
We haven't broken this trendline in ... 14 years! <em>If</em> we do break this
supporting line, then I wouldn't be surprised if we go all the way down
to 650 on the S&amp;P, the 1995 congestion zone.</p>
<p>As of this writing on Sunday night, the morning Asian market looks
directionless at the open, Nikkei +0.4%, Hang Seng -1.6%.</p>
<p>I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/20-year-sp-500-trendline-actually-broken-months-ago/">review this chart again</a> this weekend when it's end of the
month.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Over the weekend, I've dug into a few more automated trading development
platforms. There are certainly <a href="http://www.elitetrader.com/so/">many out there</a>. This condensed
comparison is based on my own experience, online research, or reading
through their documentation. I only included the ones which I find to be
the best for each different level of <strong>independent</strong> developers. We'll
start with the most basic and work our way up the food chain.</p>
<h4>TradeStation</h4>
<p>Pros: Easy to learn and implement. Large Community.

problem</a>.</p>
<p>Who I think it's for: Medium to high programming background. Low cost
(free to develop or \$50/month for trading), good for independent
developer that has a long development time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ninjatrader.com">www.ninjatrader.com</a></p>
<h4>OpenQuant</h4>

lacking.</p>

<h4>Alphacet</h4>
<p>Pros: Latest and greatest. Codeless development capability. Faster
concept to deployment time.</p>
