            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been weaning myself away from Microsoft products these past few
years. First to go was Microsoft Outlook. Then Microsoft Office. And
then recently, I am finally rid myself of the last Microsoft product
that I have--Windows XP. I have been using Ubuntu for the past two
months now. Linux is certainly a lot easier to use now than years ago
when Red Hat was the most popular distribution. I installed Ubuntu and
the system was ready to use. No more hunting for linux drivers or
installing packages one by one. Ubuntu was ready for use right off the
bat. The first couple of weeks was awkward as there are many differences
between Ubuntu and Windows. I often find myself searching online to see
how to perform some trivial tasks. Setting up the Ubuntu system to just
the way I wanted took some time and IT skills. But after the initial
learning curve of about a week, I am very satisfied. Both Windows and
Ubuntu have their pros and cons (there are plenty of comparisons online,
so I won't compare them here), I wouldn't say one is better than other.
As a skilled computer user, I am fine either way. The primary use of my
computer is for running my automated strategies and quant programming.
As such, system stability is a top priority for me. Which is why I
decided to try Linux in the first place. So far, Ubuntu hs lived up to
its expectations. I ran the JForex platform non-stop for days in
addition to my regular heavy usage without any hiccup or slowdown.
Having made the switch, I will be sticking with Ubuntu for the following
reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It works.</li>
<li>It is stable.</li>
<li>It is free.</li>
<li>It is fully customizable.</li>
<li>It integrates with other open source software that I use.</li>
<li>I like how it is always up-to-date to fix bugs and security holes.</li>
<li>It runs much better than XP (although that's an unfair comparison as
    XP is old).</li>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm long Ventana Gold Corp. (VEN.TO), a junior gold mining company.
Here's a look at gold (Figure 1) and the junior gold mining company
index (GDXJ, Figure 2).</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"
caption="Gold"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-15-Gold.png" />][][/caption] [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

<p>Both figures are from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/finviz/">Finviz</a>.</p>
<p>The reason why I picked VEN in particular is related to this article in
June. Ventana Gold raises \$20 million in private placement. Silver
Wheaton (SLW) paid \$20 million for shares priced at \$11.11 per share
back in June. SLW is a well managed company in the precious metal
industry. I've traded it before and it has always been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">on my radar to
buy</a>.</p>
<p>VEN has been taking a heavy beating in the past few weeks since SLW's
investment as shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Ventana Gold
Corp. (VEN.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-15-VEN.TO.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-15-VEN.TO.png">2</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>\$6.80 is the 50% retracement level to that recent rally (the first
since the dive beginning in June). It seems to be holding well today
despite market weakness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, EUR/USD rocketed upward and is trading around 1.29. This
isn't something to be ignored.</p>
<p>So I'm taking a small bet here at \$6.93. Stop loss order is opened at
\$6.40. My risk is thus, (\$6.93 - \$6.40) * 250 = \$132.50 + \$9.90
commission = \$142.40 = 1.5% of account.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update at Noon: Looks like I am wrong. LLL.TO is testing its recent high
at \$40.50. However, volume is rather low up to now. I'm out my
Lululemon (LLL.TO) position because of market softness. Bonds (TLT) are
holding a support level. EUR/USD is struggling to hold above 1.27. And
the oversea markets (Asia and Europe) are weak overnight. Perhaps the
market is getting ready to catapult up. Perhaps it is not. But I'm not
going to place my bet on anything as I don't have a clue where it's
about to go at the moment. So I am stopping out of this position at
breakeven. Preserving capital. Moreover, recent price move in Lululemon
(LULU on Nasdaq) is disappointing. Despite the market marking new
consecutive highs for the past few days, LLL is stuck in a rut as shown
in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Purchase price of these shares were <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-140-lll-to-39-86/">\$39.86 from a week ago</a>.</p>
<p>Exact return is (\$40 - \$39.86) * 140 = \$19.60 - \$9.90 commission =
\$9.70. In any case, I'm all cash in my account now. At least I've free
myself from the market for the next two weeks during my trip to Hong
Kong. Here's an updated view of the daily chart of LLL.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Java is the programming language that I have known and used the longest.
I learned Java as part of the curriculum when I was in my first year of
undergraduate study. Although reluctant at first, I can still recall the
joy I felt switching over from C++. No more garbage collection! That was
ten years ago. I haven't done any real programming in the last few years
as my engineering work has become higher and higher level. Although I
have maintained my hobby in developing automated trading strategies and
quantitative analysis, much of that work are mere child's play compared
to what I have done and much forgotten. Lately, words such as "<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/from-object-oriented-programming-to-object-oriented-design/">code
smell</a>", "design pattern", and the likes are creeping back into my
world as I am <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-to-lose-focus-by-defining-what-i-want-from-trading/">comitting myself</a> to pursuit my esoteric fascination in
financial engineering. The first step, research, was a few months of
testing the possibilities to decide what I should use. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">Different
markets</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">different brokers</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/comparing-trading-api-from-6-online-forex-brokerages/">different platforms</a>, and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">different technology</a>. I decided to study the foreign exchange market
through <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy's JForex platform</a> using Java. Although ideally, I
would be using Oanda and Python... But I'm not prepared to cough out
\$600 per month for Oanda's API. Some of the other tools that I use are
<a href="http://rapid-i.com">RapidMiner</a> and <a href="http://weka.wikispaces.com/">Weka</a>. Both of which offer a Java API. Having
learned JForex and programmed a few strategies already, I have tested
the water enough. For the past few weeks, I have been taking steps to
move to the next level of my development. However, as I play with
programming more and more, I realize that I am fundamentally outdated in
my programming skills. There were no <em>interface</em> when I learned Java.
Neither was there <em>hashset</em> and <em>annotation</em>. As such, before doing
anything else, I am just going to pause for the next two weeks while I
am travelling in Hong Kong and catch up on my Java knowledge (I just
realized that they don't publish those Teach Yourself \&lt;insert topic>
in 24 Hours book anymore. The Head First series seem to be the craze
nowadays). My goal is to devour a Java book in the 15-hour flight. Let's
see if I still got it after ten years.</p> </div>
