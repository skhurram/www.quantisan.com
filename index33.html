            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>RRSP contribution deadline on March 1st is fast approaching. Like most
Canadians, this is pretty much the only time when I give my<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_Retirement_Savings_Plan">Registered
Retirement Savings Plan</a> some attention. Right now, my RRSP balance
stands at \$0. That's right, nothing. I've been putting my money at work
for 10 years trading all sorts of markets but willfully ignoring the
biggest cost to any trader. Taxes. Now that my marginal tax rate is for
the first time running above 30%, and with no tax break in sight, it's
time that I take a hard look at my tax strategies to reduce my trading
costs. Don't worry, this isn't yet another post about RRSP. (But if
you're indeed looking for RRSP information, I point you to a Canadian
personal finance blog, <a href="http://www.milliondollarjourney.com/">MillionDollarJourney</a>) The reason why I
haven't placed money into my RRSP is same as why I don't invest in real
estates. Which is, a lack of liquidity. As the name suggest, RRSP is for
retirement. Here's the problem simplistically put. If I take money out
while I'm still working, I get taxed at my full marginal tax rate for
those money. Even if they were supposed to be capital gain. Thus I
effectively lose my 50% tax discount from my investment capital gain. So
money into my RRSP would effectively be locked in while my salary is
still my main source of income! I don't have a wad of cash where I can
just stash away yet. So that's why my RRSP stands at \$0 this year.
Although I am thinking of opening an RRSP soon... But I digressed. The
fact is, taxes in Canada is ridiculously high. So I need to do something
about it soon. While looking for RRSP information, I came across
Questrade's Tax Free Trading Account. It is a reincarnation of the <a href="http://www.tfsa.gc.ca/">Tax
Free Savings Account</a>. As far as I know, Questrade is the only
discount broker offering this type of account. Basically, it is a
trading account in which there is no income taxes involved and any
profit taken out would not count towards annual income too. Sounds too
good to be true? Here are 3 limitations for a TFSA trading account.</p>
<ol>
<li>Limit of \$5,000 contribution per year</li>
<li>Extra costs for trading the U.S. markets</li>
<li>Cash account only, no margin.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will discuss #2 shortly. But #3 is what matters the most to me as a
trader. No margin means no leverage, no shorting, and no futures and
forex trading. No shorting?! One-way trading is not a good thing for a
trader. This is obviously a ploy to get people to buy, buy, buy. And no
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex trading</a>?! Yet, I can't expect to have my cake and eat it too.
Yes, this TFSA trading thing has strings attached. But. It's tax-free!
That's enough incentive for me to consider incorporating it into my
portfolio. Make no mistake, this will not be my primary, or even
secondary, trading account. My plan is to use it as an
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ultra-conservative</span>
investment vehicle only. It's about time that I replace my abysmal 1%
yield savings account! Before<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade">opening a Questrade TFSA trading
account</a> (affliate link) though, I need to do my homework on Canadian
stocks. Because TFSA is a Canadian government offer, trading U.S.
markets would incur extra costs (a devious way of "Buy Canadian"). As
such, the only cost effective way for me to maximize a TFSA trading
account is to trade TSX and TSX Ventures stocks. This is yet another
item on my to-do list. Come up with a strategy to trade this account
<strong>with minimal risks</strong> (can't stress this enough)using Canadian stocks.
I actually have some ideas already. But I'll save that for another time.
In my next series of posts, I ask a fundamental investment question like
any trader should. Is a \$5000 Questrade TFSA trading account cost
effective? P.S. For more information on Questrade, youngandthrifty.ca
offers a <a href="http://youngandthrifty.ca/questrade-review-2/">review of this discount broker</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I entered CADJPY long at market for 86.88 just now. This is a
continuation of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-usdcad-short-1-0540-for-131-pips/">previous USDCAD short</a> position. However, USDJPY
is on a run upward so I'm switching to go long on the loonie with yen
instead. Figure 1 shows the daily chart of CADJPY. Notice the imminent
MACD bullish crossover and the already in-play stochastic upturn. I like
it. My stop loss level is set at 86.10. It's the high of a previous peak
on February 3, two weeks ago. My target is the round number 88
resistance. 88.0 has been an important price level for CADJPY for the
past few months. So I'm setting my sight there.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="CADJPY,
daily"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-02-17-cadjpy_d.gif" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows my timing for this entry. CADJPY is noticeably meeting
some resistance at 87.50. 87.50 is also the 61.8% Fibonacci level of a
recent down move. This is a cause for concern on my long position as we
could very well retrace here. However, the bullishness of CADJPY is
apparent in Figure 2. Prices have consistently been bought for the past
few days right on the short term moving average (teal line).
Furthermore, the intermediate term moving average (orange line) is about
to cross the long term moving average (red line) as I enter this
position.</p>
<p>Lastly, gold price has taken a dive from 1130 to 1100. Meanwhile, crude
oil price is holding the 77 support nicely. Thus, this confirm my
previous view that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-change-of-wind-for-australian-dollar-shorted-audusd-0-9183-and-audcad-0-9546/">oil has better upside than gold</a> in the
intermediate term. Which is why I've been trading the loonie these past
weeks.</p>
<p>For this particular CADJPY trade, I have another buy order waiting above
current support level to add to my long position. Let's see if CADJPY
can break decisively to the upside in the next 24 hours as US and
Canadian data comes out.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>It seems to me that the popular trading blogs have one thing in common.
They all make some form of forecasts about the market, or even better,
calling out to a particular stock or currency pair. My guess is that
there's a lot more people looking for trading ideas for quick profits
than actually interested in the mundane mechanics of trading. Well, that
and because of the fact that some of these blogs are written by
respectable professionals that do provide good insights (my
recommendations are linked to in my blogroll, near bottom of the sidebar
to the right). I used to publish my predictions on the market on a
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/weekly-review/">frequent basis</a>. It was my way of taking notes and keeping record for
the week or month. Ever since my embarrassing, and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-errors-lessons-being-long-just-before-the-october-2008-crash/">costly</a>, attempt
to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-sign-this-financial-bloodbath-is-ending-soon/">call for the bottom in October 2008,</a> I have learned to keep my
views to myself for the following reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>I suck at forecasting, terribly.</li>
<li>I wouldn't want anyone to trade on my guesses.</li>
<li>There are plenty of other, much wiser, traders posting their views
    online.</li>
<li>I changed my strategy by trading on reactions and not predictions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point #4 is what I'd like to discuss in this post. The main problem I
have with making forecasts is that I get stuck to one perspective. Say
if after a weekend analyzing session, I conclude that the market is up
for next week. I would keep looking for opportunities to go long in the
market the following week. That works well if I am right. Yet, as I
always say, I am wrong just as often as anyone. So the chance of success
is at best 50-50. On an equal chance that if I am wrong. I lose not once
but twice. First from being in the wrong side of the price move. Second
from missing that opposite and correct move. As such, I have since
adapted to a reactive <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy</a> rather than a predictive one.
Essentially, I analyze the markets to come up with conditions for
different scenarios (usually just three cases: up, down, and no idea)
that will play out. For example, if <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-gbpjpy-145-24-stop-144-70-target-148/">GBP/JPY is above 144.50, I go
long</a>. One of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">trading skills</a> I am still struggling to execute
consistently is to be deliberately one step slower than most people on
entering a trade. Being reactive is simplistically being a step slower
than everyone to ride an obvious setup. It goes like this ideally. When
the writings are on the wall and more aggressive traders have taken
their position, I wait even more. Then once those trades are still left
standing (i.e. not stopped out), that's when I would strike. On the
other hand, if the signs are not clear as crystal, I need to have the
discipline to step to the sideline. This strategy has been very useful
to me as I have recorded some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">good trades</a> because of it. My ideal
strategy certainly is less glamourous than a buy low, sell high motto.
Yet, having been through a few too many ups and downs in my account over
the years, I have learned to appreciate the art of not gunning for every
penny out there but aiming to keep every penny in my pocket. Much like
how you would survive in a battle, the secret is to not be the first one
out the line and then only go for the easy kills. Cowardly, yes. But
unlike war, being brave in trading does not earn you any medal.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Finally a profitable trade in my USDCAD short after being stopped out a
few times. My decision last week to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-short-target-hit-1-0581-trying-something-new-to-hold-for-longer/">hold this for longer</a> after
USDCAD touched my target paid off. I moved my stop closer last Thursday
evening and the order got filled on Friday. However, as I type this on
the following Monday, USDCAD is trading even lower at 1.0478. It looks
as though my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">original target of 1.0415</a> is in the cards. Even though
this is a profitable trade with a 0.17% gain in my demo account, there
is one major flaw with this short USDCAD play. I was not able to squeeze
more out of this profitable move. As I've said, this short took a few
tries. In fact, if we consider all the entires and exits of this play.
My stopped out losses totaled 0.29% and my single win here is merely
0.17%. So I'm actually at a net loss of 0.12% from all these work. My
win/loss rate is about 40% based on my review of recent forex trades. I
was able to edge out more than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">10% profit in four months</a> because
when I am wrong, I take small steps. But when I'm right, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">pile into a
position</a>. Ever since my trading environment has changed, I've been
trying to trade a longer timeframe. This USDCAD short is my first
attempt on a new strategy. Evidently, I will need to re-think and
re-learn what I've become accustomed to in the past few months. One of
the necessary trait of a successful trader is to be able to adapt.
Markets change. Traders need to evolve with the markets or they will
become obsolete. This will be a good test of myself to see if I can
re-invent myself to adapt to a changing trading environment. [caption

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Once upon a time, I was a happy forex student. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper traded</a> on
Oanda for a few months and even opened a live account with them. Then my
work place tightened up our internet firewall at work. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-to-do-when-life-gets-in-your-way-of-trading/">couldn't
access market data anymore</a> during the day. Fortunately, Dukascopy at
the time said that they'll be <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">enabling micro-lot trading</a>. So I moved
to practice with Dukascopy. Then last weekend, Dukascopy said <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/no-micro-lot-trading-at-dukascopy-metatrader-4-accounts/">no
micro-lot trading on their Metatrader 4 accounts</a>. I move to another
broker again. My last stop (so far) is at MB Trading. However, after
practicing with them for a week, I remembered why I didn't go with them
in the first place. They don't offer Canadian denominated account
currency! Fortunately, they do say that they're in the process of
enabling more account currencies. But who knows how long that might
take? My head is spinning from all this mess. I don't think I am asking
too much from a forex broker. I just want five features from them.</p>
<ol>
<li>good reputation</li>
<li>micro-lot trading</li>
<li>Metatrader platform</li>
<li>free API access</li>
<li>Canadian dollar denominated account currency</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all! Why am I being shut out everytime just when I am about to
open a live account? On top of that trouble, there's the question of
which trading platform to use. Over the past few months, I have tried
many forex brokers and their forex trading platforms. From proprietary
ones like FXTrade (Oanda), JForex (Dukascopy), and Dealbook 360 (GFT) to
the popular, third-party Metatrader 4 platform. I decided to settle with
Metatrader 4 because its charting is sufficient and scripting on it is
fairly easy. I learned MQL4 (MT4's scripting language) in a few hours
and wrote my first EA in a few days. The problem with Metatrader 4
though, is Metatrader 5. Scripts written for MT4 is incompatible on MT5.
As I intend to trade semi-automatically via expert advisors, this is a
huge problem for me. I don't want to start developing for MT4 and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">only
to have to convert everything again</a>. I thought I could evade this
MT4-MT5 dilemma with a non-American forex broker (<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143">Dukascopy</a>) as
they're more likely to stay with MT4. But now that I can't trade with
them anymore, my best potential broker is MB Trading. Which is probably
upgrading to MT5 once it's out. Note: MT5 is built for new NFA
regulations, so American brokers probably have to upgrade. I think I
have had enough moves for now. So screw this all! I will focus on
learning Python programming for the next few weeks. While waiting for MB
Trading to adopt Canadian dollar accounts (or I come across a new
broker), and the duel between Metatrader 4 and 5 is settled.</p>

<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="USDCAD,
4-hour"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-02-10-usdcad_4h.gif" />][][/caption] In fact, I intend to look for opportunities
to add to this position. As long as USDCAD stays below 1.0645, I'm
confident (not exactly the right word though) with this down move. From
this point onward, it's new territory for me as I push beyond my comfort
zone. Is this an ill-fated move or a spark of insight? Let me know what
you think about this extended trade. Update February 15: I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-usdcad-short-1-0540-for-131-pips/">closed this
trade</a> for +131 pips gain.</p>
