            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Much has been written about when to buy stocks, forex, or other
instruments. In fact, it is the topic that is written the most about in
trading. As if there's nothing else to trading than timing your entries.
On the contrary, I have come to realize that timing for entries is
actually the least important aspect of a trade (see a real world prove
below). Nevertheless, it is still a factor for consideration in a
complete trading strategy. As such, this post is about the 4 fundamental
entry signs that I use to enter in any trade. No matter which trading
setup I am using, I only place my order because one or more of these
conditions are met. To make sure that everyone is on the same page. Let
me define what exactly I am talking about here. I define the act of
timing for an entry as the process for deciding <strong>where or when to place
an order</strong> after a signal has been flagged by a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setup</a>. In
particular, it would be step #8 according to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC setup</a>. For
example, if the conditions to buy USDCAD are met on the daily chart,
then I will zoom in on to the 3-hour timeframe to spot a confirmation of
the move. Once that is also satisfied, I zoom in even more to the
30-minute chart to spot when (if market order) or where (if limit order)
to place the order. Figuring out exactly when and where to place your
bet is a topic for much discussion, even when you know that you want to
buy it somewhere around this level. The better the price, the better
your reward/risk will be. Wait too long, and the market could leave you
behind. Long story short, when it comes down to it, there are simply 4
fundamental entry signs for buying in any market that I use. I only buy
at/when the price is:</p>
<ol>
<li>at a support area</li>
<li>at a Fibonacci retracement level</li>
<li>at oversold conditions</li>
<li>showing accumulation by large players</li>
</ol>
<p>(and vice versa for shorting a market) These are necessary, but not
sufficient entry conditions. One or more of these conditions must be met
for all trades. But satisfying these conditions would not guarantee
profitability. I know I've repeated this many times now, but I can't
stress this enough. This is just <strong>one small step</strong> of a thorough
analytical process in deciding your trade. Don't go around buying
everything on support levels or when RSI goes over 80. The reason why I
find it necessary to write about something so trivial now is that I have
just been caught trying to catch a top again. Take a look at the figure
below illustrating my trade orders trying to catch a USD/CAD short-term
top. My trading setup flagged for a short USDCAD trade. So I gave it a
few tries. Eight times. Eight! If only I had remembered my 4 fundamental
entry signs, I wouldn't have tried to short this pair all over the place
and getting stopped out again and again. If I adhered to these 4 signs,
I would have only tried it a couple of times at 1.0480 resistance and
then let it pass once the condition is violated. On the other hand, as I
was saying earlier that the entry is the least important aspect of a
trade. I came out of this mess as illustrated unscathed. I managed to
exit all of my entries at break-even, or at least close to it. So even
failing 8 entries, my account balance barely budged. Recall I said
timing for entries is the least important part of trading? Well, this is
a good example of it. You could mess up your entries, 8 times, and still
come out ok. You probably know this already, but I'll say this for the
sake of thoroughness. By far the most important aspect of a profitable
trading strategy is prudent <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>. That is what saved me
in this embarrassing shorting USD/CAD example.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This month has been a roller coaster in both the markets and my account
balance (see Figure 1). Here's a quick recap of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trades</a> in
the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex markets</a> for November. I started out by cashing the carried
over long yen and dollar positions from October. Those trades could have
been better as I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-good-trade-that-could-have-been-great-a-lesson-to-take-profit-at-target/">lamented in a post</a>. Nevertheless, it was a
good start for the month. Then, things went downhill for me; literally,
as you can see from my account balance at the first half of the month in
Figure 1. I tried my luck <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-bad-eurusd-day-trading-and-what-to-do-about-it/">day trading EUR/USD with horrible results</a>.
I marked this particular period of drawdown from these EUR/USD day
trades on Figure 1 with a red band. The fear lingered on and I gave up
all the initial gain of the month to scrap just below the opening
balance. Fortunately, I was able to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-example-of-how-trading-in-fear-is-bad-for-your-account/">realize my problem</a> and clean up
my act. I recuperated by documenting <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-0122-sl-1-0060-tp-1-0225/">each</a> <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-audjpy-81-22-sl-80-99-tp-82-50/">of my</a> <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-out-audjpy-longs-81-3-7-pips-and-81-29-28-pips/">entry</a> like I
used to to force myself to think more and trade less. The turnaround
didn't happen immediately. Not until I became even more stringent on
myself and stuck with using only my best setup, the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC setup</a>. I
marked this period on Figure 1 with the green bar and arrow. As you can
see, I happened to be in the right markets and at the right times to
make a full recovery back to the top. In fact, I made <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/audjpy-short-81-3777-17-anatomy-of-my-first-400-pips-trade/">my first 400+
pips trade</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/eurusd-95-pips-in-2-hours-an-example-of-swing-and-day-trade-convergence/">my best EUR/USD day trade</a> during this comeback. I
thought I could finish the month above the critical \$5500 level (10%
gain). But a couple small losers on the last day pulled my account below
it yet again. However, one lesson I became even more aware of from the
draw-down is to forget about your account balance. Focus on making good
trades, manage your risks, and the money will take care of itself.

<h2>Performance Statistics</h2>
<p>Attached below are my performance statistics for November. The first
number is this month's and the second number in bracket is from October
for comparison. I will highlight and comment on the few discrepancies
that I find important. Sarting Fund \$5,089.06 End of Month Fund
\$5,302.21 Total Net Profit \$166.90 (\$213.15) Gross Profit \$598
(\$499) Gross Loss -\$431 (-\$285) Profit Factor 1.39 (1.75) Net Profit
% 3.15% (4.19%) Max. Drawdown % <strong>3.44%</strong> (2.32%) This draw-down is
horrible to say the least. Kurtosis <strong>3.45</strong> (8.53) Skewness <strong>1.54</strong>
(2.49) Sharpe Ratio <strong>16.64</strong> (5.21) The kurtosis and skewness are
surprisingly good. A low, but not near-zero numbers are preferable. The
Sharpe ratio is also surprisingly good too. This isn't because my return
is good, is just that the standard deviation return of my trades have
been very consistent. Ironically, that's mostly because of steady small
losses (see Figure 1). 95th Percentile P&amp;L \$23.20 (\$70.11) 5th
Percentile P&amp;L -\$10.31 (-\$33.60) Net Profit Mid 90% Only <strong>\$33.82</strong>
(\$46.34) I failed to meet <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/october-2009-trading-performance-review/">my goal from last month</a> to increase my
mid-90% return. It would have been easily met if I didn't go crazy with
the day trades and loose a bundle. Total # of Trades <strong>153</strong> (34)
Percent Profitable 47.06% (44.12%) # of Winning Trades 72 (15) # of
Losing Trades 81 (19) I started to make use of scaling in and out of a
trade. So sometimes one trade would be counted as 2 or 3 small ones.
Still, I made too many trades this month. Even if I consider a 2 for 1
ratio of trades (i.e. 153 / 2 = 76), it is still more than twice as many
as last month. My net profit is lower too. Wasted time and effort for
lower return. <strong>Lesson for the month is clearly to think more and trade
less</strong>. Average Trade Profit % 0.02% (0.12%) Average Winning % <strong>0.16</strong>%
( 0.66%) Average Losing % <strong>-0.10</strong>% (-0.30%) Ratio Win% / Loss% 1.57
(2.21) This could be the most worrisome statistics for me this month. My
average winning percentage from a trade is significantly less. <strong>I need
to be more aggressive when I am right to reap the most reward from it</strong>.
Stash in the cash as the position gets greener! Max. Conseq. Winners 12
(4) Max. Conseq. Losers 14 (6) Largest Winning Trade \$41.88 (\$171.79)
Largest Losing Trade -\$20.34 (-\$44.17) Avg. Time Held [hrs] 0.56
(2.18)</p>
<h2>Goal for Next Month</h2>
<p>Let's start by saying what I did well this month. I think my comeback
was phenomenal, but definitely with luck on my side. I approached my
huge draw-down systematically and rationally by reducing position size,
trading less, and restricted myself by using my best <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setup</a>
only. Then when the time was right, I was able to pound on the winning
positions. I will need to remember this the next time I'm experiencing a
draw-down (hopefully not as much as this month's). On the other hand, I
made many trading mistakes this month. Most were just short-term
problems and I have already written about them in my lessons. Upon
further review of my performance this month, two major problems are
evident as discussed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Think more and trade less. Limit my trades to approximately one a
    day and know when to NOT trade at all. Not even with tiny positions
    to "test the water" as I like to do.</li>
<li>Be more aggressive when the position is right. Achieve this by
    improving on my scaling in and out strategy by accelerating the
    scaling in and decelerating on the scaling out.</li>
</ol>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I had my best day-trading day this quarter on November 27. I made 95
pips in two hours at the open with only two trades. This post is a
review of my trades that day for my future reference. To save you and
myself from reading, the two reasons for this good run are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convergence of intermediate term signals with day trading signals</li>
<li>Ignoring my bearish sentiment (Dubai news) and traded what I saw
    from the prices</li>
</ol>
<p>Before moving on, let's start by setting the stage with some background
information to summarize what conditions were like that day.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The news on November 25 after NY close of <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-and-yen-buoyed-by-safe-haven-flows-2009-11-27">Dubai World delaying their
debt repayments</a> sent the dollar and yen soaring. I made <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/audjpy-short-81-3777-17-anatomy-of-my-first-400-pips-trade/">my first
400+ pips trade</a> by being at the right place and time on this panic
wave. The U.S. market was closed that day but FTSE sold off more than 3%
the day after the news. So the expectation was for US to do a catch-up
sell off when it opens again on Friday 27th. Risk aversion (equities
down, yen and dollar up) was the talk of the day. Figure 1 below shows
the charts of ES futures (e-mini S&amp;P500). Left is a 1-min. from midnight
of 27th to that morning's NYSE opening. Right is an hourly showing the
move overnight from 26th to 27th.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="ES Futures

S&amp;P 500)</a>[/caption]</p>
<h3>Intermediate term signal</h3>
<p>Figure 2 shows my intermediate term signal. EURUSD has been printing an
uptrend on the daily (not shown). Figure 2 shows that EURUSD was testing
the bottom of my channel so I should consider going long. Notice that
this is the same channel that called for the 1.5150 top on 25th. At
least it has proven itself useful once.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURUSD,
3-hour"][<img alt="EURUSD, 3-hour" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_3h.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_3h.png">EURUSD, 3-hour</a>[/caption]</p>
<h3>Short term signals</h3>
<p>For the short term signal, we need to go back to Figure 1 for the ES
charts. ES tanked 40 points over the holiday with very low volume. It
made it all the way to 1067 just before 3am on 27th. Then it lifted all
the way to 1080 at 9am. 1080 is the line in the sand for the bulls and
bears. So retracing all the way to that level before opening is
significant. This pre-open strength in ES was the sign of oversold for
me. This is the short-term confirmation I needed. I entered my first
position to long EURUSD @ 9:09 am to test the water. Then I watched both
EURUSD and ES closely for the next half hour. Once NYSE opened. I
noticed that the TICK was relatively mellow with readings around -250 to
-500. It's unusually good for a -20 points open drop on S&amp;P 500. One
would expect at least -800 readings for a strong negative sentiment. So
after watching EURUSD, ES, and TICK for about 10 minutes, I entered a
second position on a weak retracement at 9:39 am.</p>
<h3>The exits</h3>
<p>For my exit, I took profit at 1.5180 because it's the 50% Fibonacci
level and it's also the top of another of my channel (Figures 2 and 3).
After about 10 minutes of watching the 1M bars, EURUSD failed to clear
that resistance, so I took profit on the second half to go flat in this
pair just before 11 am because it's an early-closing Friday (NYSE
closing at 1pm). The gains were +95 and +93 pips for +0.27% and +0.28%
in my demo account total. Not bad for holding for 2 hours. Update:
Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jlcnuke">Jeff on Twitter</a> for the question. I updated Figure 3 with
the Fib. levels and showed the top and bottom used to draw it.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURUSD, 30

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In summary, I started with an intermediate term setup that aligns with
the major trend. I observed the reaction of the markets on an important
news. Identified an oversold condition from the short-term charts for a
short-term positive divergence signal. Scaled in a position. Then added
more with another confirmation. I scaled out when the target was hit.</p>
<h3>Recommendation</h3>
<p>Once again, I could have been more aggressive on this trade. As shown in
Figure 3, 1.4920-4930 was a short-term resistance. I could have added
more to my position when that level broke, with a stop at 1.4900.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>420 pips in my demo account to be exact. Still, I feel very lucky. In
this post, I will review why I entered this position, why I added to it,
and why I exited. The goal is for myself to learn from what works and
what can I do to improve on this trade given some hindsight advantage.</p>
<h3>The Signal</h3>
<p>See Figure 1 on the daily chart of AUDJPY (first entry price pointed
with blue arrow). Notice the lower highs, with the 2nd high inside my
fChannel and the 3rd (last, just before entry) high below a yet longer
term fChannel. Plus 1 point for the lower highs and another 1 point for
the highs moving into the channels. Two points here. [caption id=""

<h3>The Choice</h3>
<p>While both AUDJPY and AUDUSD seemed promising. I focused on AUDJPY
because the Yen seemed better poised for strength. I discussed my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-use-fx-futures-to-narrow-down-which-forex-pair-to-trade/">method of choosing a better counter currency for trading</a> in another
post, so I won't discuss it here. However, as this trade became more and
more obvious and into the green, I diversified my short by adding shorts
in NZDJPY and NZDUSD. Those two netted around +100 and +250 pips also.
Another plus 1 point for picking and choosing.</p>
<h3>The Confirmation</h3>
<p>What really gave me confidence in this trade is the price action in gold
in comparison to the Aussie. Figure 2 shows the Gold Futures price (/GC,
lower left) and Australian dollar futures (/6A, middle left). Notice
that gold has been trending up steadily for days but the Aussie made a
lower low. That's a negative divergence. Plus 1 point.</p>

<h3>The Timing</h3>
<p>For timing this trade, I observed the intraday movement of AUDJPY,
EURUSD, and other related pairs. The most obvious sign of Aussie
weakness was from comparing the price action of EURUSD and AUDJPY. The
3-hour charts of EURUSD and AUDJPY are shown in Figures 3 and 4,
respectively. Notice on Nov 24 and 25, EURUSD trended higher and made a
new high. At the same time, AUDJPY barely moved on the 24th and squeezed
even more on 25th. The difference was even more noticeable when I was
watching the 30-min at the time. I had thought that my datafeed was
lagging when AUDJPY barely moved yet EURUSD was rocketing up. Plus 1
point for the 3-hour price action and then another 1 point for the
30-minute price action (not shown).</p>

<h3>The Entries and Exits</h3>
<p>Six points total for the trade, time to establish a position. You can
see my orders in Figure 4 above. My first entry was Nov 25 15:12 at
81.37 with a half position. It is marked by a yellow triangle at the
cliff beforethe dive (how lucky). I added another half that evening
23:06 at 79.94. I was waiting for a 50% retracement to 80.50 to add but
that didn't seem to be happening. So I added 1/2 when AUDJPY failed to
break 80.0 with a strategy to add another at 80.50. But 80.50 never
happened and it took another dive. My exits are determined at the time
as usual by using stops. I simply keep moving the stop along and
narrowing them once we break support level. After the move became
vertical, I zoomed out to the daily chart to view potential targets. The
77.0 and 76.00 levels (as shown in Figure 1) became my not-be-greedy
targets. I had my stops really tight at those point and even had a take
profit set for half the position at 76.0, but that level wasn't tested
before I got stopped out. The two red dots at 77.17 and 77.08 are my
stopped exits as shown in Figure 4's last bar.</p>
<h3>The Conclusion</h3>
<p>What made this lucky trade happen is that I had spent a lot of time
analyzing it from different perspectives and watching the intraday price
actions for days. I also took my time to scale in and out to minimize my
risk. To make this a habit, I will use this point counting system from
now on to help me analyze more and trade less. One thing that I'd like
to improve upon is to be more aggressive on a winning position. How?
That will be saved for another post when I figured it out.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Last night, EURCHF finally broke below the 1.5100 zone after weeks of
consolidation around the area. See Figure 1 for a daily chart of
EUR/CHF. I just happened to be looking at the charts when this breakdown
occurred last night so I made a few day trades. These scalps turned out
better than I thought because a particular technical analysis phenomenon
worked really well on this move. Referring to Figure 2, a 5-min. chart
of the move, you'll notice that I've marked some Fibonacci levels on
each of the big dive in prices. While there are several Fibonacci levels
that are notable and commonly used, I pay attention to the 50%
retracement level almost exclusively. A half retracement is easy to spot
even with the naked eyes without any technical analysis so even those
that don't use Fibonacci can see it. With this hypothesis in mind, I
shorted EURCHF a few times last night on the bounce to 50% of each of
the move. The first entry was at 1.5048. EURCHF retraced about 50% after
that big dive from 1.5080 to 1.5030. Then it formed a descending
triangle on the 1-minute with the support at 5050. A nice round number
support level. The entry was triggered near the end of the triangle and
right when it broke the support. I held on to this short looking for the
move to take us all the way down below 1.5000 since there's bound to be
lots of stops there (which never happend last night probably because of
SNB intervention). Before that though, we made another quick dive and
then retraced 50% again. I shorted some more with a limit order placed
at the 50% level before hand. So I had two positions sitting from 5048
and 5039. See Figure 2 at the bottom for a chart with the levels marked.
However, by the third dive, it is now obvious that the move down is
getting smaller and smaller. Then when the 50% level of that last move
held for like eternity, and numerous tests of resistance at 5030 failing
yet didn't back down by much every time, I took profit at 5027-5028. The
reward/risk ratio were impressive with these trades. I risked a few pips
to make 10-20 pips. However, one mistake I made which made all these
efforts wasted. Simply put, I did not have enough position size to make
these pips gained worthwhile. Being used to swing trades with much
bigger stops, I merely used my usual lot size for these trades. The
reason being that I didn't expect these to go so well since I've always
been burned by day trading and was just testing the water with these
days. Oh well, these could all have been just because I was lucky last
night. In hindsight, I could have saved myself from all that stress and
made a lot more simply by betting on SNB intervention as many traders
have done. Recall [my lesson on fundamental analysis and the SNB pegging
up the EURCHF market][]? Well, last night presented a great opportunity
to profit from that open secret again when EURCHF tested 1.5000. The
reason why I didn't go long is because it was just too obvious that SNB
would come to the rescue. I thought that they would have waited for
running the stops below 1.5000 before intervening (note to self, don't
second guess). Well, it seems that obviousness works. The optimal entry
for a long EURCHF would have started at the point when I covered for the
same reasons. I should have eased in a long position around 1.5030 with
stop at 1.5000. A reasonable profit target would have been 1.5100. Why
1.5100? Aside from that the fact that it's an obvious resistance, this
is just something I noticed while drawing up the chart for this post. In
Figure 2, I've drawn the 161.8 % Fibonacci extension levels for those 3
down moves discussed. See that they formed the reversal targets
perfectly with equally impressive textbook perfect consolidation
reaction afterwards? If the price action adhered to the Fibonacci
retracements so well as described above, it's no surprise that a Fib.
level would work well for the reversal too. Just because the same people
are probably involved with the move down as well as the move up when all
these happened within mere hours. So two lessons from last night.</p>
<ol>
<li>I should pay more attention to the 161.8% level in my analysis along
    with the 50% level in the future.</li>
<li>and more importantly, don't think the central bank (e.g. SNB) will
    not intervene just because everyone is milking them out.</li>
</ol>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>A problem I have is that once a currency pair shows a viable trading
setup, other related pairs often show the same setup too. A reason for
this phenomenon is that markets don't operate in a vacuum. When markets
really move, everything move together. So the highly correlated markets
can scream for entry at the same time. The real question though, is
which one should I put my chips in? There are limitless methods on how
you can approach this. The one I'll talk about in this post is a simple
method of comparing your candidates using the currency futures. Why use
the futures? Because they provide a standardized platform, which is
essential when comparing things. As a bonus, there is a US dollar index
futures to help with analysis of the dollar. Not a trivial process on
its own. I will explain my method by way of an example. This morning, I
was considering to go long in AUD/JPY, CAD/JPY, AUD/USD, or short
USD/CAD according to signals from my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC setup</a>. Sure, I could have
just choose which one to trade based on the RSI rating or some other
indicator. But I don't put much faith in indicators for various reasons.
So a method I typical use is to just go through the charts to manulally
identify which has better reward/risk or better support/resistance. As
you can imagine, this is very time consuming. In practice, I only
compare AUD/JPY vs. CAD/JPY and AUD/USD vs. USD/CAD, and then compare
the winners of those two matches. Like in a tournament. Not that much of
a hassle but the issue with this approach is that I'm adding another
layer of uncertainty with all these unscientific comparisons. That could
have a significant negative impact on my trading. In a good trading
strategy, every step taken should be to improve your probability of
success or the reward/risk ratio. As such, it's better to keep my
process simple. This is where the currency futures indices is of value.
They provide a big picture perspective and serve as a standardized data
for comparison. Using my example, I needed to choose between shorting US
dollar or Japanese yen (I repeated the process for choosing AUD or CAD).
Figure 1 below shows the 4-hour chart of both currencies for the past 10
days. It's evident from the chart that the US dollar is in a range and
the Japanese yen (actually it's JPY/USD) is moving up. 1 point goes to
US dollar trade. Next, I identify the strength of the support/resistance
to estimate in the case that the trade goes against me, which would have
better cushioning. It's a crude form of risk estimation. From the figure
below, see that the dollar has a clear resistance just below 76 and it
is currently stretched away from the cyan-coloured moving average.
Whereas the yen is near a recent top with no prior occurence and it has
been sitting above the moving average for a while. Another point for
dollar short. USD 2 : JPY 0. Consequently, I went long AUD/USD this
morning instead of AUD/JPY. This is by no means a vigorous methodology.
I'm not saying that shorting US dollar is a good idea from this
simplistic comparative process. It's just that my setup tells me to go
long AUD/USD or AUD/JPY, this is just a quick and easy way to help me
decide which trade to take. Nothing more. As an aside, some people may
prefer to use currency ETF, UUP and FXY, instead. But I don't like to
use ETF as a data source as the price is noisier because they are
affected by other factors.</p>
