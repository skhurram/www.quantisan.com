            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The imminent extortion of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2011/01/31/f-faq-usage-based-billing.html">metered internet usage here in Canada</a> got
me thinking about the large amount of data (at least a few GB a month)
that I use for my trading work. In particular, I'd like to talk about
methods to filtering time series price data in this post. There is a
tradeoff between reading every tick that comes in or sampling the data
at less-frequent intervals. A common way discretionary traders present
data is by using open-high-low-close-volume (OHLCV) bars of a certain
time period. A 5-minute chart looks similar but shows different
information than a 4-hour chart, for example. Technically, this is one
way of filtering, or presenting, data by sampling at a fixed time
interval. The thing with summarizing tick data into 5-min or 4-hour data
is that you lose details in exchange for simplicity. However, the
reduction in the amount of data is significant. A year's worth of tick
data of a single currency pair, for example, runs in the gigabytes
range. Whereas a year's worth of the same data in 5-minute OHLCV bars is
merely a few ~~hundred~~ megabytes. Another factor to consider is that
market data are inherently noisy. Would feeding your system with each
and every tick be useful? Of course, if your system is able to handle
the noise, or even better, make use of it, then all the more reason to
opt for more details in the data. But that's another topic in itself. In
any case, there are 6 ways to present/filter data that I can think of.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Time interval</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Price interval</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Volume interval</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Regression modelling</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency filtering</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Wavelet transform</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, massaging data is not limited to choosing the time
period for your OHLCV bars. In fact, it's a whole distinct field
involving their own IEEE journal, <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/web/kde/home">Knowledge and Data Engineering</a>.
There is probably many other ways to filter data than these 6 that I
introduced. This is yet another topic that I would like to know more to
improve my trading system.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p><strong>Update January 26:</strong> The share price of PMV.V crossed my mental stop
yesterday so I had to reassess the position. I sold my shares at \$0.56
for a loss of (\$0.56 - \$0.62) * 1000 = \$70 + \$19.90 commission =
\$89.90 = 0.9% of account. Gold is falling while USD tanked this week.
The lack of volume on today's goldminers rally is also uncharacteristic
of the recent uptrend. The long term uptrend of gold and gold miners is
unmistakable on both fundamental and technical basis. I am taking a
dabble in this junior gold miner as its share price is making a gap fill
on a recent breakout (Fig. 1), amongst other things. Intraday chart
(Fig. 2) is also showing signs of life at this support level. What's
going to happen to gold as it breaks below 1350 (first time since
November) from worries about Chinese inflation, which led to strength in
USD (on fear of further Chinese tightening) as EURUSD dropped 60 pips in
2 hours. See FT: <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ab89d906-244e-11e0-a89a-00144feab49a.html">Fears grow that China is overheating</a>. Couple that
with political and economic uncertainty, we have a short term
uncertainty in gold's direction. However, all these is in line with the
underlying gold-bug case that money is becoming more worthless as
governments pump in money to their respective economies. Another point
to note is that as the Shanghai Composite and Bombay Stock Exchange
(i.e. growth markets) are making 3-month lows in recent weeks, people
will start to look for other assets to diversify their wealth. This is
all conjectures anyway. I can't predict the future.I am merely placing
my bet as the stars seem to have aligned for me to increase the
probability of this good reward/risk trade. Mental stop is \$0.55. Hard
stop is \$0.48, however, I'll give it some margin and say 0.40 is my
stop as liquidity is thin in this junior. Thus, risk is (\$0.62 -
\$0.40) * 1000 = \$220 + \$9.95 commission = \$229.95 = 2.4% of
account. Note: You might have noticed that my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a> style has
changed for 2011. I am trying to jot down my thought process rather than
the data analysis and numerical logic to better capture my <em>thinking</em>
for the record.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Early in 2010, I discussed about my plan to [grow my trading accounts
organically and eventually trade for a living][] (i.e. live and breath
in the market 24/7). Now that the first whole year of my long term plan
has passed, I can update my visualization table as shown. <img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2011-01-14-monetarygoal.png" /> 2010 was
a good year. My starting capital for 2011 is 63% more than expected.
This is mostly due to the \$13,000 prize money from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">winning six of nine
Dukascopy automated trading contests</a>. On the contrary to my
fortuitous success, I revised some of my estimations noted in the table
to be even more conservative. In particular, I reduced my annual deposit
to reflect real bookkeeping data in 2010 and lowered my investment yield
expectation based on my performance data throughout the past 10 years of
my trading. To mitigate these reductions, I expect to continue
depositing funds while I receive a salaried income rather than stop
mid-way as originally proposed. The effect of inflation is deliberately
ignored in this table because I'm discounting its effect in my
investment yield estimate rather than adding more columns. It's all
guess work for now anyway. Nineteen years is indeed a long time. It is a
<em>worst case scenario</em> assuming that I will grow my accounts organically
and not do anything else. I doubt I will need that much time as there
are means other than trading a personal account to achieve trading for a
living. I might discuss more about this later in the year once something
materialize. My focus this year is to finish developing my proprietary
Java trading platform with my partner and put it to good use in the
forex market. Nineteen years or not, the fact that trading for a living
is even possible for a self-taught amateur such as myself is testament
to these incredible times that we're living in. I fully intend to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-sign-that-you-are-truly-enjoying-what-you-do/">enjoy

I was just organizing my bookshelf the other day and is surprised by how
fast my collection of statistics books have grown. I studied statistics
back in school as a stepping stone to learning stochastic process for
wireless communication theories (e.g. CDMA). Detecting radio-frequency
and resolving wireless signals to meaningful messages is fundamentally
about assessing the state of random processes. I hated statistics back
then because I didn't *get it* and did poorly in those courses. It is
ironic that years later I would realize how much I have grown to rely
and love the little *p*'s and *q*'s in my little hobby of quantitative
trading. I still don't like statistics (or theoretical math), per se. I
just love *applying* them in my trading and quant programs. The more
that I learn about statistics, the more that I realize how powerful they
can be and how ignorant I am. For example, in my clinical study days I
used either t-test or ANOVA for everything under the sun. Now that I've
come to understanding about inferential statistics, I am aware of the
assumptions and pitfalls such as the assumption of t-tests of
homogeneity of variance between the two samples tested. If this
assumption is violated, then the unequal variance t-test should be used.
Finer points like these are routinely ignored in practice because many
clinical studies are inherently designed in the experiment to meet these
criteria. However, that's not the case when I am making creative use of
statistics in my trading. I don't have a clinical study committee
watching over my back. If I make a false or weaker-than-expected claim
and don't know better, then it is my bank account that will suffer the
consequences. Learning statistics was initially due to this
got-to-know-better necessity. However, the more that I learn about
statistics, the more that I appreciate it. If used correctly, statistics
can provide a new dimension to the scientific assessment of your trading
performance and market data.
