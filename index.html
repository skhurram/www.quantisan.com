            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>We had questions about how Go compares with Clojure at the Boston Clojure Meetup this week. My default answer to any technology this-vs-that debate is -- <em>it depends</em>. But it just so happens that our backend system at Glassy Media consist of an even split of services written between Go and Clojure. However, this isn't due to any technical reasoning. Using the two languages together feels right to our particular needs.</p>
<p>Rich Hickey made clear the distinction between simple and easy in his famous talk, <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a>. Clojure made simple easy. But sometimes I don't want simple and easy. I want quick and easy. That is exactly where Go can complement Clojure.</p>
<p><img alt="Simple, Easy, Quick" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/simple_easy_quick_triangle.png" /></p>
<p>How Clojure made simple easy has been a path well beaten. The rest of this post is why I think Go is quick and easy.</p>
<h2>Our Path To Go</h2>
<p>Once upon a time (i.e. a few months ago) our backend cogs and gears consisted of a bunch of command line programs that we would run on our laptop every now and then to churn our data. We distributed those tools to our non-developer helpers to serve our clients. Those command line tools started out in Python or Node.js. But distributing, maintaining, and updating those programs to other people's laptops eventually became a real pain. So one weekend I rewrote one of our command line programs in Go. On Monday I shared a link to a single executable file on Dropbox and people were able to run it directly from there. No more asking people to go on command line and typing <code>pip install</code> or <code>npm install</code>. That was how we started using Go at Glassy Media.</p>
<p>I had no prior experience with Go before that. The fact that I was able to learn the language and then produce something useful over a weekend doesn't have to do with me. It is the practicality of the language, clear documentation, and smart tooling that makes Go easy to ramp up.</p>
<h3>Language Practicality</h3>
<p>Take the <code>for</code> loop as an example, you can iterate over a map like so. (code sample taken from <a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#for">Effective Go</a>)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="nx">key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">value</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="k">range</span> <span class="nx">oldMap</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">newMap</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">key</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nx">value</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The same <code>range</code> can be used to iterate over an array:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">sum</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="nx">_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">value</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="k">range</span> <span class="nx">array</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">sum</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="nx">value</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>No need for additional syntax to do the same thing. And there're no <code>while</code> or <code>do</code> loops too. There is only <code>for</code> to do all of that as shown.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// complete `for` struct</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="nx">init</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">condition</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">post</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// only check condition like a `while`</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="nx">condition</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// or, nothing like a `do`</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The Go core syntax is consistently minimal like so.</p>
<h3>Clear Documentation</h3>
<p>From <a href="http://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code">The Go Programming Language</a>,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre> <span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">Go</span> <span class="n">project</span> <span class="n">takes</span> <span class="n">documentation</span> <span class="n">seriously</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">Documentation</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">huge</span> <span class="n">part</span>

</pre></div>


<p>Go's source code documentation has simple convention and automatic publishing. Take our trivial <a href="https://github.com/GlassyMedia/go-arrays">go-arrays library for manipulating arrays</a>. Here is one of the functions and its docstring.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// Contains check if &#39;s&#39; is in &#39;coll&#39; string array</span>
<span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nx">Contains</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">s</span> <span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">coll</span> <span class="p">[]</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>What's amazing is that a corresponding project documentation page is automatically scraped from our source code and hosted on GoDoc.org with no extra work needed on our part. So as soon as you pushed a project onto Github, you can request your project documentation on GoDoc.org website. Here is a screenshot of one.</p>
<p><img alt="Godoc.org for go-arrays" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/godoc_screen.png" /></p>
<p>Because software documentation is baked into the process, I find most of the Go libraries are less frustrating to pickup.</p>
<h3>Smart Tooling</h3>
<p>I don't know why GoFmt isn't more common in programming. GoFmt is a tool that automatically <a href="http://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">formats Go source code</a>. It is like <code>jshint</code> or <code>pyflakes</code> but goes an extra step further and actually fixes your code styling for you too. No more <code>gg=G</code> in Vim.</p>
<p>Consistent source code styling makes life so much easier when digging into other people's projects.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoy the workflow developing in Go. There is no interactive REPL. What you get is an almost instant <code>go test</code> and <code>go run</code> execution time. Coming from doing everything in Vim, switching between my editor and the command line isn't as annoying as I would have thought.</p>
<p>One reason for that is because the workflow is different when developing in Go. GoFmt is integrated in Vim (and other typical editors); along with the fact that Go is statically typed, by the time when your code saves without error, most of the time it would work as expected. So it's not that often when I need to resort to doing <code>go test</code> to check my code.</p>
<h3>Go for Web Services</h3>
<p>Having had Go in production for only a few months, our experience with Go is limited. Still, what stands out the most with Go is using it to build web services. Take our SMTP callback verification service, for example. The HTTP server code for it is <a href="https://github.com/GlassyMedia/smtp-callback-verification/blob/master/web.go">under 50 lines</a> using <a href="https://github.com/ant0ine/go-json-rest">go-json-rest</a> and a couple core packages. Not only that, Go has <a href="https://github.com/GlassyMedia/smtp-callback-verification/blob/master/web_test.go">mock HTTP server testing functionality built right in</a>.</p>
<p>I am aware that this is subjective. But having used a handful of languages and frameworks to build RESTful web services, Go is by far the easiest to get a server up and running.</p>
<h2>Complementing Clojure with Go</h2>
<p>The one time when I had to choose between Go vs. Clojure was when the Boston Go Meetup happened on the same night as the Boston Clojure Meetup.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/BostonGolang">@bostongolang</a> hmm... didn&#39;t think I&#39;ll have to take side Clojure vs. Go so soon</p>&mdash; Paul Lam (@quantisan) <a href="https://twitter.com/quantisan/statuses/446389305972621312">March 19, 2014</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Otherwise, there is no reason that Go and Clojure can't work along each other as part of a suite of toolset.</p>
<p>Everyone has their tools of choice. Your taste and circumstance are probably different than mine. What matters is that the tools in your toolbox as a whole fit the problems that you face. Go and Clojure fill different needs for us.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been growing fond of this trendy Go programming language lately. We use it at Glassy Media to build services over HTTP and command line. So when we needed a Amazon Mechanical Turk interface I thought why not use Go for that too? I found an existing library in <a href="https://github.com/crowdmob/goamz">Go for interacting with Amazon Web Services</a>. But its Mechanical Turk component is incomplete. So I dove into the source code and started patching to make it work.</p>
<p>A weekend of coding later, I still haven't finished. Then I realised what I was doing. I was building a cool solution but not actually solving the problem at hand. This might have been beneficial for a capable company to help contribute back to the open source community. But not where I'm at -- a new startup that's stretching thin on resources. We simply couldn't afford to lose focus at this phase. So I switched over to good ole Python. The <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto">boto</a> Python interface to AWS worked just fine. The result was that there were no "I did this in Go" blog post to write about but our problem was solved and we moved on to the next task.</p>
<p>This sense of building cool solutions just for the sake of it seem common in tech. Just last week at a Go meetup, someone spoke about Using Reflections in Go. Even Rob Pike, the man himself, wrote that reflection "should be used with care and avoided unless strictly necessary". Somehow that was taken as a challenge.</p>
<p><img alt="challenge accepted" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/200px-challenge-acepted.png" /></p>
<p>I am guilty of glorifying new technologies and putting down on tried and true solutions too. On more occasions than I dare to admit at data conferences, I participated in bashing at SQL databases with the attendees. I can't speak for others, but for me it was due to ignorance. I used SQL a few times before but was put off by the data warehousing aspect of it. Having gotten more familiar with MySQL in particular over the past couple years, SQL can be simple and beautiful too. I have actually come to prefer it in some cases. Use the right tool for the right task, right?</p>
<p>An example of focusing on solving the problem. Here is one of the distilled tech specs we have for a component.</p>
<ol>
<li>A webpage for users to view a dataset of their private contacts</li>
<li>Sorting capabilities on some of the data fields</li>
<li>Expected number of contacts per user is several hundreds</li>
<li>Limit to no more than 10 - 20 users at beta launch</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the efforts went into distilling our problem to make it as easy as possible. Like letting the user edit the data? Nope. UX design? Not until we figure out what data to surface. Because the problem specs are concise, solving this is almost trivial. Our current technical stack to solve this is embarassingly simplistic:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS/Javascript for front end hosted on Heroku,</li>
<li>Go for REST-based backend on Heroku; and</li>
<li>Google Spreadsheet as database.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing fancy. Yes, we didn't even bother with spinning up a database.</p>
<p>People build more complicated things in a hackday than this. That's because the real problem we have is that we <em>think</em> this is needed with no real proof yet. Perhaps all they need is just having CSV files emailed to them? We tried that too. We want to get this out to our customers as soon as possible for them to use and give us feedback. What is the task that this component is doing for our customers in the scope of our product experience? Abstract problems like these are not trivial and validating them is why we are building things in a startup. Not the other way around.</p>
<p>As I was reminiscing earlier this year, effective problem solving is more about <a href="/what-i-learned-from-2-years-of-data-sciencing/">defining a clear problem than coming up with a smart solution</a>. "A problem well stated is a problem half-solved." In a pursuit of the latest and greatest, I sometimes find myself swung too far in the pendulum towards <a href="/event-driven-finite-state-machine-for-a-distributed-trading-system/">glorifying the solution</a> rather than appreciating the effectiveness of clarifying the problem. Sometimes the best solution is to realise <em>not</em> to do something.</p>
<p>At this early stage of our startup, the biggest problem should clearly be shipping and learning. Being a Clojure enthusiast myself, we've only used Clojure for 2 of the dozen or so of projects shipped. Most of the rest are a mix of Python, Go, Javascript, Bash scripts, or even Google Doc macros. However, don't mistaken getting things done quickly with cutting corners or committing spaghetti code.  We are adament about keeping our software architecture as simple and decoupled as possible. If that's done right, the individual implementation don't matter because we can always rewrite any of them without impacting the system. That Mechanical Turk project? You can bet that we'll come back to refactor it later if it proves useful. Maybe we'll pick up on goamz again. But at least it's shipped now. I am focusing on the problem and not let building a startup become a technical challenge to satisfy my vanity.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>We knew early on that paying customers is the only metric that we can believe in. We have paying customers now, but we don't have a business yet until we know our product/market fit. A problem with having paying customers is that the day-to-day work of delivering and executing can drown out the big picture. Thinking in first principles helps keep us iterating towards a product/market fit while we immerse ourselves on learning from our individual customers.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">only</span> <span class="n">thing</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">matters</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">getting</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">product</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">market</span> <span class="n">fit</span><span class="p">.</span>

</pre></div>


<p>First of all, what does it getting to product/market fit mean? After some failed starts and pivots to our business, I think I sort of get it now. Here are three questions we ask ourselves to check if we are heading to a product/market fit.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this viable with the resources we have now?</li>
<li>Is this profitable before our next bills arrive?</li>
<li>Is this scalable to take us to our next stage?</li>
</ol>
<p>One lesson we learned is to focus on the immediate future. Not 6 months down the line. Our company simply couldn't afford to try things out for 6 months with a mere chance of success. We try to find our product-market fit now to take us there, not the other way around.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, we have a few paying customers but we still haven't found our product/market fit yet. We have a product. With a market. But not necessarily a <em>fit</em>. A fit imples an optimal product and market match.</p>
<p>Last week, it finally dawned on me that finding a product/market fit is an optimisation problem. What are the variables that you're optimising for?</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p><img alt="Supply Demand curve" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/400px-Supply-and-demand.svg.png" /></p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>I realised that product/market fit is supply and demand in disguise. Finding a product/market fit is an exercise in finding your supply and demand curves. This puts the abstract problem of finding product/market fit into data exploration actions to take to fill a graph.</p>
<p>Taking our startup as an example, this is our supply curve at the moment (drawn as a straight line for simplicity).</p>
<p><img alt="Inelastic supply curve" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/inelastic_supply_curve.png" /></p>
<p>A bit of background. Our main product isn't a web application or a software yet, it is a service. We delivered for our first clients through hustling and manual labour. As a 3-person startup, there are only so many clients we can take on while we are developing our software tools. So our supply curve is limited by capacity and is insensitive to price.</p>
<p>Note that there is theoretically an infinite set of options, deliverables, and products that we can offer in our market space. The lines that we draw would be different for each set. So bear in mind that this is not an academic proof but <em>a mental exercise</em> to help us move systematically faster.</p>
<p>Now that we have our supply curve/line, we only need the demand curve to complete this graph. This is the side of the market that we are most uncertain about. What does our client really want? How much are they willing to pay?</p>
<p><img alt="Supply and unknown demand curves" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/supply_unknown_demand_curve.png" /></p>
<p>We sold to our first clients at a price point that is a fraction of industry average to get our hands dirty and to learn if we can do this (Question #1). We quickly reached our capacity and was inundated with work to deliver on our promise. But remember that our goal is to learn our supply and demand graph and not necessarily <em>only</em> to learn about our individual customer needs. Referring to the supply and demand graph below where we undersold at a low price, yes, we learned about our work process, but we didn't learn anything about the demand curve at that price simply because we couldn't meet the demand. After we were at capacity, we stopped looking for clients for a couple weeks while we served the ones onboard.</p>
<p><img alt="Supply and demand at artificially low price" src="http://www.quantisan.com/images/2014/low_price_supply_demand.png" /></p>
<p>Suppose our capacity is 3 clients at a time. If we sold at a higher price and had 3 of 10 people said yes (instead of 3 of 3 we had at a low price), we learned something about the price while still signing up to the same number of customers. Then we could adjust our price to a bit lower in the next round to find 3 of 7 people sign up instead. With a slight change in approach, we would be getting data about our demand curve while serving the same number of clients.</p>

<p>This is one illustration of how thinking in supply and demand can make us go faster. Now that we can rely on existing principles in our product/market search, we can do this systematically. Much smarter people have thought about microeonomics and laid the ground work for us to leverage. Hopefully we can find our product/market fit even faster with these principles in hand.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Last week was my last day at uSwitch.com. From becoming aware of <em>data scientist</em> as a valid job title on my job offer letter, to speaking at Strata London, to signing a book deal to write about it in our book on Web Data Mining (that's progressing at a glacial pace), I figured that I should jot down some takeaway lessons while this experience is still fresh.</p>

<h2>It is not about the <em>science</em>. It is about the <em>data</em>.</h2>
<p>In my first year our team delivered a handful of data projects. To name just a few, we developed a dashboard showing lifetime values for all of our millions of customers, demonstrating a 6% revenue gain with a product showcase sorting algorithm modelled by the multi-armed bandit problem, and simulated offline advertising impacts to online sales for optimising marketing spending saving £20,000 a month. For various reasons, none of these projects gained traction within the company and became abandoned.</p>
<p>Much of the efforts spent for those projects were in getting the right data into the right shape. We needed to capture events across applications on different technology stacks, associate individual events to unique customers, and being able to process all those data in an ad-hoc manner. Over the course of my first year, our team of 2 built and evolved a distributed data architecture and scalable data workflow that's based on open source tools and publications from companies like Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. In fact, I scratched enough of my own itch on an open source big data processing project to become one of the maintainers for it.</p>

<p>On a rather "by the way" note, we structured lifetime views of customer data from the disparate signals across company verticals. Words had been going around the company that we had this new business intelligence tool, more and more people asked us to help them answer questions with data on their side of the business. The data we surfaced from our data workflow satisfied a wide-spread need in the company to understand customer behaviours. Little did I know that we'll be cleaning and shaping data for most of my second year at uSwitch. Months later to recent times, our commercial team released an external data product that I can't say much but might bring in sizable benefits for the company soon.</p>
<p>It is glamorous to talk about the latest and greatest machine learning or data visualisation. In practice, I was just cleaning and shaping data. Enabling more people to make use of deep and structured data was what delivered value to the company.</p>
<h2>Figuring out the right problems to solve is not easy.</h2>
<p>Had we known that customer behaviour analytics are so valuable, we would have done it earlier on (although many of the other projects were definitely a lot of fun to do). Figuring out the right work to do is one of the most difficult tasks for a data science team. It doesn't help with the fact that the data science role is so vague. Marketing think we are mining for customer insights. Developers think we're toying with Riemann, Storm, or something bleeding edge. Product managers think we are plotting graphs.</p>
<p>Everyone has ideas but there were only 3 of us in the team. Figuring out where to devote our time and effort is not as easy as it sounds. The issue is that a new project can be almost anything. So which <em>one</em> should we do? The paradox of choice can be confusing.</p>
<p>Seeing that this is data science, why not dive right into the data like they would often say in hackathons? I made the mistake in the first few weeks in my data science career just hacking away with the data and then trying to persuade people to make use of the result ... somehow.</p>
<p>Some interesting graphs came about. But as <a href="https://twitter.com/dancingmango">Marc</a> often like to ask, "so what?" Unless someone or something can act on the data, results can only satisfy intellectual curiosity. A business can't survive on funding people to carry out academic studies forever.</p>
<p>Nowadays, we talk to different stakeholders to try to dig as deep as possible into their needs before any code is written for a new project. This is me handwaving. Frankly, I'm still learning my way and rely a lot on luck through trials and errors to discovering the right problems to solve.</p>
<h2>It is a humbling experience.</h2>
<p>Working with <a href="http://oobaloo.co.uk/">Paul Ingles</a> and <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/abigail-lebrecht/2/95a/42">Abigail Lebrecht</a> has been frustratingly awesome. Paul is opinionated about doing things as simple as possible. On more occasions than I can remember, we implemented our own little Clojure libraries because the open source ones available were "trying to do too much". Abigail is adamant about getting the data and analyses right. "What do you mean this data is only 99% correct?" Working day in and day out with Paul and Abigail showed that I had much to learn in efficient problem solving and to question all hidden assumptions.</p>
<p>In my previous role as a biomedical engineer, I also had the opportunity to work in a multidisciplinary team. But for my <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1743-0003-5-15.pdf">haptic-robotic therapy project</a>, I never even considered going into a workshop to build my robot or provide clinical therapy for the stroke patients. What multidisciplinary meant back then were a small group of professionals coming together to work on a project with each person doing different tasks to get the thing to work.</p>
<p>The advantage of being a data scientist is that I was very hands-on in all aspects of the work. One week I might be pair programming with Paul, and fighting to keep him away from my keyboard, to integrate Riemann for monitoring our data architecture. Other days I am debating with Abigail on the data mining side. Which usually resulted from her finding flaws in the materialised tables that I produced from Cascalog, and then having to come up with a better estimation model for the missing data.</p>
<h2>So do you want to be a data scientist?</h2>
<p>This is it for me formally as a data scientist. I am moving back across the Atlantic to the states to cofound a new venture and continuing my journey <a href="http://www.glassymedia.com">to make information accessible</a>. However, back to the topic at hand. If cleaning vast amount of data, being clueless as to what to do, and debating with colleagues sound like a challenge that you want to take on, I know a company in London that's <a href="http://www.uswitch.com/careers/">looking for a data scientist</a>!</p> </div>
