<p>The market broke my intraday support line today (pink line, first
graph). What appeared to be a good Monday turned out to be very
disappointing. I cleared the last of my short puts (i.e. long) about 5
seconds before the close when the market gained some footing. These
plays are purely for risk management purposes, each individual stock
looks ok to me to be accumulating at this level. But I'm in for the
swing trade and it haven't worked out. So I'm selling them all mainly
because the overall market looks weak.</p>
<p>To illustrate, today's intraday market data looked particularly bad. I
thought the market would turnaround after the TICK retested a -1200 low
for the day at noon on lower price, but the price continued to drift
down afterward. Then the 2pm rally didn't even break 930 (resistance
from yesterday) too. That was the last draw for me and I decided to exit
all risky positions from then on to minimize my risk. So I covered all
my options into the close.</p>
<p>The first of which was Dec SLW 5 put at 15:48 for \$1.70, which I
[bought at \$1.55][]. I still have my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-166-slw882-limit/">166 shares of SLW</a>, so it's an
obvious choice for me to unload the options. I don't want to be too
heavy on precious metal for now. SLW is still holding the \$3.4 level
and marked a higher low in the afternoon. So it's actually looking good.</p>

<p>Next I sold FRO at 15:59:27. The low of today looks like a test of a
daily trendline, pink line below on the right daily graph (Update: I
forgot to attach the graph. I added it a day later below). I normally
would have only sold if it breaks it, but again, the market looks bad.
So a retest of \$30 (highest volume in recent months) seems possible. I
covered the [FRO short puts bought at \$7.90][] for \$8.00. On another
note, I mistakenly placed a sell order on the put rather than a buy (to
cover) at \$8.10. So I quickly covered that accidental trade at \$8.30
regardless of that fact that FRO was moving up at that time. I've
learned my lesson in accidental orders and would cover immediately
regardless. I won't try to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-58-caf-2889-limit/">convince myself like my CAF trade</a>.</p>

<p>I covered my Nov [WFC short put bought at \$3.60][] for \$3.00 at
15:59:55. Fee \$7.50.</p>
<p>I almost didn't want to give up my WFC position. It was the strongest
and the one most profitable of my Friday's swing trades. In particular,
last Friday's turnaround has by far the most volume in several months.
The \$28.0 support looks almost impenetrable. Indeed, today's low of
\$28.04 looks safe and we only tested it at very low volume. Indeed, I
really don't think we'll see this low again in the short term. Looking
at this more carefully now, maybe I should leave it open ... Oh well, I
can always get back in.</p>

<p>I've sold my [CAF position bought at \$28.89][] for \$21.69. A loss of
about \$430. I placed a limit order, and only 56 of the 58 went through.
I'll assume my 2 remaining shares will go through some time today (it
has gone through as I'm writing this). Fee \$5.</p>
<p>CAF gapped open about \$2 today due to this weekend's news of [China's
plan for a stimulus package of about US\$586 billion][]. However, CAF
seem to be being faded on this news. The total downtick volume looks
significant.</p>
<p>On the other hand, FXP (UltraShort China) looks to be on the rise. A
break of above \$70 would be very bullish for it.</p>

<p>My bullish view on China in the long term still remains strong. However,
I don't think we're in a time for buy-and-hold strategy anymore. This is
definitely a trader's market and I intend to put my money for swing
trading opportunities. Even though I sold at a significant loss and a
return of CAF to \$25 level seems likely in the short term, I believe I
will lose even more in opportunity cost if my fund is tied with CAF. So
I'm exiting on this weekend news and price strength.</p>

<p>Wrote a put on Nov WFC strike 31 for \$3.60. Fee \$7.5 as usual for
options. WFC tested the critical \$27 support level today with a gap
down. The price gradually recovered with increasing volume. On the daily
chart, the overarching trend is still up from the 200 dma. But there's
some wild swings over the last few months, including the capitulation
this week from \$35 to \$27. We have tested the \$27 level today with
strong intraday action.</p>
<p>In particular, the S&amp;P is holding on the 910-915 level. In particular,
the 3:15pm test of 915 occurred at the all-day TICK low. Note the middle
graph of the NYSE TICK, we bounced at 915 right when the TICK reached a
new intraday low. This is a significant show of strength and it leads me
to believe the retracement from the rally has ended. We'll probably be
continuing the uptrend next week.</p>

<p>Upside: As explained above, looks like a rally in the broad market. The
financials should be winners since they dropped the most and this is a
bear rally. WFC is a strong contender in the financials, so I picked it
to ride this wave. Bought this mostly based on the technical analysis,
the \$27 test looked good.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$31.3, top of the gap down open from yesterday.</p>
<p>Downside: Stock tanked in last 3 days, from \$35 to \$27.</p>
<p>Support: \$27.</p>
<p>Bottom line: I'm just choosing to ride the strongest bull I could find
in an expected rally. I chose the 31 strike because of the gap down open
(\$31.3 - \$31.0) yesterday. We should fill it if this were to go up.
WFC was just below \$28 when I bought this, it has closed at \$29.50 on
a multi-day 15 min high volume. This is a short term play only, I'll let
it go when everyone else are smiling next week or two.</p>

<p>Bullish position by shorting puts here. I am using a NOV options because
I want to keep this for the short term. I would like to unload bad
positions later on and scale into FRO shares since I think it's worth
holding for the long term. Why? 35% dividend yield! I doubt the dividend
can maintain at this level in the future, but even at half of current
dividend, it's still a decent buy at this point.</p>
<p>Upside: Max pain at \$45 for Nov. Price-volume looks good, like we
tested 20 dma \$32.2 level just now on low volume. Stock looks to be in
uptrend.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$42</p>
<p>Downside: Broke 20 dma at about \$32.2 yesterday. Still at critical
level around \$32. Could just as well break down from here.</p>
<p>Support: \$31</p>
<p>Bottom line: Simply a good risk/reward ratio for me to take a position
here. The chance of us moving up here in the broad market is better than
if we go down. I intend to hold this until at least Monday. Mental
support just below support.</p>

<p>Short puts on Dec SLW stroke 5 for \$1.55.</p>
<p>Upside: The move from \$4 to \$3.78 was low volume and \$3.78 is a
support level from yesterday. S&amp;P also dropped from 940 to 920 and
stayed there for a bit on low volume.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$4</p>
<p>Downside: Silver price down slightly. Market in short term down trend.</p>
<p>Support: \$3.7.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is a short term trade with a small position to test
the water. Mental stop is S&amp;P 916.</p>
<p>Update: S&amp;P dipped to 913 briefly then returned to 917 level. I was
hungry so I went to lunch and left this as is. S&amp;P is back to 920+ level
after an hour. I think I will let this play out without hugging the
monitor every minute. I've got other work to do.</p>
