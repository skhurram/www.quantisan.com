            <div class="article-content"> <p>Partnering with the marketing team at work earlier this month reminded
me of an important lesson in my algorithmic trading. Our  external TV
agency presented a mid-term performance analysis and I was tasked with
performing due diligence on their analysis methodology. It took me 2
minutes to realise that they were using a linear regression model. At
first I thought it was too simplistic. Then I realised my own naivete
because it was never about accuracy to begin with. Measuring ROI on a
marketing campaign is an illusive task. A quick metric is to perform a
regression on the money you spent versus the revenue generated in the
same time period. For example, let y(t) = x(t), where y represents
revenue, x is marketing spending, and t is day. Plot your data on y
versus x for a number of days. Then draw a best fit straight line to
graphically show a correlation. If you're feeling adventurous, throw in
a few other factors that you think might have important influence on
your daily revenue. Such that you have x2(t), x3(t), etc. This is what
the agency did in their model. One major flaw with using a regression
model for this purpose is that it assumes each data point is mutually
exclusive to another. So a day's event does not influence another. This
is simply not true in the real world. For examples, it might take a few
days after someone sees your ad until they click your buy button or it
might take more than a few showing of the ads until people take action.
A better regression model for the first example is y(t) = x1(t - a),
where 'a' is the delay. And for the second example, y(t) = ∑x1(t - A),
where A is a vector of 'a'. The problem with this is that finding 'a'
and 'A' is another regression problem in and of itself. Luckily, this is
conceptually what an Artificial Neural Network does, a series of
regression models taking into account the interrelation of the factors
and non-linear effects of the response. And so, within the span of a few
minutes of our conference call with them, I've just convinced myself in
my mind to try another algorithm when I have a chance. That weekend I
wasted a few hours on R tinkering with the data. Then it finally dawned
on me. What is the value of this? To calculate an ROI figure on our
marketing campaign, is it necessary to spike a machine learning project
just so we can be 95% confident on that figure? The justification is
further weakened by the fact that ROI is merely one of the many metrics
available when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_performance_measurement_and_management">evaluating a marketing campaign</a>. So the impact of an
accurate model versus a throw in the dart might not be worth spending an
extra two weeks working on it whereas a throwing a dart takes only one
command in R.</p> </div>

<p>First of all, his solutions looked much cleaner <a href="/eureka-moment-on-design-patterns-for-functional-programming/">than mine</a>. Then over
the weekend I was able to incorporate his 3 algorithms into my program.
I ran a few benchmarks and here are the average of 2 tests using a
dataset of 28,760 items.</p>
<ul>
<li>My algorithm. Elapsed time: 68372.026532 msecs.</li>
<li>Kevin's solution #1. Elapsed time: 156.940976 msecs.</li>
<li>Kevin's solution #2. Elapsed time: 60.165483 msecs.</li>

</ul>
<p>Total ownage. That's what I like about sharing my
work; once in a blue moon, a reader drops by and generously show
me how I can improve a solution 1,000 times! Now the ball is in my hands
to understand what he has done and improve myself. Collaborating and
learning, that's why I open source.</p>
<p>Update: I've done some more digging and it seems that one of the reasons for the drastic improvement in performance is due to the use of <a href="http://clojure.org/transients">transients</a> in the built-in functions. Lesson of the day, leverage the language's inherent optimization by staying with core data structures and functions as much as possible.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Understanding design patterns for object-oriented programming made my
life easier as a Java programmer. So I have been looking for a
comparable book for functional programming ever since my sojourn into
this age-old paradigm. It looks as though <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2930277/functional-programming-equivalent-of-design-patterns-book">I'm not the only one
looking</a> too. But the thing is, I think I've just had a revelation of
sort.</p>
<p>There is one and only one guideline to designing functional
architectures -- Keep it simple. Simple as in keeping your functions
having a single purpose only. Simple as in work with the data directly and
don't conjure unnecessary intermediaries. Simple, as elaborated by Rich
Hickey in his talk, <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a>. Much of this is conveyed in Bloch's Effective Java:</p>

<p>As such, there is no design pattern book for functional programming. I didn't get that earlier this year. But something clicked recently. During the past few months, I've been doing some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/ive-quit-my-day-job-and-moved-to-the-uk-to-do-this-full-time/">consulting and open source projects</a> solving algorithmic problems with Clojure.</p>
<p>One of the problems in a project that I was faced with this week is calculating the occurrence of each distinctive element within a list of elements. Say we have a list, <code>coll = ("orange", "bottle", "coke", "bottle")</code>. The output would be something like <code>[("orange", "bottle", "coke") (1 2 1)]</code> </p>
<p>This is my first solution.</p>

<p>The specs are not exactly as I described but the concept remains. What I
did is to use tail calls (it's supposed to be fast, isn't it?) to
aggregate each counter to produce a vector of counts. Then I map each
pair of fragment with its corresponding count to generate a final output
collection. Sounds overly complicated, doesn't it?</p>
<p>This is the first warning of a bad functional design. For a collection of 30,000 items,
this function took 11 minutes to compute on my notebook. This looks like
a good place to exploit the parallel nature of this problem.</p>
<p>Specifically, the counting of each fragment is independent of other
fragments. Thus, there's no need for the program to wait for one
fragment to finish to process the next. I simplified the program to
remove this inherent assumption of procedural processing. Here is the
gist of the refactored code where each function only does one job. Since
the processing are modularised, I can parallelize the algorithm easily
with the use of pmap instead of map on the last line as shown below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">match-count</span>
<span class="s">&quot; Given key, k, returns number of occurrences of k in collection, coll.</span>

<p>I've split the first function into 3 functions (2 shown here). As Hickey
said in his talk, simplifying can often produce more, not less,
functions. Yet, the program is not only easier to read and runs in less
than a minute. An order of magnitude faster! There are still lots for me
to learn. I want to find more challenging projects to push my own
limits. But rather than solving arbitrary problems, I prefer to tackle
real-world challenges. So if you know of anyone that can benefit from
collaborating with a functional developer to build robust and scalable
software, please pass along <a href="mailto:paul@quantisan.com">my contact</a>.</p>
<p>Follow up: Kevin Lynagh showed me three better ways of doing this in a follow-up post – <a href="/algorithmic-ownage/">Algorithmimc ownage</a>. Humbled.</p> </div>
