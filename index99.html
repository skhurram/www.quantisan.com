            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I was saying this morning, I placed an order before going to work for
a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/general-electric-the-next-aig/">Apr09 11/10 strangle on General Electric</a> (GE). My limit was at
\$1.31 (total) but the morning mark started at \$1.37 and kept creeping
up. I waited until 10 am and GE slowly gained in price. It stayed above
\$11 shortly and so I checked the strangle price on the 12/11 instead.
It was about \$1.40 too. So I just changed my order from 11/10 to 12/11
and upped my limit to meet the mid spread.</p>
<p>The risk profile for 12/11 is definitely different than 11/10. 11/10
would have been a good neutral position because GE is obviously
congested around the \$10.xx range. The 12/11 range is more short-heavy
because GE was only around \$11.07 when I entered. It's at the top of a
trading range. However, I took it anyway because I'm actually leaning to
the short side, in case you haven't noticed...</p>
<p>As you can see from Figure 1, daily on left and weekly on right, \$10.5
is a major long term pivot point. We are testing it at the moment on
weak volumn. Figure 2 shows the hourly on left and daily on right. As I
was saying this morning, GE's rally in March looks weaker as compared to
S&amp;P 500. The 10d MA haven't even crossed the 40d MA yet. Add to that,
last time the indicators were at this almost overbought level was last
year in the \$15 range. You can see what happened to that afterward. GE
skidded down to \$6.</p>
<p>However, we have broken that long term downtrend, see Figure 3. And
we're forming a long flag. This is definitely a glaringly bullish sign.
After all, we can't keep using the same channel forever.</p>
<p>Rather long or short, the important point is that GE is at a major
junction right now. Although I'm favouring the short side, but from
observing the action of the market in the past few days, there's also a
good chance GE will get lifted along with the rest of the market soon.
That's why I've put on a strangle to take advantage of both the long and
the short prospects.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>On another note,<a href="http://xtrends.blogspot.com/2009/03/what-will-be-different-this-time.html">xTrends pointed to GE</a> as being a great upcoming
short play. Look at the long term chart below, daily on left and weekly
on right.</p>
<p>First on the daily to the left, we have increasing price and decreasing
volume since the climb from the bottom. Stochastic is making a bearish
crossover in the upper half (would have been nice if it's higher). And
every time it does that in the past year, GE goes sliding down. Volume
weighted MACD is also showing a negative divergence. GE is stalling
above \$10 but its V-MACD is higher than previously in the \$10 zone.</p>
<p>As for the weekly chart on the right, it's obvious GE is in a major
downtrend. And so is everything else. However, compared to the S&amp;P 500
it is certainly lagging on this recent rally in the past month or so.
That is certainly a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>Update: I like it enough that I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">entered a strangle order for GE
around \$10-11</a>. It's going to pop one way or the other.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>No, I haven't unloaded my GS short yet. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-gs-100-apr-09-105-put-872/">I said I would unload it if GS
manage to stay above \$110</a>. But it closed at \$110.60 yesterday. I
can live with a \$0.60 difference.</p>
<p>I watched GS for most of the day yesterday. It's action above \$110 seem
a bit lackluster. Looking at the chart, particularly the daily, you can
see the sword-like candlestick from yesterday. There's probably a name
for it, but I don't remember. Add to that, S&amp;P500 just tested 820
resistance yesterday.</p>
<p>GS's move above \$110 is certainly interesting. The correct play would
be for it to break below \$110 and then observe the pullback, then if
it's weak, that would have been the right time to pound on the short
selling button. Or we could just buy a strangle at this point...</p>
<p>Since I entered pre-maturely on Monday, I'm going to wait this out
because the risk/reward ratio is still very high. At least now I know
\$115 would be my stop and my potential loss.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Once again, I find myself on the other side of the fence. I entered a
short at 10:42am today thinking the gap up is unsustainable. Well, not
only has S&amp;P500 broken 800, it's now resting above 820. Goldman Sachs
(GS) was about 106.50 when I entered the short. GS closed at 111.93
today. I'm down \$210 already. If GS can stay above this 200 day MA at
\$110 later tomorrow, then I'm out.</p>

<p>As you can see, GS went vertical upward once it broke the morning
resistance at \$17.30. The reason for my entry in the morning was
because GS seemed like it was having difficulty breaking \$17.
Furthermore, S&amp;P 500 also seemed hesitant around 800. So I guessed it'd
be reasonable to see a pullback.</p>
<p>However, I failed to take into account today's humongous gap up open. It
would have been counter-productive if we're to close the gap on the
weekend's hype up. This is pretty much a reverse of what we've seen
seeing for the past few months. Panic begets panic. But in today's case,
it's panic of missing the rally train that'll fuel this possibly new leg
of a rally.</p>
<p>My second mistake is trading on lack of information. I traded using the
mobile platform and by just looking at the Google Finance charts. If I
had access to my intraday sentiment chart, I could have easily seen that
the morning momentum remained strong even when S&amp;P was stalling around
800.</p>
<p>Lastly, I really should stick to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/market%20analysis/">my own analysis</a> and not trade on a
spontaneous urge. I did say in the morning that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/beginning-of-another-bull-phase-asian-markets-are-on-fire/">we'll break down if we
fail to maintain 800</a>. Even at the time of my short entry, we were
indeed holding on to the 800 zone. Thus, I have basically shot myself in
the foot for not listening to myself.</p> </div>
