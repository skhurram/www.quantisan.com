            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is my first real forex trade after <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-holding-on-to-intermediate-term-support-at-1-0868/">a year minus one day of
studying the market</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a>. Shorted USDCAD based on
the following intermarket observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yesterday's equities sell-off held around S&amp;P at 1050</li>
<li>Overnight Asian market seem orderly, not every market followed
    through, but most did</li>
<li>European markets down move were slow overnight until US open</li>
<li>But perhaps most importantly, EUR/USD made a higher low with an
    increasing COT</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, as much as the sell-off tries to scare off people, the
markets don't seem to be moving in unison. So it would seem this move
(in equities, thus inverse USD) is still a bear trap in an intermediate
term bull rally. Plus this daily chart, Figure 1, for picking USDCAD
specifically. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

0.05% of capital with a hard stop at 1.077. Anything above 1.070 would
put me on alert though. Coincidentally, I first got into the forex
market by studying the loonie. Let's see how this first trade performs.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Nowadays, computing power is practically free for trading. It does not
take much processing power to trade or chart on your computer. The
situation is even more wasteful for many mechanical traders obligated to
keep their computers on all the time. So what can you do with all that
idling power? Through World Community Grid (non-profit), you can help
develop new cures for diseases or discover affordable solar energy.
According to Wikipedia, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_community_grid">World Community Grid</a> (WCG) is an effort to
create the world's largest public computing grid to tackle scientific
research projects that benefit humanity." By joining WCG and installing
an open-source software, you are enabling your computer's idling cycles
to process data from various research projects as part of a cluster of
computers. From the <a href="http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/stat/viewGlobal.do">WCG statistics page</a>, over half a million users
have signed up. It is one of the three biggest non-profit grid computing
efforts in the world (the other being SETI@home and folding@home). I
tried <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETI@home">SETI@home</a> almost a decade ago to help search for E.T. But it
wasn't until the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home">folding@home</a> project started when grid computing
gained popularity. Tell people that you're leaving your computer on to
search for E.T. and people couldn't hold their laughs at you. But
telling people that you're leaving your computer on to find cures for
diseases ... then all of a sudden, it's philanthropic. The reasons why I
chose to devote my computer resources to WCG instead of the other two
are simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>It offers more than one projects to choose. You can fold proteins,
    find energy efficient material, simulate climate change, etc.</li>
<li>The projects offered have specific, realistic goals.</li>
<li>Projects do get completed (unlike SETI@home, for example, since no
    E.T. has been found yet after 10 years).</li>
<li>New projects are added as older ones finish.</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, that's just my personal choice. Take a look at the three
projects mentioned for more information. In addition, there's <a href="http://itnomad.wordpress.com/2010/05/19/a-better-rice-for-the-world/">an
interview with a researcher using WCG</a>. If you decide that WCG is
right for you, feel free to <a href="%20http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/reg/viewRegister.do?teamID=JQ7WNMDLX1">join Team Traders and start data crunching
together</a>. (Warning: Like any software, use at your own risk)</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Recent lack of actions in the market has given me opportunities to focus
less on the day-to-day market action and more on my own trading
development. Besides working on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative research</a>, one of the
tasks that I like to do is to review what I have thought previously in a
similar time. This takes us back to a year ago, August of 2009.
Headlines from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2009/08/">my fifteen posts back then</a> shows that I was trying
desperately (in hindsight) to short the market. Why would I do that?
Take a look at this 3-year long weekly chart of S&amp;P500.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="S&amp;P500 weekly
chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-08-18-SPX_wkly.png" />][][/caption] On the chart, August 2009 looked like a great
shorting opportunity. The resistance level at 1000 seem too good to be
true (it was). In fact, I said the following words on August 22, 2009:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been much talk of economic recovery and
a new bull market is already with us, I still am not convinced just
yet. True, the bears might be MIA. But all signs say that this bull
weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re seeing is standing on thin ice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How wrong I was. Since breaking the 1000 resistance back then, the S&amp;P
hitched on the bull train to steam upward steadily on to 1150 (Figure
1). It took a break there and continued on to 1207. Looking through my
trades back then, I eventually stopped shorting the market after S&amp;P
broke above 1025. That was the good part. The bad part is that I wasn't
able to change my view and remained stubbornly bearish (but at least
didn't commit to any new shorts) for weeks afterward. If I were to sum
up my lesson in the past year, here's what I would say to myself back in
August 2009.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trading is not about being right. It is about knowing when you are
wrong <em>and</em> doing something about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a final note, it was in August of last year that I started to paper
trade the forex market. I can't believe it has been a whole year
already!</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Proper position sizing is an integral part of risk management. It <em>can</em>
be one of the easiest thing to do too. For example, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/">typically size my
trading position</a> based on the following factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amount of capital willing to put at risk.</li>
<li>Stop price level.</li>
<li>Volatility of the instrument.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following JForex code calculates a lot size based on these three
factors. It is part of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sixth-place-finish-in-the-dukascopy-jforex-july-strategy-contest/">Dukascopy JForex July strategy</a> (complete
source code to the strategy is available via that link). [java
firstline="232"] private double getLot(Instrument instrument) throws
JFException { double riskAmt; double lotSize = 0; riskAmt =
this.acctEquity * (this.riskPct / 100d); // CCYUSD only lotSize =
riskAmt / (this.atr[instrument.ordinal()] * this.atrFactor); lotSize /=
1000000d; // in millions return roundLot(lotSize); } [/java] Referring
to line 237, riskAmt is the amount of capital to put at risk for a trade
(#1). Line 238 calculates lotSize, which is the position size that we
want. The denominator in that division is the distance of the stop in
pips. The strategy uses a multiple of ATR to set the stop loss. Nothing
fancy here. Lines 240--241 are to set the lotSize value according to the
JForex API specification. In which the lot amount is in millions and in
steps of a thousand units, or 0.001 step size. As I've noted in the
code, the caveat to this implementation is that the secondary currency
of the instrument and your account currency needs to be in U.S. dollar.
However, it's just a matter of conversion to extend this method for
other currencies. Update: I expanded on this functionality in the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">JFUtil open source project</a>.</p>

at 10 am today. I am mostly in cash again. I still have a small bullish
position in Kinross Gold. I'll just be letting it run its course. I have
no idea which way the market is going at this 1080 junction on the S&amp;P.

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update Aug 13: I got stopped out at \$15.80 for small loss. Precious
metals and the miners are holding well in today's 30 point drop in S&amp;P
(<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704901104575422901187797266.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection">WSJ article</a>). In particular, gold just made a higher low (Figure 1)
and AUD/USD is holding 0.8900 somewhat. As such, I've lowered my mental
stop on the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-paa-to-10dec-puts-25-00-2-27-mark-24-75/">PAA.TO short</a> to \$24.30, a mere few cents above.
Secondly, I am taking a long position in the Kinross Gold Corp. (K.TO).</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"
caption="Gold"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-08-11-Gold.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>As evident in Figure 2, Kinross has been taking a beating the past year.
However, it is trading on a long term Fibonacci support level around
\$15.80. Thus, I am buying here with a small position while Kinross is
making higher lows intraday and on the daily (so far).</p>
<p>I have set a mental stop at \$15.60 and a hard stop at \$15.50.</p>
<p>Risk is (\$15.94-\$15.50) * 200 = \$88 + \$9.90 commission = \$97.9 =
1% of account.</p>
