            <div class="article-content"> <p>Recent lack of actions in the market has given me opportunities to focus
less on the day-to-day market action and more on my own trading
development. Besides working on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative research</a>, one of the
tasks that I like to do is to review what I have thought previously in a
similar time. This takes us back to a year ago, August of 2009.
Headlines from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2009/08/">my fifteen posts back then</a> shows that I was trying
desperately (in hindsight) to short the market. Why would I do that?
Take a look at this 3-year long weekly chart of S&amp;P500.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="S&amp;P500 weekly
chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-08-18-SPX_wkly.png" />][][/caption] On the chart, August 2009 looked like a great
shorting opportunity. The resistance level at 1000 seem too good to be
true (it was). In fact, I said the following words on August 22, 2009:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been much talk of economic recovery and
a new bull market is already with us, I still am not convinced just
yet. True, the bears might be MIA. But all signs say that this bull
weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re seeing is standing on thin ice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How wrong I was. Since breaking the 1000 resistance back then, the S&amp;P
hitched on the bull train to steam upward steadily on to 1150 (Figure
1). It took a break there and continued on to 1207. Looking through my
trades back then, I eventually stopped shorting the market after S&amp;P
broke above 1025. That was the good part. The bad part is that I wasn't
able to change my view and remained stubbornly bearish (but at least
didn't commit to any new shorts) for weeks afterward. If I were to sum
up my lesson in the past year, here's what I would say to myself back in
August 2009.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trading is not about being right. It is about knowing when you are
wrong <em>and</em> doing something about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a final note, it was in August of last year that I started to paper
trade the forex market. I can't believe it has been a whole year
already!</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Proper position sizing is an integral part of risk management. It <em>can</em>
be one of the easiest thing to do too. For example, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/">typically size my
trading position</a> based on the following factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amount of capital willing to put at risk.</li>
<li>Stop price level.</li>
<li>Volatility of the instrument.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following JForex code calculates a lot size based on these three
factors. It is part of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sixth-place-finish-in-the-dukascopy-jforex-july-strategy-contest/">Dukascopy JForex July strategy</a> (complete
source code to the strategy is available via that link). [java
firstline="232"] private double getLot(Instrument instrument) throws
JFException { double riskAmt; double lotSize = 0; riskAmt =
this.acctEquity * (this.riskPct / 100d); // CCYUSD only lotSize =
riskAmt / (this.atr[instrument.ordinal()] * this.atrFactor); lotSize /=
1000000d; // in millions return roundLot(lotSize); } [/java] Referring
to line 237, riskAmt is the amount of capital to put at risk for a trade
(#1). Line 238 calculates lotSize, which is the position size that we
want. The denominator in that division is the distance of the stop in
pips. The strategy uses a multiple of ATR to set the stop loss. Nothing
fancy here. Lines 240--241 are to set the lotSize value according to the
JForex API specification. In which the lot amount is in millions and in
steps of a thousand units, or 0.001 step size. As I've noted in the
code, the caveat to this implementation is that the secondary currency
of the instrument and your account currency needs to be in U.S. dollar.
However, it's just a matter of conversion to extend this method for
other currencies. Update: I expanded on this functionality in the

no idea which way the market is going at this 1080 junction on the S&amp;P.

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update Aug 13: I got stopped out at \$15.80 for small loss. Precious
metals and the miners are holding well in today's 30 point drop in S&amp;P
(<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704901104575422901187797266.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection">WSJ article</a>). In particular, gold just made a higher low (Figure 1)
and AUD/USD is holding 0.8900 somewhat. As such, I've lowered my mental
stop on the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-paa-to-10dec-puts-25-00-2-27-mark-24-75/">PAA.TO short</a> to \$24.30, a mere few cents above.
Secondly, I am taking a long position in the Kinross Gold Corp. (K.TO).</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"
caption="Gold"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-08-11-Gold.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>As evident in Figure 2, Kinross has been taking a beating the past year.
However, it is trading on a long term Fibonacci support level around
\$15.80. Thus, I am buying here with a small position while Kinross is
making higher lows intraday and on the daily (so far).</p>
<p>I have set a mental stop at \$15.60 and a hard stop at \$15.50.</p>
<p>Risk is (\$15.94-\$15.50) * 200 = \$88 + \$9.90 commission = \$97.9 =
1% of account.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>While the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-dual-timeframe-moving-averages-setup/">dual-timeframe trading setup</a> and much of the algorithm in
my contest strategy are for competition only (read: not for use with
real money) as I've warned numerous times, some of the risk management
techniques used there are really what I use in real life. This being one
of them. There's a saying in trading that "never let profits turns into
losses." That is exactly the motivation behind this JForex code snippet.
The following source code are excerpts from my <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> JForex
contest's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sixth-place-finish-in-the-dukascopy-jforex-july-strategy-contest/">July strategy</a>. The complete source code file is available
in that link. Back to this concept of not letting profits turn to
losses. This is a matter of balancing between giving room for your trade
to reach its potential and limiting your drawdown. If you're too
careful, you may find yourself being whipsawed out before a price move
can materialize. If you keep your leash too loose though, well, you may
watch your profits turn into losses. The way I intrepret the saying is
that once your trade is profitable enough, you shouldn't let it slip
back into a loss. I implement the above statement in my automated
strategy as follows. Note that everything goes in the onTick() method so
that it watches your position on every tick. The line numbers correspond
to the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sixth-place-finish-in-the-dukascopy-jforex-july-strategy-contest/">complete source code</a> of my automated strategy.
[java firstline="177"] boolean isLong; double open, stop, diff, newStop;
for (IOrder order : engine.getOrders(instrument)) { if (order.getState()
== IOrder.State.FILLED) { [/java] [java firstline="191"] isLong =
order.isLong(); open = order.getOpenPrice(); stop =
order.getStopLossPrice(); diff = (open - stop); // *********
BREAKEVEN *********************** if (isLong &amp;&amp;
diff > 0 &amp;&amp; tick.getBid() > (open + diff)) {
order.close(roundLot(order.getAmount() * beRatio)); // close a portion
newStop = open + instrument.getPipValue() * LOCKPIP;
order.setStopLossPrice(newStop); print(order.getLabel() + ": Moved STOP
to breakeven"); } else if (!isLong &amp;&amp; diff \&lt; 0 &amp;&amp; tick.getAsk() \&lt;
(open + diff)) { order.close(roundLot(order.getAmount() * beRatio));
newStop = open - (instrument.getPipValue() * LOCKPIP);
order.setStopLossPrice(newStop); print(order.getLabel() + ": Moved STOP
to breakeven"); } [/java] What this does is that it will partially exit
a position and move the stop to breakeven once the price is
equidistantly positive from your initial stop loss. For example, if my
stop loss is 100 pips, then once the position is 100 pips <em>in profit</em>,
it will exit partially and set the new stop to breakeven. Update: This
is now integrated into the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">JFUtil open source project</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This post describes the setup for my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sixth-place-finish-in-the-dukascopy-jforex-july-strategy-contest/">Dukascopy JForex automated trading
strategy in July</a>. Note that this strategy is built for competing in a
contest and not for real trading (i.e., its purely a
no cost gamble). Here is the step by step process of the setup for a
long position:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the current trend by the relative position of current
    price to its moving average <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-multiple-time-frame-strategy/">in a higher time frame</a>. In
    particular, a price above the moving average in the higher time
    frame is deemed as bullish.</li>
<li>Entry: Price moves above a moving average in the current time frame
    (red line in Figure 1) with a higher high, low, and close (HLC). As
    illustrated in Figure 1, the two bars circled.</li>
<li>Exit: Crossing below a regular moving average (blue dotted line).</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="EURUSD setup" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-19-EURUSD.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the setup itself is simple. Less than a fifth of the
source code is devoted to the entry and exit. Most of this strategy
involves <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-automatic-position-sizing/">automated position sizing</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-not-letting-profit-turn-to-losses-with-a-breakeven-stop/">risk management to not let profits turn into losses</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sixth-place-finish-in-the-dukascopy-jforex-july-strategy-contest/">complete source code of this strategy</a> is available in the introductory post.</p> </div>
