                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/" rel='bookmark'>January 2010 Trading Performance Review</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>2010 didn't begin well for me. I experienced my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/first-2010-trading-drawdown-analysis-on-the-verge-of-a-new-record/">biggest drawdown</a> so
far at -3.95% (see Figure 1 for my account balance graph) in my demo
account. Given that I only risk 0.2% per trade, this is a relatively
substantial setback. Ironically, I was in the process of filling paper
work to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">open a live account</a> when this performance setback hit me.
Change of plan. Now I'll have to postpone live trading until I can at
least recover my demo account balance. To do that, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/work-harder-trade-fewer-in-a-long-and-excruciating-trading-drawdown/">tightened up</a> my
risk exposure and focused on playing only <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">my best setup</a>. By the
close of the month, my demo account is sitting at -1.2% for January. At
least I have made it some way from the bottom with a few <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">good
trades</a>. This is also the first negative month for me since beginning
trading forex in September, just 4 months ago.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="January 2010
Demo Account Balance"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/january_2010_account_balance.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Aside from my performance, a notable change this month for my trading is
the fact that I've been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/barred-from-trading-at-work-a-curse-or-a-gift/">barred from trading during the day</a>. This
forced me to trade less, which is a good thing. On the other hand, I'm
not able to manage my stops as often as I would have liked. As such,
I've been helpless at times and watched some profitable positions <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-gbpjpy-144-24-stop-143-60-target-148/">turn
sour</a>. Whereas before, I would have at least moved my stops to
breakeven when the price moved away enough. Obviously, this calls for a
drastic change to my current trading strategy. For one, I'm looking at
higher timeframes for my trading now to catch slower moves. Secondly, my
top priority for the next few months is to develop some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">trading bots</a>
to manage my risks while I'm away.</p>

<h2>Goal for February</h2>
<p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/december-2009-trading-performance-review/">goal from the previous month</a> is to think more and trade less.
Well, I managed the latter part but the former still requires work as
evident by my negative return this month. For February, my strategy is
to keep trading with half the risk exposure (i.e. 0.1% per trade) to
recover my account back to its all-time high in beginning of January.
I'm just about 2% away at this moment. My goal for February is to get
acquinted with MQL4 so that I can begin to develop expert advisors to
manage my risks during the day and overnight.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
One of the frontpage stories in my local newspaper today tells the tale
of how a [Deadly crash shattered teacher's life][]. A young couple is
left permanently paralyzed for one and crippled for the other. All
because of "brazen and aggressive" driving of two other drivers. Alan
Kippax was racing with his cousin Peter Kippax on the street. Peter lost
control of his Porsche and crashed into the aforementioned young
couple's Pontiac. Peter died in the crash and Alan was sentenced to be
guilty of his contribution in this tragedy. While this is certainly a
sad news, unfortunately, it isn't rare either. And what does it have to
do on my trading blog? You see, it is actually the last line of the
article that really caught my attention.

> Kippax, who used to run an emerald marketing network, Ontario Treasure
> Traders International, is global sales manager for Business In Motion.

Business In Motion. That rings a bell in my head. Exactly a year ago,
[CBC News aired an investigative journal][] on this company. In the
show, PSA President Robert L. FitzPatrick concludes:

> BIM is a blatant pyramid scam which ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ by its design
> ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ will inflict losses on 90+% of all consumers who
> are ensnared. from Pyramid Scheme Alert

Alan Kippax (the one alive) was never charged or questioned in Canada
regarding BIM. Even though he was convicted of fraud by the government
of England in another pyramid scheme and in lieu of overwhelming
evidence against him and BIM here in Canada. It is sad that it takes
another tragedy to bring to justice another tragedy. Yet, I find it
incredibly just that at least one more financial scam has come to an
end, although in an unfortunate manner. As for Kippax. I feel no remorse
for him. A loved one dies in his face and he's left alive to bear the
consequences of his crime (not to the full extent, but still) in prison.
How fitting is that for a scammer? (Yes, I am evil.) My questions are,
why are there still so many financial scams out there, right in our
backyards, in this so-called information age? Is our government
deliberately turning a blind eye or are they really that incompetent?
How many more [Madoff cases][] will it take for us to wake up to this
problem?

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p><strong>Update:</strong> I've switched over to long EURJPY @ 125.40 as EURGBP's
downtrend seem to be running out of steam. Moreover, EURJPY looks better
on the daily chart with a clear support and an oversold reading. I'm
back in my long GBPJPY play at 145.24. The currency pair is breaking an
hourly resistance since consolidating around 145. I had a low ball offer
at 144.20 since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-gbpjpy-146-42-for-140-pips/">taking my profit last night at 146.42</a>. But that bid
for never filled. So I'm re-entering on a short-term breakout. For this
entry, I am risking 0.1% of my account. This re-entry is a tough
decision. Almost all the respectable pros that I <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Quantisan">follow on Twitter</a>
are on the other side of this trade via other currency pairs. However,
my long setup is valid as long as GBPJPY is above 144 level. So I'll
take this trade until proven otherwise. Although I must admit that my
confidence in this trade is very low. I also considered long CADJPY
instead as it seems to offer more upside potential. However, as I've
been following the GBPJPY pair this week, I'll stick with my plan. I
also have a limit order to add more at 145.81 as you can see in Figure 1
below.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Just closed my GBPJPY long at 146.42 for around +140 pips average gain,
or 0.4% in the account balance. Damn good for a 24 hours holding. Obama
just finished his State of The Union address at the moment. I am not
impressed. Still all talk of change but nothing concrete yet. Anyway,
that's beside the point in this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>. 146.50 price level for
GBPJPY is the 10 day moving average. It has also been a strong support
back in late December. This should be a good resistance level. My guess
is that GBPJPY should stall, or even retrace, here for a while. Thus I'm
taking profit at this price as shown in Figure 1 (yellow triangle). I
still believe my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-gbpjpy-144-24-stop-143-60-target-148/">bullish setup from yesterday</a> is still good. So I'll
be watching this pair for a re-entry. Update: I re-entered at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-gbpjpy-145-24-stop-144-70-target-148/">145.24
the next day</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My previous <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-gbpjpy-146-32-target-143/">short-side setup on GBP/JPY</a> played out beautifully. Yet
I wasn't able to ride it down because I got stopped out on a stop-hunt
counter-move before the dive, see Fig. 1. Now that GBP/JPY has reached
its other end. I am betting for it to go reverse with a long position. I
expect this move to be more fierce with more upside potential as it's in
the direction of the long term up trend. Some people are calling the top
has been printed in the markets and the wind is now blowing the other
way. I am not one to guess what the market is about to do. So it's
business as usual until the trendline is broken. What I really like
about this setup is that GBP/JPY is testing a double trendline cross on
the weekly, Fig. 2. Secondly, the 3-hour chart of Figure 1 is showing a
RSI positive divergence on this test of the long term support. I am
quite confident of this setup. However, I am not confident about the
timing as GBP/JPY is known to be a wild horse and volatility could very
well stop me out, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-gbpjpy-146-32-target-143/">like last time</a>. With
British preliminary GDP number coming out in about 6 hours, it might
have been wiser to wait until the after that to enter. On top of that,
the markets have been on a stall for the last few days waiting for data
in the next 48 hours. End-of-week volatility this week is expected to be
significant. Anyway, I've put in a position already and will just let it
run. This a small initial position with 0.1% of my account at risk. I
have also placed limit orders above resistances to add to this position.
We'll how this turns out soon enough. Lastly, even though I said I've
been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/barred-from-trading-at-work-a-curse-or-a-gift/">cut off from trading at my day job</a>. It doesn't mean I'm
completely out of the game. I just have to adapt my manual trading
strategy while my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated system</a> is still in development.
Basically meaning that I'll trade with a slower timeframe for
longer-term moves. All the better, as longer term moves are generally
less deceptive. Update: I closed this at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-gbpjpy-146-42-for-140-pips/">146.42 for +140 pips gain</a>
the next day.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well, they've done it. The IT guys at my day job have blocked access to
streaming market data. I can't trade at lunch anymore or even doodle on
charts! Yet, this event merely pushes my agenda forward as I've never
intended to trade actively at work (i.e. no intention of getting myself
fired). Although I have honestly been pushing my luck these weeks. For
the longest time, I've traded <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/stocks/">stocks</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/options/">options</a>, and even dabbled
in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures</a> (not while at work!). On a whim in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2009/09/">September 2009</a>, I
decided to try out the foreign exchange markets with a demo account just
to see what the fuzz is about. Since then I have not looked back... Nah!
But no, trading stocks still remain my main staple. I am just curious
about forex and it never hurts to broaden my understanding of the
capital market. I must admit though, forex suits my trading style. I
fully intend to incorporate it in my portfolio in the long run. So what
is my plan about forex trading? What do I want to achieve with my
obsessive <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> lately? My paper trading objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">trading weaknesses</a></li>
<li>Identify my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">strengths</a></li>
<li>Experiment with various <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading signals</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">strategies</a></li>
<li>Get a <em>feel</em> of trading the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex market</a></li>
<li>Understand the dynamics between currencies</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd be a fool to claim that I have achieved my objectives. Trading is a
never-ending learning process. This is nothing but the first stage in my
forex trading sojourn. The next stage now, as I have intended from the
beginning, is to automate some trading processes from what I've learned.
Such that I can remain active in the markets even when I am not around.
Not for more profits, but to reduce risks. This need became blatantly
obvious to me as some of my positions were left running through Asia and
early Europe. Profits were sometimes turned into losses. If only my
stops were moved. Fortunately, the vigorous paper trading in the past
few months does have its advantage. It has given me ideas for 3 new
trading systems. I have disclosed one concept with my post on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC
setup</a>. As I was saying, being blocked from trading at work merely
pushes my agenda forward. I haven't touched a single line of code for 5
months. Now I have no choice but to work on developing some
semi-<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading systems</a> to continue my forex paper trading.
My ultimate goal is to let myself do the high-level decision making,
such as which pair to trade, which side of the position, and when. Then
let loose a simple algorithmic trading system to take care of the timing
for entries and exits, and some basic <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex
trading</a> life continues.</p>
