<p>The possible folding of Citigroup is creating another wave of panic on
the market today. As the second biggest bank in America, this is unlike
the collapse of Lehman, WaMu, Fannie and Freddie. While the previous
institutions are also gigantic financial institutions and an integral
part of the financial system, Citigroup is different because it's a part
of the daily lives of many Americans. While I am not an economist, but I
am a consumer. I <em>personally</em> feel this is psychologically a bigger
deal.</p>
<p>However, is this a time to panic? Perhaps. But from a trader's
standpoint, I think we would be a little too late now. In hindsight,
anyone would have wished to unload the financials back in 2007. But who
am I kidding, I definitely don't have that foresight.</p>
<p>What I do notice though, is that the failed retest of \$10 for C last
Friday and this Monday was a pretty good sign that C is going down. A
failed retest of the \$8.5 level on Tuesday and Wednesday was a
confirmation. I tried to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-325/">short C</a> then but was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-350/">stopped out</a>.
Frankly, I didn't think it would be <em>this</em> bad (my target was \$7).</p>
<p>Since then, Citigroup and the market continued to decline at an
accelerated pace. Rather this is simply a case of correlation or
causality is unknown by me. It doesn't matter. The point is, even an
amateur like me saw C to be going down on Wednesday. Do you think the
professionals would have missed it? Wouldn't they know already C would
be <em>going down in flames</em>? And probably months ago too!</p>
<p>I think it's good to assume that the current panic on Citigroup trading
below the magical \$5 has been factored in the market already. So am I
saying we'll be making a reversal soon? Not really. C trading below \$5
is one thing, but there's also the bigger picture we should consider.
Would this trigger a new leg of this bear run due to a vicious spiral of
panic? Don't forget, we have recently <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-breakdown-of-a-major-multi-year-support-are-we-going-down-and-i-mean-really-down/">broken some multi-year
supports</a>. This leg of the market downturn <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/pre-market-analysis-for-november-21-2008/">still haven't eased off
yet</a>.</p>
<p>Yes we may be going down, but I believe the time for panic was over,
this is a time for finding values and positioning yourself for the
longer term (hey, it has to go up <em>some</em> time, right?). I wouldn't dare
short this market though, even a target of 600 on the S&amp;P is just 150
points away, but look at the S&amp;P chart on any time frame and you can see
the vast green pasture to the upside. The risk/reward potential just
isn't that good for a short here.</p>
<p>I believe I have learned my lesson. There is no profit in calling for
bottoms. I will wait for the market to play it out and watch the price
action for entries.</p>

<p>I have covered my FSLR Jan09 70 put as planned. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1320/">shorted it for
\$13.2</a> and covered it for \$11.90. An overnight profit of \$130 after
commission. The share price was about \$92 at the time of this trade. It
is now at \$88 as I type a few minutes later. I covered at a good time,
right at the peak of this morning gap up rush. Frankly, I'm just glad I
can cover it at a profit. I would have done the same even if it's a
loss. Better be small than big.</p>
<p>I believe my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1320/">original reasons for going long</a>
were sound for the <em>long</em> term, but I obtusely forget the fact that I
can't stand a huge potential drawdown. I am clearly still suffering from
this bottom-calling tendency. But at least I caught myself this time. I
think this is a good start to correct this costly habit.</p>
<p>Looking at the trend in this week's down leg indicate we can have a
downside to \$80 for ESLR. Entering long at yeseterday was a low
probability trade. I should have waited til \$80 or better yet, wait for
a confirmation for a rally.</p>

<p>Option expiration Friday is finally here! After <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1320/">yesterday's horrific
day</a>, everyone is expecting a reversal today. Indeed, the market
futures are up overnight. S&amp;P futures broke 780 overnight and is holding
at around 765. We are probably going to open with a gap up in the market
and make an intraday rally from there. However, I wouldn't be chasing
this rally just yet. As you can see from Figure 1, we are merely
retracing the recent plunge back to the downtrend from earlier in the
week. S&amp;P 500 at 780 will be a resistance for today. 750 will be its
support. At 765, notice that we have 15 more upside points versus 15
down. This is not a good risk/reward at all.</p>
<p>Based on the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/stock-move-estimation-expiration-day-based-on-option-prices/">option pricing estimation method</a>, the S&amp;P is expected
to move within 40 points today.</p>
<p>One indicator to watch for a rally with follow through is the US Dollar
Index. As <a href="http://www.billcara.com">Bill</a> opined (yes, I read his blog religiously), \$USD will
fall if the sideline money are moving into equity. That will be the
source of a good rally. From Figure 2 below, you can see that the US
Dollar Index has dropped a bit. Yet, it is holding on at the 200 hour
bar moving average and a minor support from the recent trend. I would
like to see it breaks below 87.5 and stays there for at least an hour
before proclaiming a hold-able rally.</p>

<p>Another item of note is the rise of the precious metals. Gold has broken
the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-out-of-a-month-long-trading-range-for-gold-and-silver/">month-long triangle</a> to the upside. That's a good sign. Figure 4
shows that it has broken its hourly resistance too. We'll see if gold
can hold that gain or would this be a fake breakout of the triangle.</p>
<p>I am leaning towards nibbling at the market today on the long side with
small positions. If we see confirmation, then add slowly to the bullish
positions.</p>

<p>After breaking the 820 support on the S&amp;P 500 2 days ago, the market
dived into the abyss today as I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-breakdown-of-a-major-multi-year-support-are-we-going-down-and-i-mean-really-down/">suggested this morning</a>. Frankly, the
mid-day looked alright and I thought we wouldn't go down anymore.</p>
<p>Turns out I was wrong (I stayed on sideline as planned). The market
capitulated in the last hour. In particular, Citigroup sank to \$4.71.
My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-325/">short call at \$8.20</a> would have made a killing had I not get
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-350/">stopped out</a>. Oh well, I'm not complaining. Although my portfolio is
way down, I am just glad that I managed my risk and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-195/">covered all my
short puts</a> a couple of days ago. In hindsight though, I really should
have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-325/">hedged my position</a> more eagerly.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to this entry. Why? After failing to pick the bottom so
many times, why the heck am I entering now? (This is going in my rule
book, <strong>no picking top/bottom</strong>)</p>
<p>Do I think this is the bottom for FSLR? I don't know. Why did I enter
this trade? Because if offers good risk/reward and probability.</p>
<p>Upside: January 2009 expiry date with 50% probability of expiry for this
70 strike. Support is \$75 for FSLR set in 2007 but we never even came
close to it in this historic downleg in the market. Today marked a new
low of \$86. Thus, my 70 strike is a stink bid. And being paid \$13.20
for this stink bid? I compared this risk/reward to a few strong
companies I liked and this OTM put price is the highest (since I'm
shorting).</p>
<p>Resistance: \$100. But I don't really care since this is a stink bid and
I have limited upside.</p>
<p>Downside: If we do break \$75, then all hell breaks lose in this. We are
still in a severe and monumental market crash. I don't have cash to buy
the shares if this is put to me in January.</p>
<p>Support: \$75.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is a high probability trade. Stop is just below \$75.</p>
<p>
**Update:** I am going to liquidate this position tomorrow. Bill from
[BillCara.com kindly shared his insight][] on this trade.

I also didn't think this thoroughly myself. I simply cannot stomach the
potential drawdown in FSLR. Even my own trendline analysis shows it can
go to \$80 on this down run. I should wait for confirmations of strength
before heading in at this point.
