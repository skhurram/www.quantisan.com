            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just finished porting <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/quantised-trading-desk/">Quantised Trading Desk</a> to Metatrader 4. So
that I can make use of my dormant trading account at Oanda. Seeing that
Oanda has enabled use of Metatrader 4, I thought I might <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">give them a
second try</a>. I've always preferred to have more than one active
trading accounts to serve as a backup and comparison. I settled on
Questrade and TD Waterhouse for stocks and options, after hopping around
brokerages for years. And I've been using Dukascopy to trade forex
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/in-a-forex-brokers-and-trading-platforms-jumble/">after much contention</a>. This is a good chance to diversify as I don't
want to pigeonhole myself into one broker and one platform. The move to
Metatrader 4 up until this point only took a couple of weeks as opposed
to JForex version's year-long development time. This is because the
underlying QTD system dynamics and algorithms were ironed out in JForex.
I don't think I can finish QTD if I only had MQL4 at my disposal.
Debugging and extending MQL4 scripts are a nightmare to say the least. I
am so glad that I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">moved away from these "easy" languages</a>. For the
MQL4 version of QTD, I am merely doing a direct source code port from
JForex to MQL4. MQL4, if anything else, is a very easy scripting
language. I just taped out an alpha version of MT4 QTD this weekend as
it is up to a stage where it is functional. However, porting QTD to MQL4
isn't without its difficulties. For one, MQL4 is tailored for simple
trading with technical analysis indicators. If price move above moving
average, go long, for example. Whereas QTD rely on statistics and
numerical methods in its trading algorithm. As such, I had to go back to
basics and define all of my numerical methods from the fundamentals. I
am now moving on to do forward testing on the MT4 QTD to ensure that
both the JForex and the MT4 versions work similarly. I can't wait til I
can run QTD on Dukascopy and Oanda simultaneously.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703864204576317060246641834.html">case of Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam</a> shows a corporate
security crack that shouldn't happen in this day and age. In the
Rajaratnam case, government wiretaps served as vital evidence against
him. The question though, is that, if the government is able to do that
on a multi-billion dollar company without them knowing, what about their
competitors or enemies with ill-intent? With all the resources available
to them, how can something so old-school like this happen to a hedge
fund? Secrecy and conspiracy shouldn't be unfamiliar in the hedge fund
industry. So I had assumed that they operated inside an iron wall.
Government wiretapping or corporate espionage are certainly not my
worry. However, I still try to employ prudent security procedures in the
financial quantitative research and development that I do at Quantisan
Systems just because I value my intellectual property. For example, in
my email correspondence with business associates, I make use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a>
with a 2048-bit RSA asynchronous key pair. (my public key is below) GPG
is an open-source equivalent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">Pretty Good Privacy</a>. It is most
likely that your email client supports it too. I use Thunderbird and it
is a built-in feature. You just need to enable it and set it up. On
voice communications, I prefer to use Skype rather than regular voice
calls because it's free and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_security">Skype inherently uses 256-bit AES
encryption</a>. So no setup is even required for this added security. For
my important files, I place them in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt">TrueCrypt volume</a> encrypted
with 256-bit AES encryption. The encrypted container is synchronized to
my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTYwMjg4MDY5/">Dropbox</a> account so that I can use it anywhere while ensuring
security. TrueCrypt is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It's only a
matter of following the installation instructions to safeguard your
files from prying eyes. All of these encryption tools are open-source
and free. I configured them to work in the background and they don't
hinder my work flow at all. It is certainly not a sophisticated setup,
yet it isn't too dingy either. At the very least, if someone is to steal
my notebook computer, an ordinary crook wouldn't be able to gain access
to my sensitive information. In view of the fact that Quantisan Systems
is just an one-man operation with practically no resource available, I
can't believe security at some financial companies is worse than this
homebrew setup. -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Version: GnuPG

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been looking for a cheap but reliable virtual private server (VPS)
to run my trading program for the last few months. I ran my QTD program
on 3 remote servers in UK and Germany in April for an entire month as
performance testing. One in UK on a Xen cloud. One in Germany on OpenVZ.
And a last one also in UK on KVM technology. This post is a summary of
my initial findings on what to watch for when choosing a server provider
for running a remote trading server. Keep in mind that this is for
low-end, low-frequency, retail trading. Where latencies in the range of
tens of milliseconds are considered good. General target price range is
US\$10 - \$20 per month for an unmanaged server with 512MB of ram and
600MHz-equivalent of circa 2006 Intel CPU. Low price is the primary
consideration here. If you don't care for the technical details, the top
VPS names are <a href="http://www.linode.com">Linode</a>, <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en/">Hetzner</a>, and <a href="http://www.6sync.com">6sync</a> for Linux-based
VPSs. Linode offers Xen VPSs in US and UK. 6sync offers KVM VPSs in US
only. Both companies offer Linux-based 512MB instances for \$20 as a
starter server. Hetzner offers KVM VPSs in Germany for €7.90. Cloud
servers like Amazon EC2 and Rackspace Cloud are too expensive for
running 24/7.</p>
<h2>Location, Location, Location</h2>
<p>Use a datacenter that's at least in the same sub-continent as your
broker's datacenter. You wouldn't want your data to travel half-way
around the world just to save a few bucks. It adds unnecessary latency
and prices are comparable in either the states or Europe nowadays.
Although Asia is another story. If you use more than one broker, you can
use multiple servers or pick a server location that sits between them on
the internet backbone. TeleGeography provides <a href="http://www.telegeography.com/telecom-resources/map-gallery/index.html">global internet maps</a>
to identify best locations. I trade with Dukascopy and Oanda. One in
Switzerland and another in the states. As such, Internet hubs in cities
like New York, London, and Frankfurt are prime targets for low latency
between both brokers. As I trade more at Dukascopy, I'm biased to
European servers. Furthermore, London and Frankfurt are the #1 and #2
internet hub in the world. London has 7,723 Gbps and Frankfurt has 7,218
Gbps capacity in 2010. Whereas New York, 5th in the world, has 3,850
Gbps.</p>
<h2>Virtualization Technologies</h2>
<p>Virtual private servers are merely reserved resource chunks of a
computer in a datacenter. This is achieved through the use of
virtualization technologies. And there are quite many of those as I have
discovered. Here are three that you'll likely hear about in your search.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>OpenVZ.</strong> This is the most popular and least preferred platform
    for trading servers. It's often used by budget hosts because
    resources between virtualized instances are not well isolated. As
    such, a host can oversell a server's resource as most webapps have
    sporadic resource utilization trend. In other worlds, it is unlikely
    all the virtual private servers would demand their maximum allocated
    resources at the same time. However, trading servers require a
    consistent and guaranteed level of computing resource. So stay away
    from VPS that runs on OpenVZ unless you want to see server hiccups.</li>
<li><strong>Xen.</strong> This is what Amazon EC2 and Rackspace Cloud runs on. Xen
    offers true resource isolation so that you're less likely affected
    by your virtual server's neighbours. What you see is also what you
    get. So if you're promised 512MB of memory, you'll get 512MB of
    memory. However, processing power varies tremendously across
    different VPS providers. A micro instance on Amazon EC2 offers 613MB
    of memory, for example. But it is no match for even a 256MB instance
    on Rackspace Cloud. I was able to run a LXDE desktop GUI plus a java
    program on Rackspace but couldn't do it on Amazon.</li>
<li><strong>KVM.</strong> KVM uses the Linux kernel to virtualize. It's said to offer
    lower overhead to the host server so that it can provide better
    value than Xen. Like Xen, it offers true resource isolation.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, either Xen or KVM are good but stay away from OpenVZ.</p>
<h2>Operating System</h2>
<p>Key question here is: Linux or Windows? If you're unfamiliar with Linux
and is not interesting in learning about it, use a Windows Server 2003
or 2008 provider. Windows Server 2003 is preferred as it uses fewer
resources just to run so it's cheaper. Do note that Windows VPSs are
\$10-\$20 more expensive anyway because you have to pay for a monthly
license lease. With the use of a Windows-based VPS, you can connect to
your server through the remote desktop protocol (RDP). It's just a
matter of running the Remote Desktop application on your local machine
to your remote server. Then you'll see the remote machine's desktop on
your own machine. And then you can control the remote server just like
any other Windows computer. Very simple. However, I prefer to run Linux
because of its renowned stability and lower cost. The downside is that
you need to know what you're doing to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">tweak the server for trading</a>.
Linux uses very little computing resource to run. I can squeeze JForex
and Metatrader together on a Linux VPS with only 256MB memory. By
comparison, you need at least 512MB on a Windows box just to get the OS
running. And there's no licensing fee for Linux too. A double savings.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>When choosing a VPS provider, consider factors such as location,
virtualization technology, and operating system(s) offered. Once you've
narrowed your search to a shortlist of providers, the next step is to
compare their specific VPS offerings by looking at price, services, and
technical specifications.</p>
