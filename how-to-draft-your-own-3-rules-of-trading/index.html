    </h1>

    <div class='article-content'>
        <p>If you decide to write your own trading rules. Here's an explanation of
how I came about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">my 3 trading rules</a> and the reasoning behind them.
So why only 3 trading rules? There are several reasons for it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy to remember.</li>
<li>Easy to follow.</li>
<li>Easy to learn.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I've said in my 3 rules page, this list is not intended to be written
in stone. You are expected to progress from being restrained by it, to
being familiar with it, and then to being habitual with it. Thus, a
short list makes it easy to remember, to follow, and to learn. Once any
rule become an unconscious competency, you will not need it anymore and
it can be adapted or changed to address your new needs. Besides the
benefit of keeping it short, there's another reason why I'm using 3
rules. The three rules actually address my biggest trading <strong>weaknesses
in the past, present, and future</strong>. This is also the answer to this
post's title, how to draft your own 3 rules of trading. Let's get right
to it. The first rule is to tackle my archilles' heel, the bane of my
trading, based on my trading history. It is the single most important
thing that when I looked back and analysed my trades in the past few
months, or even years, which would have made my trading better. It could
be a trading strategy tweak, a trading psychology note-to-self, or a
risk management rule. Anything goes. And if that didn't really help,
consider using a popular hypothetical scenario, if you can go back in
time, what would you have told yourself back then to improve your
trading? The second rule is derived from asking the question, what is
the most important thing that I can do
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">now</span> with all of my
trades to increase my odds in this game? Let's use a hypothetical again.
Imagine that there is a trading guru here trading with you now and
watching you trade, what would s/he tell you? The last rule is to
address the future. What can you do in the times to come that can make
the most difference in your trading? What is this next step you can take
that will start the wheel going on your journey to becoming the trader
that you want to be? Whatever your trading rules are, the <strong>most
important rule</strong> about drafting your own trading rules is to be as
specific as you can. Vague or unclear rules are worse than useless
because they can give a false sense of security. Consider these three
#3 rules about the same idea. I want to ...</p>
<ol>
<li>Improve on my trades.</li>
<li>Improve on my trades by studying my trading history.</li>
<li>Improve on my trades by studying any trade with performance
    statistics beyond the middle 50% quartile.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll let you be the judge on which style you prefer. If you didn't read
any of the above, remember this, the most important rule (yes, I lied
above) for drafting your trading rules is to just write them down and
follow them. No matter what you wrote, you will eventually find ways to
improve on it if you are diligent about them. So just start somewhere
and go with it.</p>
