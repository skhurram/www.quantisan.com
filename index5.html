            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just migrated this blog from a self-hosted Wordpress site to a Pelican statically generated blog. It took me a whole weekend to do it because I have almost 600 posts. Much is still broken at the moment but at least the site seems presentable so I pushed it through. The fixes will just have to wait.</p>
<p>I considered using Jekyll as it appears to be the most popular static site generator. A look at its github page though shows no patch has been made for months. Development on Jekyll appears to have paused for some reason. Furthermore, I didn't have much luck getting <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp">exitwp</a>, which is a wordpress xml to jekyll importer, to gracefully parse my many custom posting tags. I also gave <a href="http://www.ruhoh.com">Ruhoh</a> a quick trial, but it also relies on exitwp to import wordpress posts.</p>
<p>Then I found that <a href="http://doc.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> had its own importer tool using <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">pandoc</a>, which I tested works much better for the non-standard tags in my posts.</p>
<p>In any case, here are the steps I took to migrate to Pelican.</p>
<ol>
<li>Export Wordpress into a XML file</li>
<li>transfer comments to Disqus</li>
<li>install Pelican 3.0.0 dev build</li>
<li>use pelican-import to convert the XML file into markdown posts</li>
<li>moved some posts around into its directory/category</li>
<li>use Textmate to do a bunch of batch fixes</li>
<li>configure Pelican and made a Makefile</li>
<li><del>install ghp-import</del> rolled my own gh-pages script into Makefile</li>
<li>customised a <a href="https://github.com/Quantisan/pelican-svbtle">pelican theme</a></li>
<li>setup Github for custom domain</li>
<li>updated DNS</li>
</ol>
<p>After all of that, this site is now <a href="https://github.com/Quantisan/www.quantisan.com">hosted and served on github</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Our data team of 3 is tasked with pushing our business to be more
data-driven. From encouraging management to make strategic decisions
with hard data to building real-time feedback loop within our products
themselves. We have built the infrastructure in place to capture and
analyse streams of high granularity data using open source tools like
Kafka, Hadoop, and Cascalog. Now the hard part is to convince the rest
of the company that counted numbers on an Excel spreadsheet is
insufficient so that they can incorporate these new high-frequency and
high-granularity information in their everyday decision-making process.</p>
<p>This came to light for me when I tried to revamp our Attribution
Modelling, which is a fancy marketing term for how referral is
attributed and doesn't have to do with mathematical modelling at all.
Many companies traditionally use a last-referral-takes-the-cake
approach. Say if a customer comes in via an email referral first, leaves
the site, then comes back in from an Adword to ultimately make a
purchase, the Adword would get attributed for that revenue produced.
This last-referral method is a lazy way of doing things. Lead generating
referrals get no credit and return on investment values are biased
towards closing-stage marketing efforts. Granted, doing anything else
would require a global view of customer journey, which is a non-trivial
matter. </p>
<p>However, that is exactly what we're able to do easily now. So we
took a couple of days to spike out a fair-share attribution model such
that every touch point a customer used get a share of the pie. The
intention is to provide a holistic view of referrers efficacy to feed
into our higher-level models. But seeing that the old system is so
unrealistic, I thought I might as well open it for everyone else.</p>
<p>Opening a can of worms, that was what it felt like. I found that things
like financial reports and people's bonuses are tied to this old
attribution modelling system. Even though it is obvious to everyone that
the old attribution modelling system is unrealistic, changing it would
require changing the work processes of multiple individuals across the
company. You know what they say about people's habits? Habits are hard
to change. </p>
<p>Seeing that this is a fundamental obstacle to our company's
competitiveness, I've taken a break from pushing our data architecture
to build and evangelise internal data products. I've been working
closely individually with our business people to identify ways of using
data, staging data views from Hadoop/Cascalog back into good old MySQL,
and assisting them to generate actionable data with SQL to make their
lives easier. </p>
<p>One of such views borrows a technique from my algorithmic
trading. By applying a breakout strategy (which I wrote entirely in SQL,
good fun) on the revenue and cost time-series data of our PPC and SEO
campaigns, our PPC/SEO manager now have available a customisable
screener for abnormality with any of our thousands of continuous
marketing campaigns. Very much like a stock screener for breakouts. This
used to be a subjective process based on a spreadsheet of numbers and
expert opinions. Now it's data-driven. </p>
<p>There's a saying that a business
is its people. To become a data-driven organisation, you need
data-driven people. I never realised the significance of this until now.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The other day our marketing guy dropped a laundry list of reports that
he wanted me to produce. I work with him sometimes so I don't mind
putting on a business intelligence hat occasionally to help him out. But
I mustn't forget that driving long-term values to the business is what I
am good at, so I had to say no to him. What's supposed to be a quick
chat with him ended up in a hour long discussion to show case what I'm
working on and demonstrating that I can do so much more than count
things for him. In short, if you want data, ask the business analyst; if
you want to solve problems, let's talk.</p>
<p>It's been said that <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2012/04/04/big-data-reference-model">Big Data
analysis is a feedback loop</a>. However, I don't think having the data science team toil away at data is the message. Who's to say that analytical steps in a big data reference model can't involve feedback
from people in addition to models? For the past week, I've been
showcasing a new internal data product to various stakeholders in our
business. This one data product is now leading to a new process for our
accountant, a product for our online marketing manager, and an
innovative company-wide metric. All of this happened because we
collaborated rather than delegated tasks. Analysing data is not a
one-way process. <a href="http://s.hbr.org/IIVNL0">Make it a feedback loop of math and people</a>.</p> </div>
