            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My cheapskate EC2 experiment has been running well for two days. The
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">t1.micro EC2 cloud server instance ran smoothly</a> for over 48 hours
continuously. I was starting to believe that it's possible to run a
desktop trading system on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/rev-your-trading-system-on-the-cloud-with-a-free-amazon-cloud-server/">Amazon's free offer</a>. Then this happened
this morning on the third day of the experiment. </p>
<p><img alt="EC2 t1.micro" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-11-10_ec2desktop.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Micro instance cloud
server experienced a processing hiccup and was never able to recover.
This is it for running a desktop trading system on a t1.micro. The
cheapest instance of Amazon EC2 is not enough to handle the load. The
only way to get this working is to run in a command-line only mode by
using the JForex API without the client platform or desktop. All that
eye-candy isn't useful anyway on a remote server. Update: I'm wondering
if it's the screensaver that caused the problem. I am now turning the
screensaver off and trying this again. Update 2: No, it looks like it
really is JForex overloading the system.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market took a big bite out of me this week just as when I am not
giving it its fullest attention. I took a short-side trade in Manulife
Financial (MFC.TO) last Thursday simply <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-11jan-put-14-00-0-93-mark-13-97/">because of a price pattern</a>.
I did not seek to confirm my hypothesis with short-term price action and
intermarket analysis like I usually would because I've been so consumed
with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">setting up my trading system on the cloud</a>. I became careless
because of my recent win streak and my involvement in so many matters. I
lost my focus. My short in Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) is deep in red as
of this writing. The market gapped above my stop loss price over the
weekend and never eased back for me to exit at my stop as planned. I've
placed in a limit order to target a retracement to \$14.50 because
there's not much left to recuperate if I dump my position now. MFC.TO is
well above \$15, so I am prepared for the worst. Judging by the volume,
this looks like a valid breakout too. At least my put options don't
expire until January. If my puts expire, this will be a loss of \$372 +
\$9.90 commission = \$381.90 = 3.9% of my RRSP account. To put this into
perspective, according to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>, this may become my biggest
single loss in a trade in this account. Three folds greater than my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/boughtsold-250-tck-b-to-34-1033-68-loss-1-2/">previous biggest loser at 1.23%</a>. Ouch!</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Manulife
Financial (MFC.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-11-08-MFC.TO.png" />][][/caption] Manulife is only half of my
blunder this week. The real killer is in Ventana Gold (VEN.TO). As you
may recall, I have been very bullish on VEN.TO. In fact, I've been
stalking this gem for months by <a href="../tag/ven.to/">nibbling on small bullish positions</a>
to test the water now and then. Just as when I dug myself into a hole
because of this extended loss, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-didnt-miss-a-boat-i-missed-a-freakin-rocket/">VEN.TO launched off on a rocket</a> (Fig.
2). I am just staring at its takeoff outside the fence without the
ability to take a position because of my self-regulated risk exposure
limit. There goes a few weeks of research and analysis out the window.
Double ouch! [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

trading can be, at least I am adament with my risk management and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-reasons-why-i-even-bother-trading-a-small-account/">traded within my limits</a>. A 3.9% loss in a trade is horrible, but
it's not catastrophic. I will survive this one, redo my research, regain
my focus, and be able to fight on another day. This is what trading is
about.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p><span>I bumped into a myriads of obstacles setting up the
<span>JForex</span> trading platform on an </span><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/rev-your-trading-system-on-the-cloud-with-a-free-amazon-cloud-server/">Amazon AWS's free
t1.micro<span> <span>intance</span></span></a>. I will go through the
steps I went through to setup a cloud server for JForex in this post. In
the end, I find out that the t1.micro instance chokes up from running
the GNOME desktop environment on Ubuntu Maverick. I enabled Amazon's
CloudMonitor utility and the CPU measurement is locked at 100% from
running the JForex platform and the desktop. This is expected as I
suspected that the t1.micro wouldn't be able to handle all that graphics
display. I chose to run Ubuntu on EC2 because that's what I'm familiar
with at home. I also considered running CentOS because it is legendary
as an enterprise server. Yet I read reviews from individuals running
their own private VPS saying that <a href="http://knol.google.com/k/tom-harrison/centos-vs-ubuntu/24f5zicu9nl0z/1">CentOS is very secure but it is too
"tight-assed"</a>. As JForex needs a relatively recent commercial Sun
Java version to run, I chose a easier Linux distro for my EC2 instance.
A minor gripe I have with Ubuntu is that their EBS Amazon Machine Image
(AMI) comes in 15 GB. Whereas the free offer from Amazon only provides
10 GB of free EBS use. So there's a 5 GB extra that will be charged on a
monthly basis. This has been discussed on the developer forum and it
looks as though <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-on-ec2/+bug/670161">subsequent versions of Ubuntu release AMI will be in
10GB</a>. However, this 5 GB amounts to only \$0.55 a month. Still, I
want free! I started out my trial on EC2 using the server variant of
Ubuntu. It has less clutter and potentially more secure than the regular
desktop variant. However, getting remote desktop running on the server
took me two evenings to figure out! My problem is in getting a NX server
to work. I tried the commercial, but free, <a href="http://www.nomachine.com/">nxserver from NoMachine</a>.
I tried the GPL implementation, <a href="http://freenx.berlios.de/">FreeNX</a>. And I tried Google's open
source adaptation, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/neatx/">Neatx</a>. It just wouldn't work! As soon as I solved
one problem something else breaks. At first it was an <a href="http://www.jsiegel.com/2008/06/installing-nx-on-amazons-ec2-centos.html">authentication
problem</a> because the SSH keys were mixed between the NX server and SSH
server. Then once that's resolved, the desktop just wouldn't start and
without any error message to tell me what's wrong. That's when I gave up
on NX and switched to using <a href="http://www.x2go.org">X2go</a>. It only took me a few minutes to
install X2go. It ran fine fresh from installation. So many hours wasted
on NX. Once I had my remote desktop running, I tried to install Sun Java
for JForex. After a few failed attempts, I found out about <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/+bug/634487">this
problem</a>. Apparently there's a kernel bug on Ubuntu in which
installing Sun Java on a t1.micro would crash the installer. Just my
luck. By then my curiosity waned and it's just a matter of getting the
job done. So I restarted the whole setup process yet another time with a
Ubuntu 10.10 desktop edition (has been using server edition) 64-bit (to
circumvent the Sun Java installation bug), installed Sun Java, Google
Chrome, and X2go. Logged in to the remote desktop through X2go. Launched
Chrome to access the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy website</a>. Started JForex. It takes
only a few minutes once I know what I'm doing. Then I watched the
t1.micro instance come to a crawl. There's my first attempt at running
JForex on a free t1.micro. My recommendation? <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">Don't do it</a>.</p> </div>
