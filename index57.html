            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just sent in my paper work to <a href="http://fxtrade.oanda.com/">Oanda</a> to open a live forex account
with them last week. Then I heard from @InEgoVeritas the news about
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143">Dukascopy</a> (get 35% discount on commission with that link) reducing
their minimum lot size to micro-lots. After doing more research
comparing Oanda and Dukascopy in the last 24 hours, I think I will go
with Dukascopy in the long term. But I won't make the switch just yet.
Here are my reasons why. Before getting to that, I need to describe my
situation. Choosing a forex broker is like buying a car, we are all
unique and what fits me might not be right for you. Long story short
though. My goal all along is to split my funds 50/50 between interactive
trading and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading</a>. Since Oanda's API access cost \$600
per month, I was to open an additional account with <a href="http://www.mbtrading.com/">MB Trading</a> for
automated trading once I have developed something consistent. In
addition to this latest news from Dukascopy, they also lowered their
minimal opening balance down to \$5,000, and began beta testing for
Metatrader 4 recently (Update: Dukascopy abandoned MT4)! Both Oanda and
Dukascopy are very reputable forex brokers. But Dukascopy has the huge
advantage of providing a free API access. That is one big motivation for
me to go trade with them. Then I can just do everything in one account!
But as I said, I will proceed with live trading with Oanda as planned
soon (once I am out of this drawdown from being <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/early-bird-does-not-get-the-worm-in-forex-trading/">too early in shorting
Aussie</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">other pairs</a>). The reason is that Dukascopy has always
been catered towards institutional or big pocket forex traders. This
aggressive move to welcome retail traders and small timers could be good
and bad. The good part is more business and more buzz for their service,
obviously. The bad part though, is that widening the door to a new
market can turn out stinking the entire operation. It would be analogous
to Mercedes suddenly decided to compete in the budget cars market... oh
wait, they did that! (Mercedes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_B-Class">B-class</a>, enough said) More
specifically regarding Dukascopy, I am most concerned of the impact on
the quality and speed of their trading service. As well as their
customer service. Let's face it, we know that new forex traders (such as
myself) whine a lot and expect a lot for little to nothing. Since I have
my paper work done with Oanda already, it can't hurt to just wait a few
more months to see how the changes go. Nevertheless, I am thrilled of
the new changes with Dukascopy! In the mean time, I will continue to
work on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-psychology/">trading psychology</a>, and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading
strategy</a> (great plug, isn't it?). Update December 2010: I moved my
account over to Dukascopy and have been with them for a few months. So
far so good. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/jforex/">automated trading development with JForex</a> has been
going well too.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[This post was updated on January 13, see addendum below.] I have
discussed my enthusiasm in shorting the Aussie a few times this week.
First trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">shorting AUD/JPY at 84.53</a>. After that got stopped
out, I re-tried at the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-retrying-audjpy-short-84-52-stop-85/">same level the next day</a>. My trade history in
this currency pair is shown in Figure 1 below. Evidently, I am early in
my trades as the recent upward momentum is still going. But that's just
speaking from hindsight advantage. What is actually wrong with this play
is that I was too eager at the first entry when the price was just at a
minor resistance (short-term trendline of Fig 1). In turn, that caused
me to lose my confidence and not be as aggressive as I should be when
the price reached a major resistance at 85.50. Referring to Fig. 1, I
made 5 attempts on the minor resistance below 84.60 in the first round.
What's worse is that I didn't have enough patience to wait after these
shorts failed and I tried again at 84.52. Even though that resistance
level is voided already. But here comes the kicker. I actually <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">noted
the important 85.50 level before my first attempt</a>. It was clearly on the chart and I even mentioned about its
significance. I just figured that it wouldn't be touched. How wrong I
was. As I said, another problem with being early in a trade is that it
stripe you of your confidence prematurely in a good setup. My setup to
short AUD/JPY is as good as ever now. I am drooling over that negative
RSI divergence shown in Fig. 1... But since I've already taken a beating
in this pair this week, my account drawdown dictates that I limit my
risk. As such, I can't back up the truck to pile in on this trade at
this point. But why not? I won't break one rule to compensate for
another. Although I am light in this trade now, I will not compromise my
risk management rules to compensate for my own mistakes. That would just
open a whole new can of worm. Besides, I can't say this often enough --
risk management is always the top priority in trading. In any case,
there will always be other opportunities. The moral of the story is
this. Do not be too eager to get into a trade. Secondly, adjust your
position size accordingly to the significance of the setup in play.</p>

an updated view of AUD/JPY a week later. The red dot on the 9th was my
last stopped out entry. As you can see, I missed the smooth 200 pips
ride down. This experience is proving to be better than I expected to
illustrate how being early in a trade can really hurt your account.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>In the unfortunate case that you are holding a massive losing position
in your portfolio and don't know what to do, the first step to fight
back is to reassess the situation with a rational, unbiased mind. Easier
said than done. But that is what I learned the hard way a few years back
when I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/emfp-the-trade-that-broke-me/">bankrupted my trading account in a single stock</a>. I waited for
weeks and then months. While checking online forums for discussions on
the stock, eager for others to fuel my hope. Hopes for the stock to come
back to some better price so that I can unload. 3 years later, the
company's stock price is still screeching along the zero mark. While I'd
like to think that I have come a long way since then, there is no
guarantee that I won't find myself in that situation again. As such, I
developed a self-assessment questionnaire with questions that needed to
be asked in a crisis. But often not because people are always too
emotionally caught up. It is like an emergency checklist for the
emergency. Here are my 10 questions to ask yourself when nothing is left
but false hope in a dire trading position:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is your current account drawdown compared to your previous
    performance?</li>
<li>How proven is your trading system?</li>
<li>Are your reasons for entering this position still valid?</li>
<li>Is the reason for letting the trade breakaway from you within your
    trading strategy?</li>
<li>What are the emotional reasons to hold this trade?</li>
<li>What are the logical reasons to hold this trade?</li>
<li>What are the emotional reasons to exit this trade?</li>
<li>What are the logical reasons to exit this trade?</li>
<li>What can you do to reduce your overall risk?</li>
<li>And last but not least, WHAT IF the price breaks against your trade
    even further?</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, once the crisis is over, it is time to reflect and review
what went wrong to prevent this from happening again. After all, at
least make something out of this by learning and improving. And if you
can, please share with us your learning experience in the comments below

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been stopped out of all my Aussie shorts on the breakout today. But
my setups for AUDUSD and AUDJPY are still intact as the resistances are
still safe. Having failed so many times in shorting AUDJPY (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">first
try</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-retrying-audjpy-short-84-52-stop-85/">second try</a>), I am taking a conservative approach on that
particular play. Although those setups are ripe for entries, I'll wait
til the test of resistances hold first before entering short again in
AUDJPY and AUDUSD. Which begs the question of, why AUDCAD, and why now?
First of all, I still have conviction about my Aussie short because of
the setups as <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">discussed previously</a> and the fact that gold
price is holding the 40 day ema at 1135 at the moment. That 40 day ema
has worked well on the uptrend in the past few months. So it should be
respected if gold is indeed in a downtrend now as I surmise. So why
short AUDCAD instead of the popular AUDUSD? Simply because AUDUSD broke
out of a short term range whereas AUDCAD is still holding as seen in the
AUDCAD 3-hour chart of Figure 1. This shows AUDCAD is weaker even when
gold is making new short term high.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUD/CAD,
3-hour"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_3h.PNG" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>For the big picture, see Figure 2 for the weekly chart of AUD/CAD. We
see that 0.98-0.99 has always been the turning point for a massive 1000+
pips selloff. We've hit 0.99 back in November and the slide is already
in progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see from Figure 2 that AUDCAD bounced off the 40 week ema
in late December and ran up to 0.95 from 0.92. 0.95 is a decidedly
important round number resistance as it was also a peak in April of
2007. You know, the time before the economy started to crack as shown
with the topping in the markets.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUDCAD,
weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD.png">1</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Now that I've established that the trend is pointing down. I still need
to time my short entry.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the daily chart of AUDCAD. In view of the above
discussion, we have a good chunk of resistance above 9550 as marked by
the purple box in Figure 3. This is the all important safety net for
this short entry. As long as AUDCAD stays below 9600, this long term
setup remains intact. And don't forget the broken uptrend line.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUDCAD,
daily"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_day.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_day.png">2</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Lastly, notice the RSI trends in both the 3-hour (Fig. 1) and daily
charts (Fig 3.), they are both showing negative divergences. Figure 1 is
my timing for this entry, see the current negative RSI divergence marked
by the downward trend in RSI versus the toppy price.</p>
<p>In summary, here are my signals for this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC setup</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Weekly chart shows downward trend.</li>
<li>Big resistance above current price on daily.</li>
<li>Broken uptrend line on daily on retracement from weekly chart.</li>
<li>Intermarket relation with gold testing 40 day ema at 1135.</li>
<li>Negative RSI divergence on 3-hour chart.</li>
