<p><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-down-of-this-weeks-trading-range/">Like the market</a>, my holdings are going sideway this week near their
lows. Based on the price/volume observation this week, here's my
short-term ranking from strong to weak.</p>
<ol>
<li>ESLR</li>
<li>DELL</li>
<li>CAF</li>
<li>SLW</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel ESLR is strongest because of the last hour spike last Friday on 1
million+ volume. They are now sueing Barclays and Lehman to return their
30.9 million loaned shares.</p>
<p></p>
DELL is showing some resilience despite negative news on Yahoo today. It
is testing its low the 2nd time at end-of-day today on a regular
late-day volume. The next day or two will be important times for DELL in
the short term.</p>
<p>CAF is just drifting sideway for now on low volume.</p>
<p>SLW is now under pressure because of weakness in precious metals and the
Euro.</p>

<p>After a couple of weeks of wild ups and downs, we've been stuck in a
trading range this week on low volume (relatively low based on recent
weeks, but about average on regular terms). But seeing today's
end-of-day weakness (testing low on huge volume), I expect the market to
break down tomorrow morning. However, what's more important is where the
bulk of the price will go, so watch the volume tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is like the calm before, yet another, storm. Not really much for me
to do now but just wait and see. If we can hold the 940 support level
(high of 10/10) on the S&amp;P this week, or scrape it on low volume, then
that would be a very good sign.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am going to stick my neck out and say we are bottoming these days.
Why? Here goes.</p>
<p>
In Bill Cara's commentary today, he opines about the [rationale for the
current market crash][] (not the one last week, but this week).

> Why the panic bail-outs? The answer lies in the \$55 trillion dollar
> Credit Default Swap market that is unraveling day to day. Banks and
> central banks are totally focused on the breaks to the credit ring
> when up to \$400 billion of Lehman Brothers CDS obligations come due
> in the next week, with nobody at the teller window to pay up. Lehman
> Brothers is, as you know, bankrupt.
> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><p>
What this means is that unspecified banks holding the Lehman CDS
derivatives will get nothing, and then they will be unable to meet
their obligations to other banks. At stake are the Money Market Funds
on deposit in these banks. The entire system could collapse, so banks
do not want to be in the position of lending to one another. The
credit market has failed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bill suggests that we look at the 3 biggest banks in the world (total
over 90% of CDS market) for the first signs of when the market will tank
further. Because, well... if they can't pull through this mess, we are
really doomed.</p>
<p></p>
So here's where my own analysis comes in. Besides Bill's rationale, we
know the current crisis is caused by the collapse of the financial
market. So I've been looking at the financial heavyweights in any case.</p>
<p>Enough talk, let's look at the market today. After the failed attempt of
a rally earlier this week, the market is widely expected to continue
spiral down. It has. And the media is certainly not short of fueling the
panic. See: Worries over economy spread; global markets sink and
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122411376471138395.html?mod=todays_us_nonsub_page_one">Economic Fears Reignite Market Slump</a>. However, <em>what everyone knows
isn't worth knowing</em>.</p>
<p>The only information traders should listen to though, is the price data.</p>

<p>As I was saying, based on yesterday's end-of-day move, the market is
expected to tank today, at least this morning. If we focus on the 3
banks, we can see they have broken yesterday's end-of-day low and are
testing the Monday lows. However, this is the key, their 15 min volume
on today's low is below yesterday's last 15 min when the prices dived.
All of their prices are testing their lows on lower volumes!</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>I believe the selling is drying up</strong>.</p>
<p>Does this mean we'll be shooting up from here? Perhaps. But this is a
very good sign. I would wait until the next significant daily move
(either up or down) and watch the quality of the action before making
any monetary committment in this crazy market.</p>

estimation based on option prices" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/option_est1.jpg?w=500" title="option_est1" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>I'd like to document a useful technique I picked up today from Tom
Sosnoff on <a href="http://shadowtrader.net/">ShadowTrader</a>. It's based on the idea that option pricing
has become so efficient that it can be used to predict actual stock
move.</p>
<p>Since it is expiration Friday this week, the Oct 08 index option are
expiring in two days. So for something like, SPX, the Oct 08 call/put
has only two days left. Thus, there's little time decay factored in the
price for these options with respect to the actual price. In other
words, SPX and SPX options prices are converging.</p>
<p>So if we take the price of the straddle and strangle strike on the
money, it should be the expected move for SPX for this Friday. For
example, SPX closed at 907.84 today. The price for a straddle at 905
strike is \$48.65. The price for a strangle at 900/910 strikes is
\$45.30. We'll average the two numbers (\$48.65 + \$45.30) / 2 = \$47.0.</p>
<p>So the SPX is expected to move about 50 points this Friday either up or
down.</p>
