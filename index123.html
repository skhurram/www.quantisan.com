            <div class="article-content"> <p>Came across this gem accidentally today. Here are the [complete 20
lectures for CS 229 Machine Learning from Stanford University][] for my
own record. I have learned most of the material before, but have
forgotten most of it already. In particular, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCqPMD6coO8">last lecture</a> talks
about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POMDP">POMDP</a>. I have always thought it would be a great tool to be
applied on a financial trading system. Long story short, POMDP is a
distinctive machine learning algorithm because it inherently assumes the
'world' is partially-observable (MDP on its own takes care of the
uncertainty part). A drawback with using artificial intelligence in
trading is that A.I. are good for closed ended system but bad for open
ended ones (i.e. trading). I believe POMDP can be worked on to become a
valuable trading system. I haven't tried implementing it myself yet
because of lack of a good platform and data. But since POMDP has been
around for years now, I would assume somebody somewhere has tried this
already. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any information on
this problem. In any case, this post is merely a reminder for myself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-down-of-this-weeks-trading-range/">Like the market</a>, my holdings are going sideway this week near their
lows. Based on the price/volume observation this week, here's my
short-term ranking from strong to weak.</p>
<ol>
<li>ESLR</li>
<li>DELL</li>
<li>CAF</li>
<li>SLW</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel ESLR is strongest because of the last hour spike last Friday on 1
million+ volume. They are now sueing Barclays and Lehman to return their
30.9 million loaned shares.</p>
<p></p>
DELL is showing some resilience despite negative news on Yahoo today. It
is testing its low the 2nd time at end-of-day today on a regular
late-day volume. The next day or two will be important times for DELL in
the short term.</p>
<p>CAF is just drifting sideway for now on low volume.</p>
<p>SLW is now under pressure because of weakness in precious metals and the
Euro.</p>

<p>After a couple of weeks of wild ups and downs, we've been stuck in a
trading range this week on low volume (relatively low based on recent
weeks, but about average on regular terms). But seeing today's
end-of-day weakness (testing low on huge volume), I expect the market to
break down tomorrow morning. However, what's more important is where the
bulk of the price will go, so watch the volume tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is like the calm before, yet another, storm. Not really much for me
to do now but just wait and see. If we can hold the 940 support level
(high of 10/10) on the S&amp;P this week, or scrape it on low volume, then
that would be a very good sign.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am going to stick my neck out and say we are bottoming these days.
Why? Here goes.</p>
<p>
In Bill Cara's commentary today, he opines about the [rationale for the
current market crash][] (not the one last week, but this week).

> Why the panic bail-outs? The answer lies in the \$55 trillion dollar
> Credit Default Swap market that is unraveling day to day. Banks and
> central banks are totally focused on the breaks to the credit ring
> when up to \$400 billion of Lehman Brothers CDS obligations come due
> in the next week, with nobody at the teller window to pay up. Lehman
> Brothers is, as you know, bankrupt.
> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><p>
What this means is that unspecified banks holding the Lehman CDS
derivatives will get nothing, and then they will be unable to meet
their obligations to other banks. At stake are the Money Market Funds
on deposit in these banks. The entire system could collapse, so banks
do not want to be in the position of lending to one another. The
credit market has failed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bill suggests that we look at the 3 biggest banks in the world (total
over 90% of CDS market) for the first signs of when the market will tank
further. Because, well... if they can't pull through this mess, we are
really doomed.</p>
<p></p>
So here's where my own analysis comes in. Besides Bill's rationale, we
know the current crisis is caused by the collapse of the financial
market. So I've been looking at the financial heavyweights in any case.</p>
<p>Enough talk, let's look at the market today. After the failed attempt of
a rally earlier this week, the market is widely expected to continue
spiral down. It has. And the media is certainly not short of fueling the
panic. See: Worries over economy spread; global markets sink and
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122411376471138395.html?mod=todays_us_nonsub_page_one">Economic Fears Reignite Market Slump</a>. However, <em>what everyone knows
isn't worth knowing</em>.</p>
<p>The only information traders should listen to though, is the price data.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_394" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>As I was saying, based on yesterday's end-of-day move, the market is
expected to tank today, at least this morning. If we focus on the 3
banks, we can see they have broken yesterday's end-of-day low and are
testing the Monday lows. However, this is the key, their 15 min volume
on today's low is below yesterday's last 15 min when the prices dived.
All of their prices are testing their lows on lower volumes!</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>I believe the selling is drying up</strong>.</p>
<p>Does this mean we'll be shooting up from here? Perhaps. But this is a
very good sign. I would wait until the next significant daily move
(either up or down) and watch the quality of the action before making
any monetary committment in this crazy market.</p>
