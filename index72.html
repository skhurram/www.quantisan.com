            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>USD/CAD made a quick run to 1.10 and retraced back down to 1.08. Since
my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-usdcad-1-06754/">entry at 1.06754 almost two weeks ago</a>, there's been both
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-failing-to-break-above-a-short-term-downtrend/">run-down</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/us-dollar-vs-canadian-broke-above-resistance-after-fomc-and-before-g20/">run-up</a> as I have noted. Although this trade turned
out well with an average paper gain of 171.1 pips (see stats below), one
thing that I'd definitely need to work on is not giving back the profit.
For the first half of my position, USD/CAD topped at 1.0948 and I
existed at 1.0872, which is 0.71% of unrealized profit left on the
table. For the second half, USD/CAD topped at 1.0992 and I exited at
1.0821, which is a dismal 1.6% left on the table. I could have doubled
my gain if I can take my chips off the table at a better time.
Obviously, I still need a lot of work to do in sharpening my stops. For
that, I started to keep track of my trades using a detailed spreadsheet
that have custom macros to calculate my performance statistics. Some of
these numbers are displayed below. I will now focus on the <em>quality</em> of
a trade rather than just on the net outcome of a trade while I'm working
on improving my trading. I'll cover this topic another time once the
spreadsheet is done. I am still tweaking the formulas and format as I
record more trades in it. Entry: 1.06754, 5000 units Exit 1: 1.0872,
2500 units Exit 2: 1.0821, 2500 units Net: +196.6 pips and +145.6 pips
Time held: 159:27:00 and 256:14:00 Max. Drawdown %: <strong>0.12%</strong> (a very
good number) % from Max. Gain: <strong>0.71%</strong> and <strong>1.60%</strong> (not so good
numbers)</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Brunswick Corp. (BC) stayed above \$11.00 as we began the week. I placed
a stop at Friday's high before the open today to be executed at 10:30am.
When I got back at lunch, I found that my stop was triggered as soon as
it was sent. Luckily, it was also at the time when BC retraced the
open's gain slightly. So it was a good price to be out since BC has
closed above \$12 today (Figure 1). This trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-bc-100-oct-09-12-5-put-1-95-mark-10-81/">entered last Friday
before noon at 1.95</a>, when BC was trading at 10.81. This represents a
loss of \$65. For this particular trade, I adhered to my exit strategy
(even though it was a loss), so that's good. For the entry, I could have
waited later on in the day on Friday to see how the market performs as
we approached the end of the week. If I had done that, the reward/risk
would have been better. But I think I would have entered short anyway
since the sign were pointing downward when BC hung back to around \$11
at the close after breaking above \$11.20 intraday on good volume. And
the fact hat the market was consolidating too. Looking at the long term,
BC has retraced all its loss since the dive last year. For the market,
S&amp;P500 has etched higher today too but is still about 10 points below
last week's all-year high. The volume for the overall market is
noticeably lighter too. So this uptrend can possibly continue up as not
many is riding this move. We shall see how this goes. As can be seen
from Figure 2, BC at \$12 has some resistance above to \$13. For the
lower end of the range, we have \$9.60. A break below \$9.60 would
signal a stop of this recent bull train's momentum.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
I started watching this video (attached below) merely out of curiosity.
Just to see what test in Japan is harder than becoming a lawyer or a
surgeon. But as I was watching it, the parallel of their recurring theme
on the goal of [Kendo][], which is to defeat yourself, rather than your
opponent, is strikingly similar to what I've been trying to accomplish
in trading. The video follows two 8th dan Kendo test candidates, Ishida
Kenichi, a National Kendo Champion 15 years ago (whom have failed this
test 4 times since), and Kai Miyamoto, a 78-year-old that has tried this
test for 24 times in 24 consecutive years and failing every time. Watch
the hour long video and take from it what you can yourself. Here are a
couple of quotes as teasers.

> "Mr. Ishida trains to teach his body not accidental swings, but only
> perfectly calculated and timed movements." (flip through any trading
> psychology book and I'm sure you'll find similar words)

Toward the end of the video, Ishida had to write an essay on the topic
of "The Sword is Soul". The translator summarized Ishida's essay as
follows.

> "The most important aspect of Kendo is to have a humble enough mind to
> admit that you are weak and train to improve yourself."

Replace the word "Kendo" with "trading" and there you have it. A
seemingly trite statement, but only when you are able to appreciate the
simplicity and truth of such words by a former Japanese National Kendo
Champion can you begin to truly learn, rather be it Kendo or trading.

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Here's one last try in shorting Brunswick Corp. <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Brunswick_(BC)">BC</a> gapped open about
50 cents this morning on an analyst upgrade. It subsequently tested
\$11.00 with about 5 times first 30-minute volume. It has since been in
a trading range. Why is this significant? Observing Figure 1, we can see
that \$10.85 is the 62% Fibonacci level of the entire drop from Sept 19,
2008. Practically exactly a year ago. Secondly, this huge volume at open
is good as it typically signal retail/pubic euphoria. Combining the two,
huge volume retail push + test a long term resistance = shorting
opportunity! In the near term, BC is also testing a resitance as shown
in Figure 2. Finally the stars may be aligned for a short in BC. I have
tried many times and failed miserably in the past several weeks. But
after analysing my trades and re-evaluating my method, this setup offers
a very good chance. So let's see how it goes. Entry: \$10.81 Stop:
\$11.00 by end of next week. Target: \$9.00, the next Fibonacci level.
Reward / Risk = \$155 / \$45 = 3.4. (These values are obtained by
estimating the premium of this option at expiry using the
Bjerksund-Stensland approximation.)</p>
