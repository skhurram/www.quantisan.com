            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5au3BzQQNI/AAAAAAAAAIU/S2TdOP-MEn4/s400/rpt.jpg" />][] The FED came out with an emergency rate cut of 3/4 pt today.
The market was bound for a small rally. So the Dow moved from a negative
400 something point to almost breakeven and then closed down a 100 pts.
There were many wild swings today. Many opportunities for a day trader.</p>
<p>Although I seem to have done well today, I think I could have done a lot
better.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5avoBzQQOI/AAAAAAAAAIc/8w-84LbudSE/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][]Even though I knew the Dow is going to go up at least 200 pts
from open, I only captured about 150 points of it. I was hesitating a
lot after my winnings because I worried about losing my profits like I
did before. I need to be objective in my rationale.</p>
<p>However, the later day action were a lot choppier and the ATR were a lot
higher. Staying on the sideline may be a good decision. For my later
trades in a volatile setting, I may want to increase my stop because I
have missed a few good trades even though I was ultimately right.</p>
<p>On the other hand, my exits were a lot better today. I wasn't bagholding
nor was I ragholding. I got out when I should rather I was winning or
losing. In addition, my tight trailing stop method saved me a few times.
Although it did got me out too early a few times too.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have adopted this new screen which I developed over the
weekend. It's based on the triple screen strategy by Dr. Alexander
Elder. The big window is for my main time frame. Then two more charts
for a 5x higher and another for a 5x shorter time frames. I only enter a
trade when all 3 (at least the lower 2's) are in sync. Then I exit when
either the short or current time period shows weakness.</p>

The break of the MACD and Stochastic didn't produce a strong pullback as
I have hoped. However, one thing for certain is that by the time even I
am sure it's going to fall, it would have been too late.</p>
<p>I almost entered a short position today. But held back because I am
taking enough risk already with the 4 gold contracts. If I'm to cover 2
fewer Gold shorts, then I may enter a Soybean.</p>
<p>Looking at the past year of history, it seems that Soybean corrections
precede Gold corrections. Coincidence? They seem to be controlled as a
hedge by HB&amp;B. A big drop in prices should come when these people unload
their holdings back into the equities. i.e. near the bottom of this bear
market.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5EWDvY4uyI/AAAAAAAAAIE/xYQcA2QZuo8/s400/gold.jpg" />][] Gold doesn't seem to be falling much like a correction would.
The current price is inching lower instead of falling as it should based
on the MACD and Stochastic bearish signals are disappointing. It's just
going sideways. So I'm wondering would this be just a brief
consolidation before it rises to new highs again? This uncertainty is
definitely why the price is going sideways at the moment.</p>
<p>Price is about \$885 at the moment. It would have been better if I only
had my 2 positions from above \$886. But I entered 2 more shorts at
\$880.10 in fear of missing the train. That was definitely a mistake
because it hugely increased my risk. I pretty much got in at the bottom
of the current trading range. I could have entered easily at \$886 from
the bounce when the indicators were right.</p>
<p>Last night, price of gold dropped to \$870.80 and I had over \$1000 of
paper profit. But it was short lived.</p>
<p>I won't cover on panic at the moment. I might cover the 2 extra shorts
on the next bump. Just so I can makeup for my greedy mistake and lower
my risk exposure in this uncertain situation.</p>
<p>However, after dropping for 3 days in a row, today's higher close is
expected. Next week should be more telling.</p>

expecting that Bush's speech on a stimulus package would cause a mini
rally to squeeze the shorts. So I kept entering trades on the Buy
signals. As you can see from the graph, it didn't happen. Stupid me. The
parameter is definitely too loose at the moment on the Buy signal. I
have adjusted it now and it seems to be a bit better (fewer false
positives).</p>
<p>I also shouldn't read too much into comments from Bill Cara's blog. Both
times I went against my own judgement because of reading too much of
other people's comments led to big losses. Lesson is to
<span style="font-weight:bold;">never have any expectation of the
market</span>. See what the price is doing and interpret it based on
that, and that alone. End of story.</p>
<p>In total, I think I'm down about a \$500 from my YM day trading for the
past couple of weeks. If there's any consolation, I think my system is
improving from these failures.</p>
