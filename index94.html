            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4aPYPY4ueI/AAAAAAAAAFk/6nT6t04d9jw/s400/ym_daytrade_perfstat.jpg" />][] I somehow just jumped into my first day of mini Dow day
trading today. It started pretty bad as my emotion and lack of a
definitive strategy resulted in a couple of big losses and excessive
trading early in the day (see chart below). One thing I've done well
that saved me from a probably whipout was cutting my losses short. I was
on the wrong side a couple of times before the spikes, but I was able to
hit the "close all" button despite seeing some big paper losses already.
Those decisions turned out well as I would have been down even more if I
wasn't decisive.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4aPevY4ufI/AAAAAAAAAFs/am0y9aCWTXI/s400/ym_daytrade_perf.jpg" />][]</p>

became more and more successful. I nearly brokeeven but a few
"out-of-strategy" trade (bad!) put me back deep into the red again. A
few key concepts that I need to remind myself again and again are as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>PATIENCE!</li>
<li>Wait for the right signals for HIGH probability trades. It's ok to
    miss some moves!</li>
<li>Cut losses short and take profit SLOWLY. Stick with strategy on both
    entries and exits.</li>
<li>Don't over-trade!</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's the final screen I used for day trading today. I went through a
few versions as the day went by already. This particular screen and
strategy seems to perform well.</p>
<p></p>
[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4aLH_Y4ucI/AAAAAAAAAFU/PULeXcMHETw/s400/ym_daytrade.jpg" />][] On a positive note, the strategy I developed from today's
experience using trial and error is invaluable. I think this can be
programmed into a mechanical system. More on this later after I've done
my trade analysis.</p>
<p>For now, I need some rest!</p>

is current trading at a 34-year high. How long can this continue? Both
gold and grains seem to be making record highs. Is this a shorting
opportunity? I'll watch the 3 markets closely.</p>
<p>On another note, many famous traders seem to have made their first pot
of gold on soybean futures.</p>

<p>Using multiple <span class="span_HiLite">Keltner</span> Channels of the
same length but with different ATR. The ones with larger ATR's give
wider bands, and the ones with smaller ATR's giver narrower bands.</p>
<p>To go long with the system, you would buy stop when
<span class="span_HiLite">price</span> have risen to cross into the
wider band, and stop is always adjusted to where
<span class="span_HiLite">price</span> would have dropped to cross the
narrower band, thereby giving you a trade that stays long as long as
<span class="span_HiLite">price</span> is outside of the narrower band.
For example, on <strong>May 1st, 2003</strong>, doing so with 2 ATRs for the wider
band and 1 ATR for the narrower band would have given you the trade of
<strong>BRCM</strong> entered at 13:33 at 17.67 and exited at 14:51 at 14:51 at
17.92, for a difference of 25 cents.</p>
<p>It is suggested to use this concept with ADX and Time Series Forecast.</p>

experience while I develop my auto system. The market I've chosen is YM
(mini Dow) for the short term, ZG (CBOT Gold) for the longer term, and
Corn for the long long term.</p>
<p>YM is on CBOT, so I wouldn't have to shell out another \$55 for the
NYMEX data. It's also a more popular/mature market than ER2 so I can
obtain fundamental analysis easier to complement my technical analysis.
The recent price action is also very predictable.</p>
<p>For example, the marked spot on the left graph is a potential strategy.
Notice the breakdown of the TRIX corresponds with an imminent breakdown
of the price. This is just one example. But observing price pattern and
TRIX pattern seems to be useful.</p>
<p>For my other two choices.</p>
<p>Gold is hot at the moment, so there could be huge swings. It's now
around \$890 and I'm expecting a correction based on the fundamentals.
I'll watch the price pattern and indicators to time my entry.</p>
<p>Corn is on a run for the past 3 months. It has low margin requirement
(\~\$1000) and the price are quite consistent. So waiting for
breakout/down can riding the trend could be a long term profitable
trade.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Another day, another strategy. For the past couple of days, I've been
working on the 2MA cross with ADX confirmation strategy for ER2H08 1200
sh/bar. Basically, an HMA(Low, 8) crossing over EMA(Low, 24) as the
trigger. Condition2 is that the current high is highest of past 3 bars.
Condition3 is current ADX is also highest of the past 3 bars. Condition4
is that it is during day time so fewer slippage.</p>
<p>Exit is simply HMA(Low, 23) crossing under EMA(Low, 33) or it is nearing
the close of the day session. Stop is \$350; Floor is \$500 and 63%
retracement.</p>
<p>Upon loose optimization on Oct 1, 2007 to Nov 30, 2007 data, the Long
strategy achieved 3.37 profit factor, 57% profitable, and a steadily
rising performance graph. Very good indeed. I was estatic yesterday.</p>
<p>I continued to work on the strategy for the whole day today and
developed a Short version using the same concept. The result were very
good too (PF > 3, etc).</p>
<p>From the back-testing data, the Long and Short together has PF over 2
and steady rising performance too. From the calculation, I would make
over \$7000 for the 2 months on 1 contract alone.</p>
<p>Feeling pretty confident, I felt the system was somewhat complete, so I
tested it using the lastest 30 days of data. Unfortunately, it failed
miserably. PF was way under 1.0 and the gross profit were a mere couple
of thousand dollars. The net profit were estimated to be just a few
hundred dollars.</p>
<p>So I tested the system on another set of data. August 2007. The result
was even worse!</p>
<p>Long story short, I found out that ADX isn't that reliable to confirm
with major swings.</p> </div>
