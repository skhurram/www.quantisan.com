            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update at Noon: Looks like I am wrong. LLL.TO is testing its recent high
at \$40.50. However, volume is rather low up to now. I'm out my
Lululemon (LLL.TO) position because of market softness. Bonds (TLT) are
holding a support level. EUR/USD is struggling to hold above 1.27. And
the oversea markets (Asia and Europe) are weak overnight. Perhaps the
market is getting ready to catapult up. Perhaps it is not. But I'm not
going to place my bet on anything as I don't have a clue where it's
about to go at the moment. So I am stopping out of this position at
breakeven. Preserving capital. Moreover, recent price move in Lululemon
(LULU on Nasdaq) is disappointing. Despite the market marking new
consecutive highs for the past few days, LLL is stuck in a rut as shown
in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Purchase price of these shares were [\$39.86 from a week ago][].</p>
<p>Exact return is (\$40 - \$39.86) * 140 = \$19.60 - \$9.90 commission =
\$9.70. In any case, I'm all cash in my account now. At least I've free
myself from the market for the next two weeks during my trip to Hong
Kong. Here's an updated view of the daily chart of LLL.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Java is the programming language that I have known and used the longest.
I learned Java as part of the curriculum when I was in my first year of
undergraduate study. Although reluctant at first, I can still recall the
joy I felt switching over from C++. No more garbage collection! That was
ten years ago. I haven't done any real programming in the last few years
as my engineering work has become higher and higher level. Although I
have maintained my hobby in developing automated trading strategies and
quantitative analysis, much of that work are mere child's play compared
to what I have done and much forgotten. Lately, words such as "<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/from-object-oriented-programming-to-object-oriented-design/">code
smell</a>", "design pattern", and the likes are creeping back into my
world as I am <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-to-lose-focus-by-defining-what-i-want-from-trading/">comitting myself</a> to pursuit my esoteric fascination in
financial engineering. The first step, research, was a few months of
testing the possibilities to decide what I should use. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">Different
markets</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">different brokers</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/comparing-trading-api-from-6-online-forex-brokerages/">different platforms</a>, and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">different technology</a>. I decided to study the foreign exchange market
through <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy's JForex platform</a> using Java. Although ideally, I
would be using Oanda and Python... But I'm not prepared to cough out
\$600 per month for Oanda's API. Some of the other tools that I use are
<a href="http://rapid-i.com">RapidMiner</a> and <a href="http://weka.wikispaces.com/">Weka</a>. Both of which offer a Java API. Having
learned JForex and programmed a few strategies already, I have tested
the water enough. For the past few weeks, I have been taking steps to
move to the next level of my development. However, as I play with
programming more and more, I realize that I am fundamentally outdated in
my programming skills. There were no <em>interface</em> when I learned Java.
Neither was there <em>hashset</em> and <em>annotation</em>. As such, before doing
anything else, I am just going to pause for the next two weeks while I
am travelling in Hong Kong and catch up on my Java knowledge (I just
realized that they don't publish those Teach Yourself \&lt;insert topic>
in 24 Hours book anymore. The Head First series seem to be the craze
nowadays). My goal is to devour a Java book in the 15-hour flight. Let's
see if I still got it after ten years.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market may be initiating a bear rally again according to the breath
indicator of Figure 1. We are seeing a positive divergence from the
upticking companies above 50-dma/200-dma ratio (solid line in main
graph) and the lower low on the TSX. Furthermore, TSX index price has
been holding a longer term support at 11000 despite a new recent low on
the number of companies above their respective 200 day moving average
(top indicator) . The CDNV to TSX ratio is also showing a similar
positive divergence.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Toronto
Composite (\$TSX)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-TSX.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Thus, I am taking a bullish step with a cautious long position in
Lululemon (LLL.TO). There's a strong uptrend in this one as shown in
Figure 2. \$37.50 looks like a long term support. However, my stop is
\$38-\$39 zone to be in sync with the market move. Also, the gap to
\$37.50 support has been closed previously already in May, so a second
re-test wouldn't bold well for LLL.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Lululemon
Athletica (LLL.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO.png">1</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>In addition to the chart, LLL currently has an enormous 22.79% short
floats according to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/finviz/">Finviz</a>. It is 70.51% owned by the big money with
a 3.72% increase in holding in the last quarter. Short squeeze, anyone?</p>
<p>I took timed my entry based on intraday chart Figure 3. The top gap
today held for the first hour at least and then there were some
increased volume at the intraday support. I entered then.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="LLL.TO intraday

<p>However, LLL touched \$40 and is now retraced below \$39.50.</p>
<p>My mental stop is \$39.00 and my hard stop is \$38.50.</p>
<p>That is a risk of (\$38.50 - \$39.86) * 140 = \$190.40 + \$9.90
commission = \$200.30 = 2.13%.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Market volatility continues in June. I took a more aggressive approach
this month and executed more trades in my RRSP trading account. The
monthly return is excellent but I noticed a few issues with my trading.
These will be the main topic of this post. Let's go over some
performance data. Seeing that it is the end of the second quarter, I
will do a quarterly statistical report. I couldn't do <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">a monthly review
like I used to</a> because I trade much less frequently now. Note that
the October data is from last year's forex trading. That was the best
month I've had. I am attaching the data here just for comparison.
<strong>Quarterly Metric Q2 October</strong> Sarting Fund \$8,000.00 End of Quarter
Fund \$9,404.87 Total Net Profit \$1,404.87 Gross Profit \$1,800 Gross
Loss -\$395 Profit Factor 4.56 1.75 Net Profit % <strong>17.56%</strong> 4.19% Max.
Drawdown % 3.36% 2.32% Total Commission \$155.1 Commission / Net Return
<strong>11.04%</strong> This highlight the bane of my problem trading my RRSP.
Although <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> offers the best commission in Canada as far as I
know, it is still much higher than those offered by brokers in the
states. However, this is a self-directed RRSP trading account, so it's
not like I can just switch broker. I will just have to stop being so
active in my trading for this particular account. Sterling Ratio 1.44
0.65 Excess Return 17.46% 4.14% SDev Return per Trade 2.21% 0.79%
Kurtosis -0.93 8.53 Skewness 0.72 2.49 These statistics above show my
second problem. Although I am very profitable so far, my return per
trade is not consistent. The distribution is too flat and not skewed
enough to the positive for my liking. A standard deviation less than 1%,
a slightly positive kurtosis, and a skewness above 1.0 would be ideal.
95th Percentile P&amp;L \$421.15 \$70.11 5th Percentile P&amp;L -\$102.13

Largest Winning Trade \$464.05 \$171.79 Largest Losing Trade -\$116.75
-\$44.17 Most of my winning are due to <a href="../sold-12-cve-to-puts-2-90-mark-27-50-10-gain/">this Cenovus short in May</a> and
<a href="../sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">this CIBC short in June</a>. Avg. Time Held 5.17 days 2.18 hours Aside
from trading my RRSP account, I have finally opened a live <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">forex
account at Dukascopy</a>. My time remains split between developing
automated strategies for trading forex and manual equity trading as
usual. My JForex contest strategy in June ends up near the bottom again
as I took the wrong side of the move on USD/CAD. The JForex contest will
start with a new set of rules for July. Namely that strategies need to
be fully automated and winnings from each trade cannot be excessive
(50%) to prevent an all-in approach that's been dominating the contest.
My revised strategy is ready. It is now version 2.14 since the first
release in April.</p>
<h2>Goal for July</h2>
<p>My goal for July is to learn the indicators part of the JForex API and
to program my first custom JForex indicator from my other collection. I
will be away in Hong Kong for two weeks in July for some family matter.
So there's not much time to work.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>What I thought would be an intermediate term hold turns out to have
lasted mere minutes. I bought Teck Cominco (TCK.B.TO) after a small
bounce at \$34 support during lunch today. Figure 1 shows the clear
support level. Also note the fact that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-43-mark-16-27-loss-0-5/">my recent shorts haven't been
working</a>, so I thought I would go with the flow and go long. [caption

immediately after my long entry (something I haven't done in a while).
TCK cracked the \$34 support swiftly to \$33.80, my mental support. My
alert was sounded and I kept an eye on it afterward. But then not long
after \$33.80, my hard stop at \$33.70 was filled and TCK traded down to
\$33.66 or so. It has now stabilized around \$33.80 as of 2pm. Figure 2
shows the intraday chart of TCK.B.TO. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

for this trade is (\$33.68 - \$34.10) * 250 = -\$105 - \$4.95 * 2
commission = -\$114.90 = -1.2% of account. My account is now
experiencing a 3.4% drawdown since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">the high on June 8th</a>. I can't
help but feel that this was a stop hunt. TCK is creeping higher at the
moment. However, as my initial position was stopped out, I am not going
to re-enter this trade just yet. Let's see what it does near the close
today. I am labelling this particular trade as a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">bad trade</a> because
my stop was clearly too tight based on the time frame that I am
observing. I should have reduced my position size and widened my stop to
account for the recent volatility. Update: TCK gapped down 7% the day
after. At least my exit was timely.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Not much is happening in the market as it is trading in a tight range.
This is not good for my options as the time delta will slowly eating
away my premium. So I've decided to unload this position at a small loss
just now as the market is testing support across the board. The U.S.
dollar index is testing \$86 resistance. Oil is testing \$78 support.
S&amp;P500 is testing the 1070 support zone. Purchase price for these puts
were [\$1.48 per contract last Wednesday][]. When Manulife Financial
(MFC.TO) was trading at 16.38. Loss is (\$1.48 - \$1.43) * 100 * 4 =
\$20 - \$13.95 * 2 commission = \$47.90 = 0.5% of account. As you can
see, the commission is horrible on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">RRSP trading account at
Questrade</a>. I will wind down trading options from now on and move back
to trading forex in the summer. My live account at <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> is
ready... Update: The market finally broke support the day after this
exit. This was not a good exit as I lost patience. MFC is testing \$16
support on June 29th opening hour and I don't expect it to hold. This
could turn out to be a winner if I had held.</p>
