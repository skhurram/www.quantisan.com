    </h1>

    <div class='article-content'>
        <p>Much has been written about when to buy stocks, forex, or other
instruments. In fact, it is the topic that is written the most about in
trading. As if there's nothing else to trading than timing your entries.
On the contrary, I have come to realize that timing for entries is
actually the least important aspect of a trade (see a real world prove
below). Nevertheless, it is still a factor for consideration in a
complete trading strategy. As such, this post is about the 4 fundamental
entry signs that I use to enter in any trade. No matter which trading
setup I am using, I only place my order because one or more of these
conditions are met. To make sure that everyone is on the same page. Let
me define what exactly I am talking about here. I define the act of
timing for an entry as the process for deciding <strong>where or when to place
an order</strong> after a signal has been flagged by a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setup</a>. In
particular, it would be step #8 according to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC setup</a>. For
example, if the conditions to buy USDCAD are met on the daily chart,
then I will zoom in on to the 3-hour timeframe to spot a confirmation of
the move. Once that is also satisfied, I zoom in even more to the
30-minute chart to spot when (if market order) or where (if limit order)
to place the order. Figuring out exactly when and where to place your
bet is a topic for much discussion, even when you know that you want to
buy it somewhere around this level. The better the price, the better
your reward/risk will be. Wait too long, and the market could leave you
behind. Long story short, when it comes down to it, there are simply 4
fundamental entry signs for buying in any market that I use. I only buy
at/when the price is:</p>
<ol>
<li>at a support area</li>
<li>at a Fibonacci retracement level</li>
<li>at oversold conditions</li>
<li>showing accumulation by large players</li>
</ol>
<p>(and vice versa for shorting a market) These are necessary, but not
sufficient entry conditions. One or more of these conditions must be met
for all trades. But satisfying these conditions would not guarantee
profitability. I know I've repeated this many times now, but I can't
stress this enough. This is just <strong>one small step</strong> of a thorough
analytical process in deciding your trade. Don't go around buying
everything on support levels or when RSI goes over 80. The reason why I
find it necessary to write about something so trivial now is that I have
just been caught trying to catch a top again. Take a look at the figure
below illustrating my trade orders trying to catch a USD/CAD short-term
top. My trading setup flagged for a short USDCAD trade. So I gave it a
few tries. Eight times. Eight! If only I had remembered my 4 fundamental
entry signs, I wouldn't have tried to short this pair all over the place
and getting stopped out again and again. If I adhered to these 4 signs,
I would have only tried it a couple of times at 1.0480 resistance and
then let it pass once the condition is violated. On the other hand, as I
was saying earlier that the entry is the least important aspect of a
trade. I came out of this mess as illustrated unscathed. I managed to
exit all of my entries at break-even, or at least close to it. So even
failing 8 entries, my account balance barely budged. Recall I said
timing for entries is the least important part of trading? Well, this is
a good example of it. You could mess up your entries, 8 times, and still
come out ok. You probably know this already, but I'll say this for the
sake of thoroughness. By far the most important aspect of a profitable
trading strategy is prudent <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>. That is what saved me
in this embarrassing shorting USD/CAD example.</p>
