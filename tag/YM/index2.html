expecting that Bush's speech on a stimulus package would cause a mini
rally to squeeze the shorts. So I kept entering trades on the Buy
signals. As you can see from the graph, it didn't happen. Stupid me. The
parameter is definitely too loose at the moment on the Buy signal. I
have adjusted it now and it seems to be a bit better (fewer false
positives).</p>
<p>I also shouldn't read too much into comments from Bill Cara's blog. Both
times I went against my own judgement because of reading too much of
other people's comments led to big losses. Lesson is to
<span style="font-weight:bold;">never have any expectation of the
market</span>. See what the price is doing and interpret it based on
that, and that alone. End of story.</p>
<p>In total, I think I'm down about a \$500 from my YM day trading for the
past couple of weeks. If there's any consolation, I think my system is
improving from these failures.</p>

to filter out the noise. It's also because I found that I'm not quick
trigger enough on fast times. I'm using 1200 contracts/bar at the
moment. It seems to be good. I'm also a lot more disciplined today. Not
over trading and sticking to my strategy. At the very least, my recent
loses have given me valuable experiences in day trading. Also, the floor
pivot points have been very reliable so far. The price seems to like to
bounce around these levels or settle in a range near them. Very useful
in identifying breakouts or exhaustions.</p>
<p>Here are some changes I added to my day trading screen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implemented my CCI and Stochastic strategy into a PaintBar with
    alarms</li>
<li>Added Stochastic crossing of oversold or overbought as ShowMe with
    alarms</li>
<li>Increased contracts/bar to 1200 contracts / bar for slower time
    frame</li>
<li>Added trailing stop Auto Strategy to pull the trigger for me (but
    doesn't seem to be working)</li>
<li>Decreased stop to 10 points on YM.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Never chase the price!</span> It's
    ok to miss some opportunities.</li>
<li>Only buy at the good end of the immediate trading range.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do chase the price with a trailing
    stop!</span></li>
<li>New money management technique: once price started to move in
    favoured direction, move stop to 2 points ahead of entry price to
    cover costs and then trail it with the price with some margin.</li>
</ol>
<p>#8 has been particularly useful today. I was wrong a couple of times in
my entry but was able to breakeven because of it. Such that even being
wrong wouldn't lose me money.</p>
<p></p>
Update: the market is down a lot and it seems to be oversold. I got in a
long position near the bottom (or so I thought). This could lose me \$50
if it keeps going down after this consolidation.</p>
<p>Update 2: I indeed did enter at near the bottom and my initial stopped
of 10 pts (\$50) were never touched. Then the price just shot up to the
resistance as expected. I gradually moved my stop to trail the price
move. This trade played out as I have planned. I made a quick \$120 or
so in the few minutes. I thought of reversing direction and go short
too. But I didn't want to push for luck for the day. However, the price
is now moving down as I have guessed. It might make a new low too. Oh
well.</p>
<p>Here's a graph a few minutes after my last trade.</p>

the news. WSJ is reporting inflation is at 17 year high. Boeing is also
delaying their 787 delivery. So many bad news indeed.</p>
<p>Yet, the Dow decides to be up today. The futures gapped lower, but it
was quickly closed to yesterday's close. I saw that one coming from the
CCI and Stoch and was able to profit on the brief rally. It seemed
obvious that the MM are positioning themselves for the big fall.</p>
<p>I exited the long and went short on very good timing. Then the market
went on a free fall for an hour. I was holding 2 shorts of YM (one for
long term entered at market top and another one for short term, which
was added on an early consolidation). The paper profit amounted to
almost \$1300 for that hour.</p>
<p>I found myself counting the profit and becoming ecstatic of the gain.
This is when my discipline lost to my conviction. CCI and Stochastic
were obviously turning upward. I originally intended the 2nd short
position to be short term only. If I stuck to my strategy, I should have
exited at least one position when the signals were staring at my face.</p>
<p>That was indeed the bottom for the day. The market recovered and
actually went higher. This is due to the HB&amp;B moving funds (gold, tech,
oil, etc) back into the financials. They are in fact
<span style="font-weight:bold;">rotating funds out of each sector</span>
one at a time so that the indexes don't tank too fast.</p>
<p>While I was so smart to call the first rally a fakeout, I totally forgot
the same could be done on the other end! It was a double trap!!! Fake
rally, fake fall, then finally settle near prev close. This is because
most "news" from today were already discounted in the previous few days'
drop in DJIA. Buy on rumour, sell on the news!</p>
<p>I continued to trade after the big lost hoping to recover. I kept on
going short near the top but the Dow kept breaking it. After a while, I
finally dawned on me. I went long on the bottom and made a little bit
back.</p>
<p>In the end, I was down about \$500 to \$600 on YM.</p>
<p>One thing I re-learned/realized is that the morning are amateurs'
market. The afternoon are the pro's market. At least, it seems easier to
trade because there seem to be less noise in the mornings for the past
few days. My strategy seemed to have worked better in the morning too.
I'll focus on the first hour or two of the market from now on and see if
this hypothesis is true.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Made one short trade today on YM with a profit of \$110. It was a very
good call, on both entry and exit timing. I went in as TRIX is above
zero and slowing down. Stochastic slow has just crossed its MA line.
Also the 5 min chart shows similar reveral signals from overbought zone.
In addition, the fundamental was good because yesterday's up run was
overzealous and unjustified (Bernanke's hint of rate cut in Feb) in a
sea of financial troubles lately. All signs pointed that today's market
would be down and the charts showed a good opportunity.</p>
<p>I exited when the stochastic bearly showed sign of upturn. The price
rebounded slightly. Another less probability chance for short came on
the 2nd mid level Stochastic cross under. I could have re-entered after
a small bounce at that point and made a lot more on the 2nd wave. Lesson
learned. When the stars are aligned, it's good to be greedy.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4hBmfY4ugI/AAAAAAAAAF0/Lok-FjE2Bm4/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][] I'm using TRIX and Stochastic Slow now. CCI gives more or less
the same signal as Stochastic but lags a bit more, so I got rid of it.
TRIX seems to complement Stochastic well because it gives a trend. I've
been working on a new system. It also has a few new tricks too. Such as
a window of opportunity feature so both signals doesn't have to happen
on exactly the same bar for the conditions to meet.</p>
<p>I watched the market for a while today but didn't make any trade
afterward. I didn't want to lose my winner from today. Plus, I prefer to
use an automatic system. So I continued to develop my new TRIX +
Stochastic system today based on these 2 days' experience.</p>
