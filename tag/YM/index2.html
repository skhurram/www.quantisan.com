            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R45YbfY4unI/AAAAAAAAAGs/qWpwUsnYojU/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][] Seemed like an obvious down day today with more write downs in
the news. WSJ is reporting inflation is at 17 year high. Boeing is also
delaying their 787 delivery. So many bad news indeed.</p>
<p>Yet, the Dow decides to be up today. The futures gapped lower, but it
was quickly closed to yesterday's close. I saw that one coming from the
CCI and Stoch and was able to profit on the brief rally. It seemed
obvious that the MM are positioning themselves for the big fall.</p>
<p>I exited the long and went short on very good timing. Then the market
went on a free fall for an hour. I was holding 2 shorts of YM (one for
long term entered at market top and another one for short term, which
was added on an early consolidation). The paper profit amounted to
almost \$1300 for that hour.</p>
<p>I found myself counting the profit and becoming ecstatic of the gain.
This is when my discipline lost to my conviction. CCI and Stochastic
were obviously turning upward. I originally intended the 2nd short
position to be short term only. If I stuck to my strategy, I should have
exited at least one position when the signals were staring at my face.</p>
<p>That was indeed the bottom for the day. The market recovered and
actually went higher. This is due to the HB&amp;B moving funds (gold, tech,
oil, etc) back into the financials. They are in fact
<span style="font-weight:bold;">rotating funds out of each sector</span>
one at a time so that the indexes don't tank too fast.</p>
<p>While I was so smart to call the first rally a fakeout, I totally forgot
the same could be done on the other end! It was a double trap!!! Fake
rally, fake fall, then finally settle near prev close. This is because
most "news" from today were already discounted in the previous few days'
drop in DJIA. Buy on rumour, sell on the news!</p>
<p>I continued to trade after the big lost hoping to recover. I kept on
going short near the top but the Dow kept breaking it. After a while, I
finally dawned on me. I went long on the bottom and made a little bit
back.</p>
<p>In the end, I was down about \$500 to \$600 on YM.</p>
<p>One thing I re-learned/realized is that the morning are amateurs'
market. The afternoon are the pro's market. At least, it seems easier to
trade because there seem to be less noise in the mornings for the past
few days. My strategy seemed to have worked better in the morning too.
I'll focus on the first hour or two of the market from now on and see if
this hypothesis is true.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Made one short trade today on YM with a profit of \$110. It was a very
good call, on both entry and exit timing. I went in as TRIX is above
zero and slowing down. Stochastic slow has just crossed its MA line.
Also the 5 min chart shows similar reveral signals from overbought zone.
In addition, the fundamental was good because yesterday's up run was
overzealous and unjustified (Bernanke's hint of rate cut in Feb) in a
sea of financial troubles lately. All signs pointed that today's market
would be down and the charts showed a good opportunity.</p>
<p>I exited when the stochastic bearly showed sign of upturn. The price
rebounded slightly. Another less probability chance for short came on
the 2nd mid level Stochastic cross under. I could have re-entered after
a small bounce at that point and made a lot more on the 2nd wave. Lesson
learned. When the stars are aligned, it's good to be greedy.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4hBmfY4ugI/AAAAAAAAAF0/Lok-FjE2Bm4/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][] I'm using TRIX and Stochastic Slow now. CCI gives more or less
the same signal as Stochastic but lags a bit more, so I got rid of it.
TRIX seems to complement Stochastic well because it gives a trend. I've
been working on a new system. It also has a few new tricks too. Such as
a window of opportunity feature so both signals doesn't have to happen
on exactly the same bar for the conditions to meet.</p>
<p>I watched the market for a while today but didn't make any trade
afterward. I didn't want to lose my winner from today. Plus, I prefer to
use an automatic system. So I continued to develop my new TRIX +
Stochastic system today based on these 2 days' experience.</p>

experience while I develop my auto system. The market I've chosen is YM
(mini Dow) for the short term, ZG (CBOT Gold) for the longer term, and
Corn for the long long term.</p>
<p>YM is on CBOT, so I wouldn't have to shell out another \$55 for the
NYMEX data. It's also a more popular/mature market than ER2 so I can
obtain fundamental analysis easier to complement my technical analysis.
The recent price action is also very predictable.</p>
<p>For example, the marked spot on the left graph is a potential strategy.
Notice the breakdown of the TRIX corresponds with an imminent breakdown
of the price. This is just one example. But observing price pattern and
TRIX pattern seems to be useful.</p>
<p>For my other two choices.</p>
<p>Gold is hot at the moment, so there could be huge swings. It's now
around \$890 and I'm expecting a correction based on the fundamentals.
I'll watch the price pattern and indicators to time my entry.</p>
<p>Corn is on a run for the past 3 months. It has low margin requirement
(\~\$1000) and the price are quite consistent. So waiting for
breakout/down can riding the trend could be a long term profitable
trade.</p>
