                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-120-slw-290/" rel='bookmark'>SOLD -120 SLW @2.90</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I sold 120 of my 366 shares of SLW just before 3pm today. I still have
246 shares. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-166-slw882-limit/">purchased 166 SLW shares way back before the crash</a> on
October 1 for ... gasp ... \$8.82. I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written about SLW</a> numerous
times and have swing traded options to make up for some of the loss
throughout these couple of months.</p>
<p>What prompted me to sell some SLW today is that Silver is up over \$1.0
to 10.487 yet SLW failed to hold on to its morning gain, see Figure 1
below. The line in the sand for me was the \$3.1 level as shown in the
hourly chart in Figure 2. Then later in the day, it failed to recapture
the \$3.0 level. I got out at \$2.90 as noted.</p>
<p>This dichotomy of rising silver price and falling SLW price shows
weakness on SLW's part. I'd like to think this is a good trade because I
had a plan and followed it. I have let my SLW shares lost 2/3 of its
value already. I am not going to let my bullish precious metal sentimet
affect my SLW trades like before.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been trying to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/?s=bottom">catch falling knives</a> for a few weeks now.
Every time I think we're at a bottom, the market rally a bit to get my
hopes up and then continue to drift down more. In retrospect, there are
so many trading no-no's I have broken with that dangerous mentality. My
account is down significantly as of this writing and I have learned many
old and new lessons throughout these weeks. In fact, I have demonstrated
improving trading <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">technique</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1190/">psychology</a> even as I was losing
money overall (what an oxymoron). Rather I'm trying to comfort myself or
not, the fact is that losing money is simply unacceptable in trading. So
I will review these trades in this post and perhaps learn something from
them.</p>
<p>As the title suggest, this is a post for post-hoc analysis of the
options which I held into expiry (3 losing and 1 winning). I'll do this
chronologically. The longest Nov09 position I have is SLW Nov 2.5 Call.
I have been a big fan of SLW as I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written and traded SLW numerous
times</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, I've annoted my charts
more than usual and will show more and write less in this post. I noted
my entry point in each trade, and labelled the stop and post-hoc <strong>ideal
exit/stop points</strong>.</p>

<p>My effective <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">entry point in my SLW Nov 2.5 Calls</a> were at SLW share
price of \$2.90 (SLW closed at \$2.81 Friday). I bought 2 Calls for
\$0.55 and at expiry, they are worth \$0.325. A loss of \$45 + \$15 for
commission as of this writing. I held on to my 2.5 calls and exercised
them, so +200 shares of SLW for me.</p>
<p>Next up is ABB on the same day. The share price for ABB was at \$10.31
when I entered. ABB closed Friday at \$9.95. I bougt the three ABB Nov
10 Calls for \$0.90. They are worth \$0.05 each. A total loss of \$255 +
\$15 for commission.</p>

<p>Then we have TCK entered at TCK share price of \$5.575. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-tck-100-nov-08-5-call-100/">bought two
TCK Nov 5 Calls for \$1.00</a> each and they are now worthless. A
complete wipeout of \$200 + \$15 commission.</p>

<p>Lastly, there's this puny winning day trade in the last 40 minute of
Friday. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/">bought a UYG Nov 3 Call for \$0.55</a> and it expired for
\$0.95. A profit of \$40 - \$15 comission, so a total of +\$25 so far. I
held on to this call and exercised it. I have +100 shares of UYG to
carry over the weekend.</p>

<p>As you can see, <strong>if only I have used trailing stops, I could have held
onto some of the profits and not turn winning trades into a losing
ones</strong>. I didn't want to let the large swing in premiums stop me out
from a big rally. That's why I didn't use trailing stop. However, the
lack of subsequent follow-through and confirmation in the rally should
have been a glaring alarm sign. I should have put in trailing stops from
this lack of strength in the rally. <strong>Any counter-trend position should
be carefully managed with tighter than usual risk management</strong>.</p>
<p>I have let my <em>undying hope for a rally</em> clouded my judgement. This
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/move-from-certainty-to-curiosity-to-improve-your-trading/">stubborn need to be right</a> is a very fundamental psychological flaw
in trading. If I can't stop doing that in the future, I might as well
quit trading manually and focus on developing my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative financial
engineering</a> work. However, as I have noted, I think I'm improving
lately and upon further reflection, I believe I have come up with a
potential methodology to correct myself in the act ... More on this as I
develop on this technique.</p>

<p>Another busy day today. I usually write up my entry/exit posts
immediately for my trades, but I needed to keep my eyes on the market
due to the fact that I went all in today.</p>
<p>I'm really tired after a long day and the fact that I went swimming
right after the close. So I'll cut myself some slack and refer you to my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-recollection-of-my-analysis-for-buying-when-sp-broke-down-to-820-today/">market analysis post from today</a> instead. Long story short, I entered
long because of the low volume retest of major support. I held because
the price and volume showed strength in testing the resistance
throughout the day.</p>
<p>I am heavy on ABB because S&amp;P broke down to 820 and ABB is still above
the Oct low of \$10. It has held on triumphantly in this leg of market
selloff. Refer to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-170/">ABB entry yesterday for a more detailed analysis
of the company</a>.</p>
<p>I added to SLW because the commodities are showing some strength too. I
have been a fan of SLW for a while, take a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">look at those posts for my
opinions of SLW</a>.</p>
<p>My plan now will be as usual, I will unload into strength starting with
my weakess position and work my way up.</p>
<p>There're a lot I want to write down, but my mind is blank now. So I'll
leave this as is.</p>

<p>The market broke my intraday support line today (pink line, first
graph). What appeared to be a good Monday turned out to be very
disappointing. I cleared the last of my short puts (i.e. long) about 5
seconds before the close when the market gained some footing. These
plays are purely for risk management purposes, each individual stock
looks ok to me to be accumulating at this level. But I'm in for the
swing trade and it haven't worked out. So I'm selling them all mainly
because the overall market looks weak.</p>
<p>To illustrate, today's intraday market data looked particularly bad. I
thought the market would turnaround after the TICK retested a -1200 low
for the day at noon on lower price, but the price continued to drift
down afterward. Then the 2pm rally didn't even break 930 (resistance
from yesterday) too. That was the last draw for me and I decided to exit
all risky positions from then on to minimize my risk. So I covered all
my options into the close.</p>
<p>The first of which was Dec SLW 5 put at 15:48 for \$1.70, which I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-3-slw-100-dec-08-5-put-155/">bought at \$1.55</a>. I still have my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-166-slw882-limit/">166 shares of SLW</a>, so it's an
obvious choice for me to unload the options. I don't want to be too
heavy on precious metal for now. SLW is still holding the \$3.4 level
and marked a higher low in the afternoon. So it's actually looking good.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_674" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>Next I sold FRO at 15:59:27. The low of today looks like a test of a
daily trendline, pink line below on the right daily graph (Update: I
forgot to attach the graph. I added it a day later below). I normally
would have only sold if it breaks it, but again, the market looks bad.
So a retest of \$30 (highest volume in recent months) seems possible. I
covered the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fro-100-nov-08-40-put-790/">FRO short puts bought at \$7.90</a> for \$8.00. On another
note, I mistakenly placed a sell order on the put rather than a buy (to
cover) at \$8.10. So I quickly covered that accidental trade at \$8.30
regardless of that fact that FRO was moving up at that time. I've
learned my lesson in accidental orders and would cover immediately
regardless. I won't try to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-58-caf-2889-limit/">convince myself like my CAF trade</a>.</p>

<p>I covered my Nov <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-wfc-100-nov-08-31-put-360/">WFC short put bought at \$3.60</a> for \$3.00 at
15:59:55. Fee \$7.50.</p>
<p>I almost didn't want to give up my WFC position. It was the strongest
and the one most profitable of my Friday's swing trades. In particular,
last Friday's turnaround has by far the most volume in several months.
The \$28.0 support looks almost impenetrable. Indeed, today's low of
\$28.04 looks safe and we only tested it at very low volume. Indeed, I
really don't think we'll see this low again in the short term. Looking
at this more carefully now, maybe I should leave it open ... Oh well, I
can always get back in.</p>
