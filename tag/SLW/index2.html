<p>Another busy day today. I usually write up my entry/exit posts
immediately for my trades, but I needed to keep my eyes on the market
due to the fact that I went all in today.</p>
<p>I'm really tired after a long day and the fact that I went swimming
right after the close. So I'll cut myself some slack and refer you to my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-recollection-of-my-analysis-for-buying-when-sp-broke-down-to-820-today/">market analysis post from today</a> instead. Long story short, I entered
long because of the low volume retest of major support. I held because
the price and volume showed strength in testing the resistance
throughout the day.</p>
<p>I am heavy on ABB because S&amp;P broke down to 820 and ABB is still above
the Oct low of \$10. It has held on triumphantly in this leg of market
selloff. Refer to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-170/">ABB entry yesterday for a more detailed analysis
of the company</a>.</p>
<p>I added to SLW because the commodities are showing some strength too. I
have been a fan of SLW for a while, take a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">look at those posts for my
opinions of SLW</a>.</p>
<p>My plan now will be as usual, I will unload into strength starting with
my weakess position and work my way up.</p>
<p>There're a lot I want to write down, but my mind is blank now. So I'll
leave this as is.</p>

<p>The market broke my intraday support line today (pink line, first
graph). What appeared to be a good Monday turned out to be very
disappointing. I cleared the last of my short puts (i.e. long) about 5
seconds before the close when the market gained some footing. These
plays are purely for risk management purposes, each individual stock
looks ok to me to be accumulating at this level. But I'm in for the
swing trade and it haven't worked out. So I'm selling them all mainly
because the overall market looks weak.</p>
<p>To illustrate, today's intraday market data looked particularly bad. I
thought the market would turnaround after the TICK retested a -1200 low
for the day at noon on lower price, but the price continued to drift
down afterward. Then the 2pm rally didn't even break 930 (resistance
from yesterday) too. That was the last draw for me and I decided to exit
all risky positions from then on to minimize my risk. So I covered all
my options into the close.</p>
<p>The first of which was Dec SLW 5 put at 15:48 for \$1.70, which I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-3-slw-100-dec-08-5-put-155/">bought at \$1.55</a>. I still have my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-166-slw882-limit/">166 shares of SLW</a>, so it's an
obvious choice for me to unload the options. I don't want to be too
heavy on precious metal for now. SLW is still holding the \$3.4 level
and marked a higher low in the afternoon. So it's actually looking good.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_674" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>Next I sold FRO at 15:59:27. The low of today looks like a test of a
daily trendline, pink line below on the right daily graph (Update: I
forgot to attach the graph. I added it a day later below). I normally
would have only sold if it breaks it, but again, the market looks bad.
So a retest of \$30 (highest volume in recent months) seems possible. I
covered the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fro-100-nov-08-40-put-790/">FRO short puts bought at \$7.90</a> for \$8.00. On another
note, I mistakenly placed a sell order on the put rather than a buy (to
cover) at \$8.10. So I quickly covered that accidental trade at \$8.30
regardless of that fact that FRO was moving up at that time. I've
learned my lesson in accidental orders and would cover immediately
regardless. I won't try to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-58-caf-2889-limit/">convince myself like my CAF trade</a>.</p>

<p>I covered my Nov <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-wfc-100-nov-08-31-put-360/">WFC short put bought at \$3.60</a> for \$3.00 at
15:59:55. Fee \$7.50.</p>
<p>I almost didn't want to give up my WFC position. It was the strongest
and the one most profitable of my Friday's swing trades. In particular,
last Friday's turnaround has by far the most volume in several months.
The \$28.0 support looks almost impenetrable. Indeed, today's low of
\$28.04 looks safe and we only tested it at very low volume. Indeed, I
really don't think we'll see this low again in the short term. Looking
at this more carefully now, maybe I should leave it open ... Oh well, I
can always get back in.</p>

<p>Short puts on Dec SLW stroke 5 for \$1.55.</p>
<p>Upside: The move from \$4 to \$3.78 was low volume and \$3.78 is a
support level from yesterday. S&amp;P also dropped from 940 to 920 and
stayed there for a bit on low volume.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$4</p>
<p>Downside: Silver price down slightly. Market in short term down trend.</p>
<p>Support: \$3.7.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is a short term trade with a small position to test
the water. Mental stop is S&amp;P 916.</p>
<p>Update: S&amp;P dipped to 913 briefly then returned to 917 level. I was
hungry so I went to lunch and left this as is. S&amp;P is back to 920+ level
after an hour. I think I will let this play out without hugging the
monitor every minute. I've got other work to do.</p>

<p>Covered my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-5-slw-100-dec08-75-put-400-lmt/">short puts SLW @ \$4.00</a> for \$3.40 today. Fee \$7.50.</p>
<p>This is to reduce my risk on the current weak precious metal market.
Silver is failing to break above \$10.6 so far. Gold is down \$14 or so
to below \$750, an important support level.</p>
<p>The weakness seen today after the election is likely a shakeout for an
imminent rally. However, my leveraged position in SLW is too risky due
to weakness in both the equity and precious metal markets, even for the
short term. So I'm unloading it for now to wait for a re-entry. My
strategy with the options is to hold it as short as possible for the
most profit. So I'll be taking swing positions and trade in and out.</p>
<p>In any case, I still have my SLW shares to ride the wave if we do make a
move.</p>
<p>Update: S&amp;P is down 33 to 972 from around 988 when I sold. Yet, SLW is
holding up nicely. This is a very good sign for SLW.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>While I haven't written about my stance on the flood of bailouts, I have
been against it all along. Pouring tax payers' <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122540927284586151.html">money into a select few
elites</a> in the name of <em>helping</em> the economy has sank my respect for
the American government to a new low. This is just like the Bush's
Weapons of Mass Destruction lies and the subsequent Iraq invasion all
over again, only on an epic scale and the effect much more encompassing.
However, the situation have reached a new low. In today's news, there's
talk of banks asking for credit card debt forgiveness. They might as
well just hand out each American a million dollar cheque. Then watch the
American dollar become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar">Zimbobwe money</a> and plunge America back to the
Medieval era when people would barter for their goods. The sheer
stupidity of this move is below even that of Bush's intelligence! If
what the U.S.A. is doing lately isn't socialism, then I don't know what
is. That is one huge factor why I've been long gold and silver with my
accumulating position in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">SLW</a>. It looks as though we might be in for
a continued downtrend in precious metal prices. But sooner or later,
prices will reflect their true values. Update: The Big Picture made a
post about <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/10/moral-hazard-of.html">mortgage bailouts</a> today on the same issue. Barry puts the
issue of bailing out bad debts succinctly, "moral hazard not only
encourages recklessness, it leads to people looking to avoid
responsibility for bad decisions."</p> </div>

<p>Wrote some puts on Dec08 of SLW at 7.5 strike price. Fee \$7.5.</p>
<p>Upside: Volume on the rally from the low has been consistently high.
Price of silver looks as though it has seen the low for now. Note the
volume graph on 15-min YI price, the retest of last Friday's high
occurred at lower volume, marked by yellow line.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$4 first, then primary at \$5. Next up is \$9 - \$10.</p>
<p>Downside: Week prior to election, rally not supported by volume on
overall market. Earnings report on Monday. Commodities under pressure.</p>
<p>Support: \$3.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: Can't say for sure if we're at the bottom yet. The
sentiment is definitely turning. By now til late December, SLW and the
overall market should make a sizable rally. I will unload this then.</p>
<p>Stop: If on expirary I'm being <em>put to</em>, then I might just pony up the
cash and buy the shares. Effective share price will be \$3.5.</p>
