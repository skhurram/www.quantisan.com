            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=a0r3UGqnHprg">World Bank forecast released today</a> is putting severe pressure on
equities and commodities.</p>
<p>SLW is testing a long term support at \$8.05, Figure 1 and 2. This SLW
resistance correspond with a long term support of e-mini Silver at
\$13.85 (Figure 3).</p>
<p>(My entry stop just got triggered as I was typing this.)</p>
<p>Long entry stop: \$8.15, intraday resistance</p>
<p>Exit stop: \$8.05, long term support</p>
<p>Target: \$9.60, bottom of recent acending channel</p>
<p>Reward / Risk = 1.55 / 0.1 = 15.5 > 5.0</p>
<p>As Bill noted in his weekly review, we only have <a href="http://caracommunity.com/content/week-review-25-2009">7 sessions left until
the end of quarter</a>. It would seem that the market wouldn't tank in
the last few days just so companies can paint a pretty picture that all
is well and recovering in their quarterly report.</p>
<p>Update 11:38am: My exit stop at \$8.05 was triggered and I'm out of the
position. I'll wait until end of the day to see if I should re-enter
this position.</p>
<p>Update: I re-entered my long at 12:52 for \$8.06. New stop is \$7.90, a
support from a couple weeks ago. I'll move my stop up if we move above
\$8.20.</p>
<p>Update June 23: I was stopped out at \$7.90 at 10:31.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Blood on the market again. I've dumped my SLW since it broke my stop of
\$5.30 cleanly at the open. I wouldn't touch it again until SLW can
clear above \$5.40 or below \$4.70.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-120-slw-573/">bought this position for \$5.73</a> a few days ago. That's a net loss,
with commission, of \$49.60. Add to the fact that SLW once rose to
\$6.40 between now and when I bought. I have once again let profits turn
to losses.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the low volume top on Jan 9th followed by a gap downthe
next day should be strong warning sign. Then a hard stop should be
placed at the support of Jan 10th at about \$5.65.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Bought some SLW to balance my portfolio. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-246-slw-664028/">sold all my SLW</a> last week
and still <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-34-dug-2344-and-bought-10-skf-104125/">held on to my short hedge</a>. So I was heavy on the short
side since the weekend.</p>
<p>We had the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/post-market-analysis-jan-7-2009/">first 2009 down day</a> on the market today. But SLW held on
to its support level and the last few minutes saw some heavy buying. So
I'm taking a small position in SLW to test the water. I will keep a
tight stop on this trade as my indicators are showing further downside.</p>
<p>In other words, the short term price action looked positive today but my
indicators are showing a negative move for the intermediate term.</p>

<p>Furthermore, silver prices seem to be edging higher. We just tested the
20 day MA again. Lately, silver has been gliding along its 20 day MA.
But we saw significant volume today on this test of support, so there's
a good chance we might break down from here. That's another reason why
I'm keeping a tight stop on this trade.</p>

<p>Upside: Tested 20 day MA. Good last few minute up trades. Both 20-day
and 50-day MA are positive.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$7</p>
<p>Downside: Indicators show intermediate-term weakness. Possible double
top with negative divergence.</p>
<p>Support: \$5.50. (This will be my mental stop for this trade.)</p>
<p>Bottom line: I'm adding a small long position here to balance my
portfolio. As of this writing, I am net neutral with my portfolio. The
idea is to have both feet in the water and then add to strength as the
market unfolds.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After holding SLW for a few weeks, I'm finally out for now. I have
traded in and out of SLW for the past few months. So there isn't an
exact price and date of entry for these 246 shares. The effective
purchase price was about \$3.50.</p>
<p>As I noted more than a few times in the past, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">I love SLW</a>. I intended
to hold it as my core position for the long term. However, as I have
learned the hard way, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/auto-bailout-shakeout-december-13-2008/">buy-and-hold isn't an effective strategy</a> in
the current market condition. So I've decided to sell my SLW on some
significant weakness.</p>
<p>From Figure 1, SLW has tested the long term resistance (from 2007) of
\$7 twice recently. We still haven't broken it despite <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2008-post-holiday-market-analysis/">S&amp;P 500 breaking
its own resistance</a>. Moreover, we can see from Figure 2 that this
second top is a lot weaker across the indicators. So this is effectively
a double top formation, for now.</p>
<p>I still have my reserve on this because it is a holiday week, so low
volume is expected. Thus, I would watch for SLW's action next week and
see if it can break \$7 and then get back in at a higher price. I'd
rather miss out on a \$1 or even \$2 than watch it make a double top. I
have nearly doubled on this trade so I'm just trying not to be greedy.</p>
<p>However, there is a possibility that we might gap up from here and
rocket higher next week. If that's the case, I will probably not chase
it and look for another trade (TCK looks good).</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I sold 120 of my 366 shares of SLW just before 3pm today. I still have
246 shares. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-166-slw882-limit/">purchased 166 SLW shares way back before the crash</a> on
October 1 for ... gasp ... \$8.82. I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written about SLW</a> numerous
times and have swing traded options to make up for some of the loss
throughout these couple of months.</p>
<p>What prompted me to sell some SLW today is that Silver is up over \$1.0
to 10.487 yet SLW failed to hold on to its morning gain, see Figure 1
below. The line in the sand for me was the \$3.1 level as shown in the
hourly chart in Figure 2. Then later in the day, it failed to recapture
the \$3.0 level. I got out at \$2.90 as noted.</p>
<p>This dichotomy of rising silver price and falling SLW price shows
weakness on SLW's part. I'd like to think this is a good trade because I
had a plan and followed it. I have let my SLW shares lost 2/3 of its
value already. I am not going to let my bullish precious metal sentimet
affect my SLW trades like before.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been trying to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/?s=bottom">catch falling knives</a> for a few weeks now.
Every time I think we're at a bottom, the market rally a bit to get my
hopes up and then continue to drift down more. In retrospect, there are
so many trading no-no's I have broken with that dangerous mentality. My
account is down significantly as of this writing and I have learned many
old and new lessons throughout these weeks. In fact, I have demonstrated
improving trading <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">technique</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1190/">psychology</a> even as I was losing
money overall (what an oxymoron). Rather I'm trying to comfort myself or
not, the fact is that losing money is simply unacceptable in trading. So
I will review these trades in this post and perhaps learn something from
them.</p>
<p>As the title suggest, this is a post for post-hoc analysis of the
options which I held into expiry (3 losing and 1 winning). I'll do this
chronologically. The longest Nov09 position I have is SLW Nov 2.5 Call.
I have been a big fan of SLW as I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written and traded SLW numerous
times</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, I've annoted my charts
more than usual and will show more and write less in this post. I noted
my entry point in each trade, and labelled the stop and post-hoc <strong>ideal
exit/stop points</strong>.</p>

<p>My effective <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">entry point in my SLW Nov 2.5 Calls</a> were at SLW share
price of \$2.90 (SLW closed at \$2.81 Friday). I bought 2 Calls for
\$0.55 and at expiry, they are worth \$0.325. A loss of \$45 + \$15 for
commission as of this writing. I held on to my 2.5 calls and exercised
them, so +200 shares of SLW for me.</p>
<p>Next up is ABB on the same day. The share price for ABB was at \$10.31
when I entered. ABB closed Friday at \$9.95. I bougt the three ABB Nov
10 Calls for \$0.90. They are worth \$0.05 each. A total loss of \$255 +
\$15 for commission.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_858" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>Then we have TCK entered at TCK share price of \$5.575. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-tck-100-nov-08-5-call-100/">bought two
TCK Nov 5 Calls for \$1.00</a> each and they are now worthless. A
complete wipeout of \$200 + \$15 commission.</p>

<p>Lastly, there's this puny winning day trade in the last 40 minute of
Friday. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/">bought a UYG Nov 3 Call for \$0.55</a> and it expired for
\$0.95. A profit of \$40 - \$15 comission, so a total of +\$25 so far. I
held on to this call and exercised it. I have +100 shares of UYG to
carry over the weekend.</p>

<p>As you can see, <strong>if only I have used trailing stops, I could have held
onto some of the profits and not turn winning trades into a losing
ones</strong>. I didn't want to let the large swing in premiums stop me out
from a big rally. That's why I didn't use trailing stop. However, the
lack of subsequent follow-through and confirmation in the rally should
have been a glaring alarm sign. I should have put in trailing stops from
this lack of strength in the rally. <strong>Any counter-trend position should
be carefully managed with tighter than usual risk management</strong>.</p>
<p>I have let my <em>undying hope for a rally</em> clouded my judgement. This
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/move-from-certainty-to-curiosity-to-improve-your-trading/">stubborn need to be right</a> is a very fundamental psychological flaw
in trading. If I can't stop doing that in the future, I might as well
quit trading manually and focus on developing my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative financial
engineering</a> work. However, as I have noted, I think I'm improving
lately and upon further reflection, I believe I have come up with a
potential methodology to correct myself in the act ... More on this as I
develop on this technique.</p>
