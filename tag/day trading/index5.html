            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5fFeBzQQTI/AAAAAAAAAJE/cPw6Txz0lV4/s400/ymday.jpg" />][] Dow opened about 200 points lower today, the news were saying
it'd be another down day. But most traders know better. We might be at a
short term bottom at the moment because of the Fed intervention. By
about noon, the market bottomed out to a new low and started to pick up.
The rally went into full gear at almost exactly 3pm (ET) on a rally with
little breathing room for short covering. This was quite expected and
the signals were clear after the noon bottom.</p>
<p>However, this is where I was caught. My first 2 hours of trading were
great. I was up over \$200. Then in the mid-day, even when I was right
about the direction of the market, I ended up down about \$350 because
of all the choppy actions. In addition, I should be more confident of my
belief in a rally because of the obvious uptrend. Yet, the market acted
as if it's going to plunge.</p>
<p>As you can see from the graph above, I got into many trades in the
middle of the day. But not all of them were losing trades. I saw that
the market was in a trading range and profitted from fading the
breakouts. That made me a bit of money, but a few bad trades got me into
the negative.</p>
<p>I wasn't too happy to see my account under \$15,000 in the afternoon.
However, one thing I did well was regain my composure and got back into
the game with a clear mind. I had put my lost behind and only strived to
minimize risk in my later trades.</p>
<p>Fortunately, near the end of the day, a real rally broke out as
expected. I didn't get excited and chased the price. Instead, I waited
my opportunity on a retracement and got into a long. That one last trade
made back all my loses. Even though my short term entry and exit were ok
on this trade. I should have entered another long position on the 2nd
retracement for the 2nd longer leg in the rally to double up on my long
position. I could have made at least another \$1000 or so if I had done
that.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">So three lessons from today</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't waste my time on low reward trade. Only enter trades if I
    expect the reward to be a few times (at least 3) more than my stop.</li>
<li>Be careful in the mid-day when only the pros are swimming. Better
    yet, only trade in first 2 and last 1 hours.</li>
<li>When I am right, raise the stake in the pot! i.e. average up!</li>
</ol>

The market was bound for a small rally. So the Dow moved from a negative
400 something point to almost breakeven and then closed down a 100 pts.
There were many wild swings today. Many opportunities for a day trader.</p>
<p>Although I seem to have done well today, I think I could have done a lot
better.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5avoBzQQOI/AAAAAAAAAIc/8w-84LbudSE/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][]Even though I knew the Dow is going to go up at least 200 pts
from open, I only captured about 150 points of it. I was hesitating a
lot after my winnings because I worried about losing my profits like I
did before. I need to be objective in my rationale.</p>
<p>However, the later day action were a lot choppier and the ATR were a lot
higher. Staying on the sideline may be a good decision. For my later
trades in a volatile setting, I may want to increase my stop because I
have missed a few good trades even though I was ultimately right.</p>
<p>On the other hand, my exits were a lot better today. I wasn't bagholding
nor was I ragholding. I got out when I should rather I was winning or
losing. In addition, my tight trailing stop method saved me a few times.
Although it did got me out too early a few times too.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have adopted this new screen which I developed over the
weekend. It's based on the triple screen strategy by Dr. Alexander
Elder. The big window is for my main time frame. Then two more charts
for a 5x higher and another for a 5x shorter time frames. I only enter a
trade when all 3 (at least the lower 2's) are in sync. Then I exit when
either the short or current time period shows weakness.</p>

expecting that Bush's speech on a stimulus package would cause a mini
rally to squeeze the shorts. So I kept entering trades on the Buy
signals. As you can see from the graph, it didn't happen. Stupid me. The
parameter is definitely too loose at the moment on the Buy signal. I
have adjusted it now and it seems to be a bit better (fewer false
positives).</p>
<p>I also shouldn't read too much into comments from Bill Cara's blog. Both
times I went against my own judgement because of reading too much of
other people's comments led to big losses. Lesson is to
<span style="font-weight:bold;">never have any expectation of the
market</span>. See what the price is doing and interpret it based on
that, and that alone. End of story.</p>
<p>In total, I think I'm down about a \$500 from my YM day trading for the
past couple of weeks. If there's any consolation, I think my system is
improving from these failures.</p>

to filter out the noise. It's also because I found that I'm not quick
trigger enough on fast times. I'm using 1200 contracts/bar at the
moment. It seems to be good. I'm also a lot more disciplined today. Not
over trading and sticking to my strategy. At the very least, my recent
loses have given me valuable experiences in day trading. Also, the floor
pivot points have been very reliable so far. The price seems to like to
bounce around these levels or settle in a range near them. Very useful
in identifying breakouts or exhaustions.</p>
<p>Here are some changes I added to my day trading screen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implemented my CCI and Stochastic strategy into a PaintBar with
    alarms</li>
<li>Added Stochastic crossing of oversold or overbought as ShowMe with
    alarms</li>
<li>Increased contracts/bar to 1200 contracts / bar for slower time
    frame</li>
<li>Added trailing stop Auto Strategy to pull the trigger for me (but
    doesn't seem to be working)</li>
<li>Decreased stop to 10 points on YM.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Never chase the price!</span> It's
    ok to miss some opportunities.</li>
<li>Only buy at the good end of the immediate trading range.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do chase the price with a trailing
    stop!</span></li>
<li>New money management technique: once price started to move in
    favoured direction, move stop to 2 points ahead of entry price to
    cover costs and then trail it with the price with some margin.</li>
</ol>
<p>#8 has been particularly useful today. I was wrong a couple of times in
my entry but was able to breakeven because of it. Such that even being
wrong wouldn't lose me money.</p>
<p></p>
Update: the market is down a lot and it seems to be oversold. I got in a
long position near the bottom (or so I thought). This could lose me \$50
if it keeps going down after this consolidation.</p>
<p>Update 2: I indeed did enter at near the bottom and my initial stopped
of 10 pts (\$50) were never touched. Then the price just shot up to the
resistance as expected. I gradually moved my stop to trail the price
move. This trade played out as I have planned. I made a quick \$120 or
so in the few minutes. I thought of reversing direction and go short
too. But I didn't want to push for luck for the day. However, the price
is now moving down as I have guessed. It might make a new low too. Oh
well.</p>
<p>Here's a graph a few minutes after my last trade.</p>
