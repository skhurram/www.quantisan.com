            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R45YbfY4unI/AAAAAAAAAGs/qWpwUsnYojU/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][] Seemed like an obvious down day today with more write downs in
the news. WSJ is reporting inflation is at 17 year high. Boeing is also
delaying their 787 delivery. So many bad news indeed.</p>
<p>Yet, the Dow decides to be up today. The futures gapped lower, but it
was quickly closed to yesterday's close. I saw that one coming from the
CCI and Stoch and was able to profit on the brief rally. It seemed
obvious that the MM are positioning themselves for the big fall.</p>
<p>I exited the long and went short on very good timing. Then the market
went on a free fall for an hour. I was holding 2 shorts of YM (one for
long term entered at market top and another one for short term, which
was added on an early consolidation). The paper profit amounted to
almost \$1300 for that hour.</p>
<p>I found myself counting the profit and becoming ecstatic of the gain.
This is when my discipline lost to my conviction. CCI and Stochastic
were obviously turning upward. I originally intended the 2nd short
position to be short term only. If I stuck to my strategy, I should have
exited at least one position when the signals were staring at my face.</p>
<p>That was indeed the bottom for the day. The market recovered and
actually went higher. This is due to the HB&amp;B moving funds (gold, tech,
oil, etc) back into the financials. They are in fact
<span style="font-weight:bold;">rotating funds out of each sector</span>
one at a time so that the indexes don't tank too fast.</p>
<p>While I was so smart to call the first rally a fakeout, I totally forgot
the same could be done on the other end! It was a double trap!!! Fake
rally, fake fall, then finally settle near prev close. This is because
most "news" from today were already discounted in the previous few days'
drop in DJIA. Buy on rumour, sell on the news!</p>
<p>I continued to trade after the big lost hoping to recover. I kept on
going short near the top but the Dow kept breaking it. After a while, I
finally dawned on me. I went long on the bottom and made a little bit
back.</p>
<p>In the end, I was down about \$500 to \$600 on YM.</p>
<p>One thing I re-learned/realized is that the morning are amateurs'
market. The afternoon are the pro's market. At least, it seems easier to
trade because there seem to be less noise in the mornings for the past
few days. My strategy seemed to have worked better in the morning too.
I'll focus on the first hour or two of the market from now on and see if
this hypothesis is true.</p>

<li>day traded YM again, ended up about \$55 for the day with 4 trades.</li>
<li>Stochastic slow crossing oversold/bought line seems to be a pretty
    good indicator. I combined it with CCI smoothed and look at the
    underlying trend to catch retracements.</li>
<li>worked a bit on the system again, but the market changes too much,
    difficult to make a catch-all system that can be consistent. I will
    continue trading manually to gain experience.</li>
<li>installed the eKam Hesitation indicator</li>
<li>Examined swing trading soybean. My system seems to work well there
    too. But risk/reward only = 10, daily range / intraday range.
    Whereas YM's risk/reward is 20. But YM is more choppy lately and S
    is swinging well.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Lesson:</span> Don't focus on
    profit. Concentrate on managing risk and the money will follow.</li>
<li>Entered a short position of YM at \$897.10 with stop at \$902.6
    (just above resistance)</li>
</ol>
<p>Yesterday I was day trading too. Up about \$100. I've been working on
the system for the past couple of days, disappointing results. On the
other hand, I'm getting better at day trading and this seems like a
better method.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Made one short trade today on YM with a profit of \$110. It was a very
good call, on both entry and exit timing. I went in as TRIX is above
zero and slowing down. Stochastic slow has just crossed its MA line.
Also the 5 min chart shows similar reveral signals from overbought zone.
In addition, the fundamental was good because yesterday's up run was
overzealous and unjustified (Bernanke's hint of rate cut in Feb) in a
sea of financial troubles lately. All signs pointed that today's market
would be down and the charts showed a good opportunity.</p>
<p>I exited when the stochastic bearly showed sign of upturn. The price
rebounded slightly. Another less probability chance for short came on
the 2nd mid level Stochastic cross under. I could have re-entered after
a small bounce at that point and made a lot more on the 2nd wave. Lesson
learned. When the stars are aligned, it's good to be greedy.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4hBmfY4ugI/AAAAAAAAAF0/Lok-FjE2Bm4/s400/ym_day.jpg" />][] I'm using TRIX and Stochastic Slow now. CCI gives more or less
the same signal as Stochastic but lags a bit more, so I got rid of it.
TRIX seems to complement Stochastic well because it gives a trend. I've
been working on a new system. It also has a few new tricks too. Such as
a window of opportunity feature so both signals doesn't have to happen
on exactly the same bar for the conditions to meet.</p>
<p>I watched the market for a while today but didn't make any trade
afterward. I didn't want to lose my winner from today. Plus, I prefer to
use an automatic system. So I continued to develop my new TRIX +
Stochastic system today based on these 2 days' experience.</p>

trading today. It started pretty bad as my emotion and lack of a
definitive strategy resulted in a couple of big losses and excessive
trading early in the day (see chart below). One thing I've done well
that saved me from a probably whipout was cutting my losses short. I was
on the wrong side a couple of times before the spikes, but I was able to
hit the "close all" button despite seeing some big paper losses already.
Those decisions turned out well as I would have been down even more if I
wasn't decisive.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4aPevY4ufI/AAAAAAAAAFs/am0y9aCWTXI/s400/ym_daytrade_perf.jpg" />][]</p>

became more and more successful. I nearly brokeeven but a few
"out-of-strategy" trade (bad!) put me back deep into the red again. A
few key concepts that I need to remind myself again and again are as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>PATIENCE!</li>
<li>Wait for the right signals for HIGH probability trades. It's ok to
    miss some moves!</li>
<li>Cut losses short and take profit SLOWLY. Stick with strategy on both
    entries and exits.</li>
<li>Don't over-trade!</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's the final screen I used for day trading today. I went through a
few versions as the day went by already. This particular screen and
strategy seems to perform well.</p>
<p></p>
[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R4aLH_Y4ucI/AAAAAAAAAFU/PULeXcMHETw/s400/ym_daytrade.jpg" />][] On a positive note, the strategy I developed from today's
experience using trial and error is invaluable. I think this can be
programmed into a mechanical system. More on this later after I've done
my trade analysis.</p>
<p>For now, I need some rest!</p>
