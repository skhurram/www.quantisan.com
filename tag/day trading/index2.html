went to bed. I was too tired and found that I wasn't concentrating. My
brain was definitely off already.</p>
<p>I seriously considered entering a long at about the vertical line. Then
after watching it for a few bars, the price seems to be stuck in a
trading range, so it could go either way. Since I didn't want to wait
for long because I almost fell asleep at the table, I decided to not
enter a position. It was a good decision because the price would have
went below my stop (lowest of past few bars in the trading range) before
rising just a 6 index points, and with a lot of struggle too.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day, there were a lot of choppiness and not a lot of
big swings. It would have been better to stay off the market because my
stops would have been killed.</p>
<p>Although I didn't make any profit for the day, I didn't lose any either.
So I think going to bed early last because I wasn't up for it was a wise
decision.</p>

wait for the right moment. I almost entered my 4th trade but didn't
because I wanted to stick to my rule, at least for the first day.

<p>I think I'm finally learning that it's not worth it to get into small
moves. The reward/risk ratio is usually not good. And those are usually
the emotional trades too, where I somehow convinced myself the price is
going to move that way. [<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6yCfxzQQ1I/AAAAAAAAANs/jIfly4pLVqg/s400/er2_rpt.jpg" />][]</p>

two weeks in Canada. I could blame it on the fact that I'm not used to
trading at night and that I was very tired also because of jet lag.
However, I shouldn't have traded at all if I knew that I wasn't in good
condition.</p>
<p>Perhaps the thinking that caused me to trade so many times is that I
didn't want to miss any opportunities. I move in too fast before the
signals are mature. Thus, one thing I need to do is don't guess where
the market is moving. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Let the signals
mature and the price to move a bit first before entering; I don't have
to get in and out at exactly the top and bottom of a swing</span>.</p>
<p>For the moment, I am imposing a 3 trades maximum rule to restrain myself
until I'm producing better results and am more disciplined.</p>

had a good day today and covered my losses from yesterday. Good days
always seem to come after a bad day. I think it's probably because I'm
more calm after a losing day. So now, I just need to maintain my
composure even if I'm up.</p>
<p>MBIA had a conference call today and told everyone everything's still
good even though they are reporting a \$2.3bln loss last quarter! Go
figure! Someone at BillCara is suggesting that the fund managers are
proping the market because it's the last day of the month. Just so they
can have a positive January.</p>
<p>I traded the pre-market signal as intended and it paid off. The gap
closed as expected but I <span style="font-weight:bold;">exited too
early</span> again. If only I held longer, my profits would have been in
the 4 figures today.</p>
<p>I did well today, entering trades only when the risk/reward ratio is
deemed worthwhile. In addition, I am making use of resistance and
support levels. I think this helped a lot.</p>
<p>However, I think I need to be quicker on my decision. I found that many
times, I was still pondering should I enter and then the price have
moved already. On the other hand, my exit trigger is a bit too fast
because I'm still not letting my profit run. Thus, I think I need to
automate some of my decision making process (like adding some ShowMe's)
rather than just eyeballing my indicators. One idea I'm having is tune
my fast time period with an appropriate ShowMe. This should be something
simple. I am thinking of implementing a ShowMe for local high/low with
stochastic divergence as setup.</p>

for later analysis.</p>
<div id="c43346">
</p>
Stu: If I may..dont guess the market direction.!!

Just trade with the trend between support and resistance zones. Let the
market tell you direction...dont guess...trade with a 'no mind' (thats
from the last samurai movie):).

i.e.e dont think too much, think when you are doing your homework at
night or pre-market, not during trading.

Try This. On your monitor...put up 3 charts. 1) \$SPX 2) Breadth chart
like \$ NYAD or \$NYSE advancing issues, add a 10period moving ave on a
3 or 5 min chart. 3) The chart of what you are trading, I guess the XLF.

Before market moving events. take the \$SPX chart ..start with the
weekly time frame . Draw all key resistance and support zones. the
nearest resistance zone today was around \$spx 1385ish.

Go to your dailies..nearest resistance..1380ish, go to a 5 day 5 minute
chart, and draw a line connecting the two most prominent pivot lows.
Hopefully the line extends as you trade, dont know your platform. That
tells you resistance 1380ish, support 1350ish. No worries with market
direction, or size of rate cut.

Now you know 2 potential reversal points. now trade within it by
following the trend of the rbeadth chart.if the breadth is trading above
the 10moving average..go long. if below go short.

if the 10 moving average is flat on the breadth chart..stay out..its
likely to be a congestion zone.low reward to risk.

FOMC announces...irrelevant..market direction matters ..follow your
market breadth chart. The first reaction..look at your breadth chart
dont look at prices. look at MARKET DIRECTION.

3 steps FOMC announcement..1)knee-jerk..2)counter knee jerk...then
3)trade direction . market trends up and reverses at \$SPX 1380
ish.which coincides with XLF reversal ( there is also a RSI bearish
divergence, AND a long red bar).sell your UYG, go long SKF.... 2 large
directional moves.

Now you have your lines markng \$SPX resistance, the trendline from the
last two lows, RSI bearish divergence on XLF and a red candlestick at
resistance on the \$SPX..confirming exit LONG.

Why isnt it just a pullback ?..the candlesticks stays below the 10EMA
with 2 long cascading long bars( as opposed to inisde bars) .Layer your
Short trades in.

Stay in the trend as long as it stays below the 10 moveing ave...add to
your position if any pullback does not cross the 10 move ave..

Sell at \$SPX support. I didnt..I got out at todays lows...

I have a few other ETFs..they follow \$SPX support n Resistance...XLF is
one of them.

P/s It helps if you use candlestick reversal patterns . which is showing
a reversal on the daily \$SPX..lets see what the market says tommorow.

<p>
Good luck ..this is a friendly tape for day traders...just stay out of
congestion zones.

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6DarxzQQjI/AAAAAAAAALc/MuuFkCxOuQU/s400/er2_daygraph.jpg" />][]A hell of a ride today from the FOMC at 2:15pm. The day was
pretty quiet before the announcement. Then at about 2:14pm, the price
broke up because the FED lowered interest rate another 50 pts to 3% as
expected.</p>
<p>I tried my scalping strategy explained a few days ago, it didn't work!
After losing about \$1000 in the past week on these scalping trades, I
think it's time to admit that I suck at it and stop doing it! A few
bucks here and a few there accumulated so quickly.
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Until I have thoroughly developed and
backtested a strategy, I should not use it in trading.</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, my Keltner + Stochastic strategy is working well. The
only problem now is that I need to be more confident about it and let my
profit run. See this graph below of this fading trade I took after the
price shot up on the FED outcome. I knew that it's going to come back
down to fill the gap. And I knew that I shouldn't be reading my fast
time frame. Instead, if I enter on the intermediate time frame, then I
should exit on the intermediate time frame too. I knew that the bounce
would take us to the other side of the channel but I exited way too
early because I looked at my fast time frame and lost confident.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6DcshzQQkI/AAAAAAAAALk/Tb9XerDhN7A/s400/er2_dive.jpg" />][] The reason is that earlier today, I had full intention of
waiting for exit signal on the intermediate time frame, but the \$200
bounce ended up to be fake and I closed out at a little loss on that
trade. The price movement seemed the same at the time of my exit, so
that spooked me out of a potential \$700 more profit. I really shouldn't
let my loses cloud my judgement. I should just learn from it and move
on. In hindsight, the difference is that this afternoon trade had a HUGE
run prior to it and my CCI + Stochastic signal was on too, whereas the
moring losing trade only moved from mid channel and CCI signal wasn't
on. Lesson here is that <span style="font-weight:bold;">if there are
more than one BUY/SELL signal on, then the move would have higher
probability and would be bigger too</span>.</p>
<p>There's still a lot for me to learn.</p>
