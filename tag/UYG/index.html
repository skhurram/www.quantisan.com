<p>I sold my 100 shares of UYG because it was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/">bought on margin last
Friday</a> when the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/">call option was exercised</a>. The effective share
price I bought was \$3.55. I sold it for \$4.49 today. A profit of \$94
- (\$7.5[option fee]+\$15[exercise fee]+\$5[stock fee]) commission.
Clearly, the commission made this trade a bad one. I didn't know TOS
charge me \$15 for exercising options.</p>
<p>I sold at \$4.50 because it's a resistance level and we tested it a
couple times this morning without breaking it. Although the risk/reward
at \$4.50 still remains favourable, I sold because I don't want to use
margin money. As of this writing, UYG has broken \$4.50 to \$4.67. I
believe \$5.00 is a good target and possible \$5.7 in the near term.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I still have my trump card in the financials. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">C options
strangle</a> is doing quite well now that the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122753629931853007.html">government is pumping
money into Citigroup</a>.</p>
<p>Update: After writing a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/">big piece on trailing stop</a> yesterday, I totally forgot to apply it myself. I really
should have used a trailing stop in this case since I thought \$4.40 was
a good stop. UYG is now trading at \$4.85 without much drawdown. At
least this is a small position.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been trying to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/?s=bottom">catch falling knives</a> for a few weeks now.
Every time I think we're at a bottom, the market rally a bit to get my
hopes up and then continue to drift down more. In retrospect, there are
so many trading no-no's I have broken with that dangerous mentality. My
account is down significantly as of this writing and I have learned many
old and new lessons throughout these weeks. In fact, I have demonstrated
improving trading <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">technique</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1190/">psychology</a> even as I was losing
money overall (what an oxymoron). Rather I'm trying to comfort myself or
not, the fact is that losing money is simply unacceptable in trading. So
I will review these trades in this post and perhaps learn something from
them.</p>
<p>As the title suggest, this is a post for post-hoc analysis of the
options which I held into expiry (3 losing and 1 winning). I'll do this
chronologically. The longest Nov09 position I have is SLW Nov 2.5 Call.
I have been a big fan of SLW as I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written and traded SLW numerous
times</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, I've annoted my charts
more than usual and will show more and write less in this post. I noted
my entry point in each trade, and labelled the stop and post-hoc <strong>ideal
exit/stop points</strong>.</p>

<p>My effective <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">entry point in my SLW Nov 2.5 Calls</a> were at SLW share
price of \$2.90 (SLW closed at \$2.81 Friday). I bought 2 Calls for
\$0.55 and at expiry, they are worth \$0.325. A loss of \$45 + \$15 for
commission as of this writing. I held on to my 2.5 calls and exercised
them, so +200 shares of SLW for me.</p>
<p>Next up is ABB on the same day. The share price for ABB was at \$10.31
when I entered. ABB closed Friday at \$9.95. I bougt the three ABB Nov
10 Calls for \$0.90. They are worth \$0.05 each. A total loss of \$255 +
\$15 for commission.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_858" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>Then we have TCK entered at TCK share price of \$5.575. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-tck-100-nov-08-5-call-100/">bought two
TCK Nov 5 Calls for \$1.00</a> each and they are now worthless. A
complete wipeout of \$200 + \$15 commission.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_860" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>Lastly, there's this puny winning day trade in the last 40 minute of
Friday. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/">bought a UYG Nov 3 Call for \$0.55</a> and it expired for
\$0.95. A profit of \$40 - \$15 comission, so a total of +\$25 so far. I
held on to this call and exercised it. I have +100 shares of UYG to
carry over the weekend.</p>

<p>As you can see, <strong>if only I have used trailing stops, I could have held
onto some of the profits and not turn winning trades into a losing
ones</strong>. I didn't want to let the large swing in premiums stop me out
from a big rally. That's why I didn't use trailing stop. However, the
lack of subsequent follow-through and confirmation in the rally should
have been a glaring alarm sign. I should have put in trailing stops from
this lack of strength in the rally. <strong>Any counter-trend position should
be carefully managed with tighter than usual risk management</strong>.</p>
<p>I have let my <em>undying hope for a rally</em> clouded my judgement. This
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/move-from-certainty-to-curiosity-to-improve-your-trading/">stubborn need to be right</a> is a very fundamental psychological flaw
in trading. If I can't stop doing that in the future, I might as well
quit trading manually and focus on developing my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative financial
engineering</a> work. However, as I have noted, I think I'm improving
lately and upon further reflection, I believe I have come up with a
potential methodology to correct myself in the act ... More on this as I
develop on this technique.</p>

<p>Just a cheap shot in the final 45 minutes of this option expiration
Friday. S&amp;P has shot up to 775 and retraced a little. The
Advance-Decline line has turned up and the TICK is strong during this
retracement. This looks like a strong setup to rally into the close.
Let's see if the market can do it. Otherwise, there goes \$62.50 into
the drain.</p>
