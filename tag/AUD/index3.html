            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-audjpy-81-22-sl-80-99-tp-82-50/">AUD/JPY long from yesterday</a> got stopped out after I moved the
exit stop to a breakeven price. Then I gave it another try once AUD/JPY
had a quick dip and recovered to 81.30 level around Tokyo noon. That has
been a time of large moves recently. My entries and exits are shown on
the 3-hour chart of AUD/JPY in Figure 1. The problem with this entry is
that the downside momentum is stronger than I thought. While being wrong
is perfectly fine in trading, I need to put more thoughts in short-term
analysis to improve my probability. In addition to the analysis which
I've done as previously discussed for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-audjpy-81-22-sl-80-99-tp-82-50/">my entry</a>, I am going to take into account yet another shorter
timeframe for my trade timing. Figure 2 shows a 30-minute chart of
AUD/JPY. Referring to Figure 2, the two blue triangles are my entries.
The two red dots are my exits from stops. In hindsight, my first entry
was about an hour early. Short-term resistance was obvious at 81.60 but
there is no short-term support shown. I should have entered either above
the resistance or when we failed to break 81.10 support the second time.
For the next few hours from 12:00 to midnight, AUD/JPY is testing that
long term resistance fChannel as shown in Figure 2. We can see that the
trendline is imposing a strong resistance on the pair as it hasn't been
able to hold more than a few bars above it. The second entry at 81.60 is
acceptable. AUD/JPY tested 81.30 again but managed to jump right back
up. Particularly if we look at the 3-hour chart of Figure 1, it would
seem that this is merely a short-term retracement from the 82.00
resistance. A stop at 81.30 as I have done has limited risk and it would
mark the line in the sand. If I'm to try going long this pair again with
this setup, I would use a half sized position only as the setup has
failed me twice already. But as can be seen in Figure 2, AUD/JPY is
failing 81.30 this morning again. This is an obvious sign of weakness in
the pair. So that's it for me for now to go long in this pair. A more
detailed log of my trades can be found on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log page</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Several major pairs are testing their support on this market correction
with a 20 points drop in the S&amp;P500 before 10 am. This is a short term
capitulation scenario. From looking at the major pairs, the long term
trend still seem to be intact. In particular, I am interested in
shorting Yen because I'm seeing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC setups</a> across the board in JPY
crosses. I compared AUD/JPY, CAD/JPY, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, and USD/JPY
pairs to decide which one to go long with. Seeing that I already have a
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-0122-sl-1-0060-tp-1-0225/">USD/CHF long position</a>, USD/JPY is out. Then EUR/JPY is out too
because of recent Euro weakness from my observations of intraday price
actions. I haven't had much luck with British Pounds, so GBP/JPY is out
too. That leaves me with my two favourites, CAD/JPY and AUD/JPY. So I
checked with USD/CAD and AUD/USD charts to see which has better
support/resistance. USD/CAD has a lot of resistance above 1.06, so going
with CAD/JPY long seem like to be less risky. However, from looking at
the 3-hour chart, I changed my mind to go with AUD/JPY long because it
is showing a positive divergence there. From the daily chart of AUD/JPY
shown in Figure 1, we can see that the up-trend is losing steam. The
price action is expected to be choppy. Long term condition, up and
choppy. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"

3-hour chart of AUD/JPY, this is where things get more clear. Notice
that AUD/JPY is testing the lower fChannel the third time in a month
with the lowest RSI. This is a clear positive divergence. [caption id=""

down move is making this long entry very dangerous. Thus, I am using the
NYSE intraday sentiment (Fig. 3) to pin point my entry. Notice the
extreme negative open and then the intraday positive divergence as shown
by the S&amp;P500 and TICK. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500"

compared the current scenario with earlier this month. Figure 4 is the
hourly chart of AUD/JPY when I entered this trade. Figure 5 is the
hourly chart of AUD/JPY from Nov 1st - 4th, when AUD/JPY last tested the
lower fChannel. I noticed that AUD/JPY had a tendency to break below my
fChannel by about 50 pips before reversing. With the fChannel at 81.80
today, AUD/JPY should fall to 81.30. I watched that level closely this
morning and timed my entry with the intraday sentiment as described
above. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUD/JPY,

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>A profitable trade is definitely a good thing. But when you sit idly to
see good profits turn into great profits, and then doing nothing to lock
in some of that windfall, it is time to review your trading strategy.
That is exactly what I have done last night when I saw my AUD/JPY shorts
took a 150 pips dive at the Sydney open to pass a strong support. And it
wasn't AUD/JPY only, all my 4 other pairs also pushed about 100 pips
deeper into the green to test their respective supports. But as quickly
as those unrealized profits appeared, it was quicker that they
evaporated. While I had <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">5 positions</a> last night and they all fit this
scenario, I will use my AUD/JPY short for this particular case study as
it was the most dramatic and easy to read. Here is a brief summary of my
AUD/JPY shorts. Figure 1 is a 3-hour chart of AUD/JPY showing my entries
and exits. I entered twice on Oct 29 (83.76 and 82.47, marked by yellow
triangles) and was stopped out with profits on Oct 31 and Nov 2 (81.7
and 81, marked by red dots). The trades ended up +147 and +206 pips with
1/2 the position size each. As shown in Figure 1, I did manage to
capture most of the down move nonetheless. So these weren't badly
executed at all. (I used my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">FTCS 0.1</a> as the trading setup, so I
won't go into the logic behind my entries and exits here.) What I'd like
to point out though is the long tail candlestick poking through the
support at 80.0. From Figure 2 daily chart, it is apparent that 80.0 for
AUD/JPY is a strong support from prior congestions. Not to mention that
it's a nice whole number. As such, it was naive of me to think that
AUD/JPY could break and maintain this depressed level on thin volume on
a Sunday (EST) Sydney open. Secondly, also note that in Figure 2, the
fall in price of AUD/JPY is quite extended as shown by the RSI's dive
from 90+ to about 40. Even if the pair is poised for further weakness,
there's bound to be some catch of breath before it can take on a strong
support. From the above 2 observations, which I did see at the time,
it's evident that I should have taken some profits (i.e. half of my
positions) when I had the chance. I knew in my mind that 80.0 was hard
to break, but instead of exiting on target, I merely tightened my stops
in hoping for more gains. Don't get me wrong. Using stops for entries
and exits have served me well and it will still remain my primary trade
order method. But if I'm to improve, to go from +200 pips to +300 pips
in a trade, I need to be able to spot and exploit other tools at my
disposal when extraordinary occasions such as last night's appear. So
what can I do in the future to prevent this from happening again? With 2
simple additions to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading strategy</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a profit target and take some chips off when the market reaches
    target at extreme conditions.</li>
<li>Keep these profit targets up-to-date according to the trading setup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that this is analogous to what I have already been doing with my
stops by moving them closeras the price action dictates. However, <strong>one
important caveat</strong> to this technique is that this should never override
the fundamental trading rule of letting profits run. I will only take
profits at a target if the price is severely over-extended according to
my trading setup. In any case, as [Ancient_Warrior][] wrote to me on
<a href="http://twitter.com/Quantisan">Twitter</a>, "<span><span>Well don't 'kick yourself' too much for 200
pip gains please! lol"</span></span></p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I shorted AUD/JPY on the 20th and then shorted EUR/JPY on the 21st. Both
positions were stopped out before Tokyo opened tonight. I didn't write
an opening post for EUR/JPY because it's the same as usual, long term
setup, short term timing. I'll briefly go over the two trades here and
what I have learned in hindsight. First let's talk about the AUD/JPY
trade. I wrote about the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-50-83-60-stop-85-50/">entry here</a>. Figure 1 shows the daily chart.
AUD/JPY has managed to edge out of its channel with an obvious negative
divergence on the RSI. However, it feels as though it's going to turn
any time soon as seen in Fig. 2. I'm not going to try again though
because I need to learn to trade what I see and what I feel. I shouldn't
even consider to short it until its below the short term channel. For
this AUD/JPY short entry, I entered too early because I drew my channel
too tight. If you compare Fig. 2 in this post with Fig. 2 from the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-50-83-60-stop-85-50/">entry post</a>, you'll see that the supporting line is lower
here. The previous line didn't enclose everything as it should. For my
EUR/JPY trade, I tried to short the top again.... <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">When will I learn</a>?
Fig. 3 shows the setup on the daily. EUR/JPY is obviously testing a
strong resistance. So far so good. Fig. 4 shows the 3-hour chart for my
entry (yellow inverted triangle to the right, the last red dot is the
exit). This is where I failed. EUR/JPY was testing 137 and the top of
the channel before I entered. Then once I saw that EUR/JPY failed to
touch 137 again for a few bars, I entered. Shorting a new top is
ill-advised because the price can consolidate upward along with the
channel as shown in Fig. 4. You'll be fighting a losing battle as the
momentum is working against you. In any case, the lesson from both of
these trades is that I need to learn to be more patient with my entry.
The loss for AUD/JPY is -130 pips for -\$29.82 and the loss for EUR/JPY
is -77 pips for -\$26.46. At least my position size was halved because I
knew these are risky trades. Note: All the charts were taken just now
after the exit. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"
