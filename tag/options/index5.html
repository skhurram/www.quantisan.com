            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Warning: Top/bottom picking is a dangerous art. I don't intend to trade
on this information myself. I did this out of pure curiosity. The
Canadian banks are an interesting phenomenon. Are they just hiding dirt
under the rug or are they really as good as our government say? Mish
Global Economic Trend Analysis posted a bearish view on <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2010/03/california-usa-vs-ontario-canada-which_29.html">California v.
Ontario</a>. Furthermore, The Baseline Scenario discussed [why the
strength of our banks is an illusion created by our government][]. As
such, on both a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/td-bank-making-headlines-with-a-new-all-time-high/">technical</a> and fundamental viewpoint, share prices of
our financial sector is way overbought. Of which, CIBC (CM.TO) seem
particularly screwed as its stock price hasn't been able to join in the
unreal rally of late. That sentiment seem to be confirmed with an
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/using-option-pain-max-pain-to-estimate-stock-price/">option pain valuation</a> as I described before. Max pain for CM.TO for
April expiration is pegged at \$72. Not surprisingly, \$72 marks a long
term support as shown in Figure 2 (blue line). A break below \$72 could
summon \$65. The data also show that there is a large open interest for
put options at the \$72 strike. Are they sold as covered puts or
something else? That I cannot tell. However, \$72 will definitely be an
important level for CM.TO in the near future. Nevertheless, as the
options market is small in Canada, I wouldn't put much weight on options
valuation for Canadian stocks. The value of open interest options on
April CM.TO is merely about the size of a single day's of equity traded.
P.S. March's max pain was \$68 one week prior to expiration. But CM.TO
closed above \$75 on March expiration. That wasn't even close.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Brunswick Corp. (BC) stayed above \$11.00 as we began the week. I placed
a stop at Friday's high before the open today to be executed at 10:30am.
When I got back at lunch, I found that my stop was triggered as soon as
it was sent. Luckily, it was also at the time when BC retraced the
open's gain slightly. So it was a good price to be out since BC has
closed above \$12 today (Figure 1). This trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-bc-100-oct-09-12-5-put-1-95-mark-10-81/">entered last Friday
before noon at 1.95</a>, when BC was trading at 10.81. This represents a
loss of \$65. For this particular trade, I adhered to my exit strategy
(even though it was a loss), so that's good. For the entry, I could have
waited later on in the day on Friday to see how the market performs as
we approached the end of the week. If I had done that, the reward/risk
would have been better. But I think I would have entered short anyway
since the sign were pointing downward when BC hung back to around \$11
at the close after breaking above \$11.20 intraday on good volume. And
the fact hat the market was consolidating too. Looking at the long term,
BC has retraced all its loss since the dive last year. For the market,
S&amp;P500 has etched higher today too but is still about 10 points below
last week's all-year high. The volume for the overall market is
noticeably lighter too. So this uptrend can possibly continue up as not
many is riding this move. We shall see how this goes. As can be seen
from Figure 2, BC at \$12 has some resistance above to \$13. For the
lower end of the range, we have \$9.60. A break below \$9.60 would
signal a stop of this recent bull train's momentum.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Here's one last try in shorting Brunswick Corp. <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Brunswick_(BC)">BC</a> gapped open about
50 cents this morning on an analyst upgrade. It subsequently tested
\$11.00 with about 5 times first 30-minute volume. It has since been in
a trading range. Why is this significant? Observing Figure 1, we can see
that \$10.85 is the 62% Fibonacci level of the entire drop from Sept 19,
2008. Practically exactly a year ago. Secondly, this huge volume at open
is good as it typically signal retail/pubic euphoria. Combining the two,
huge volume retail push + test a long term resistance = shorting
opportunity! In the near term, BC is also testing a resitance as shown
in Figure 2. Finally the stars may be aligned for a short in BC. I have
tried many times and failed miserably in the past several weeks. But
after analysing my trades and re-evaluating my method, this setup offers
a very good chance. So let's see how it goes. Entry: \$10.81 Stop:
\$11.00 by end of next week. Target: \$9.00, the next Fibonacci level.
Reward / Risk = \$155 / \$45 = 3.4. (These values are obtained by
estimating the premium of this option at expiry using the
Bjerksund-Stensland approximation.)</p>
