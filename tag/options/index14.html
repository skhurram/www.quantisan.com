            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>S&amp;P is up 50+ points today. We gapped up at the open, stayed in a
trading range for the day, then slowly rose up in the last hour, but
only to lose a small chunk and settled at 850, again. The volume has
been low throughout the day and the internals didn't look too good.
That's what prompted me to unload about half my positions in the last 45
minutes. The recent beating in my account certainly is making me being
very cautious now. I'd rather <strong>save my ammo to enter higher later when
we get confirmation for a rally than wait for one with bloated bullish
positions</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at the S&amp;P 500, TICK, and Advance-Decline line. Aside from the
open gap up peak, both the TICK and A-D line failed to impress
throughout the day. Actually, it was lack of strength in the numerous
840 tests and the weak 850 breakout about 3:20 that worried me. Notice
the lower lows in both the TICK and A-D line at the 840 and 850
breakouts in the chart below.</p>

<p>The first to go was -90 DELL @ 9.90 at 3:25pm for about a 50% loss. I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-90-dell-1649/">bought DELL at the beginning of October for \$16.49</a> and it has been
underperforming throughout the two months. There's been little volume
since I bought, up or down. Even with the exuberant buying on the market
today, DELL failed to break above \$10 (it did close at \$10.14). Most
important reason for me selling this long term holding now is that
there's very little volume even on this up day when everyone's expecting
a real bear rally.</p>

<p>Next up, I sold my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">C calls from the strangle placed Friday</a>. As I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-uyg-449/">said earlier in the day</a>, the news that the FED is bailing out
Citigroup has rocketed its share price from \$3.17 at my time of
purchase to \$6.50 on the morning rush. However, C share price eased
down throughout the day and failed to break \$6 with high volume. I sold
at about \$6.05. I purchased the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">+2 Dec 5 calls for \$0.79</a> and sold them for \$1.77. This was a
speculative play and I didn't want to be greedy. So I sold when C share
price showed it's lacking steam to continue to move up ahead.</p>

<p>Lastly, I sold my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-abb-100-dec-08-10-call-155/">+2 ABB Dec 10 calls purchased at \$1.55</a> for
\$1.70. A breakeven trade after commission. The drawdown was humongous
in this trade since I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/">missed some previous stops</a>. The ABB share
price action is a lot like DELL today, a lot of fireworks but no real
substance. Yes, the price is up a lot today, but there's no volume from
it. In particular, in the last 15 minute, ABB dived back down to its
major pivot point of \$11.10. I quickly unloaded my calls then.</p>

<p>Like everyone else, I am really hoping for a good bear rally. It would
do everyone, both bears and bulls, some good at this point. The thinking
is, after so many fake rallies lately, this one has to be it, right?
However, having learned my lesson in bottom picking in this bear market,
I'm putting my hope/logic aside and interpret what I see in front of me.
From today's price and volume movement, this rally doesn't seem like it
will follow through.</p>
<p>I do hope I'm wrong though, if we can hold the 845/840 level on the
S&amp;P500 tomorrow. Then I would be looking to add to my already 60% long
holdings.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been trying to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/?s=bottom">catch falling knives</a> for a few weeks now.
Every time I think we're at a bottom, the market rally a bit to get my
hopes up and then continue to drift down more. In retrospect, there are
so many trading no-no's I have broken with that dangerous mentality. My
account is down significantly as of this writing and I have learned many
old and new lessons throughout these weeks. In fact, I have demonstrated
improving trading <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">technique</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1190/">psychology</a> even as I was losing
money overall (what an oxymoron). Rather I'm trying to comfort myself or
not, the fact is that losing money is simply unacceptable in trading. So
I will review these trades in this post and perhaps learn something from
them.</p>
<p>As the title suggest, this is a post for post-hoc analysis of the
options which I held into expiry (3 losing and 1 winning). I'll do this
chronologically. The longest Nov09 position I have is SLW Nov 2.5 Call.
I have been a big fan of SLW as I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written and traded SLW numerous
times</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, I've annoted my charts
more than usual and will show more and write less in this post. I noted
my entry point in each trade, and labelled the stop and post-hoc <strong>ideal
exit/stop points</strong>.</p>

<p>My effective <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">entry point in my SLW Nov 2.5 Calls</a> were at SLW share
price of \$2.90 (SLW closed at \$2.81 Friday). I bought 2 Calls for
\$0.55 and at expiry, they are worth \$0.325. A loss of \$45 + \$15 for
commission as of this writing. I held on to my 2.5 calls and exercised
them, so +200 shares of SLW for me.</p>
<p>Next up is ABB on the same day. The share price for ABB was at \$10.31
when I entered. ABB closed Friday at \$9.95. I bougt the three ABB Nov
10 Calls for \$0.90. They are worth \$0.05 each. A total loss of \$255 +
\$15 for commission.</p>

<p>Then we have TCK entered at TCK share price of \$5.575. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-tck-100-nov-08-5-call-100/">bought two
TCK Nov 5 Calls for \$1.00</a> each and they are now worthless. A
complete wipeout of \$200 + \$15 commission.</p>

<p>Lastly, there's this puny winning day trade in the last 40 minute of
Friday. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/">bought a UYG Nov 3 Call for \$0.55</a> and it expired for
\$0.95. A profit of \$40 - \$15 comission, so a total of +\$25 so far. I
held on to this call and exercised it. I have +100 shares of UYG to
carry over the weekend.</p>

<p>As you can see, <strong>if only I have used trailing stops, I could have held
onto some of the profits and not turn winning trades into a losing
ones</strong>. I didn't want to let the large swing in premiums stop me out
from a big rally. That's why I didn't use trailing stop. However, the
lack of subsequent follow-through and confirmation in the rally should
have been a glaring alarm sign. I should have put in trailing stops from
this lack of strength in the rally. <strong>Any counter-trend position should
be carefully managed with tighter than usual risk management</strong>.</p>
<p>I have let my <em>undying hope for a rally</em> clouded my judgement. This
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/move-from-certainty-to-curiosity-to-improve-your-trading/">stubborn need to be right</a> is a very fundamental psychological flaw
in trading. If I can't stop doing that in the future, I might as well
quit trading manually and focus on developing my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative financial
engineering</a> work. However, as I have noted, I think I'm improving
lately and upon further reflection, I believe I have come up with a
potential methodology to correct myself in the act ... More on this as I
develop on this technique.</p>

<p>Just a cheap shot in the final 45 minutes of this option expiration
Friday. S&amp;P has shot up to 775 and retraced a little. The
Advance-Decline line has turned up and the TICK is strong during this
retracement. This looks like a strong setup to rally into the close.
Let's see if the market can do it. Otherwise, there goes \$62.50 into
the drain.</p>

<p>Citigroup is all over the news today. NYT:<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/business/21finance.html?ref=business">Citigroup Tries to Stop the
Drop in Its Share Price</a> and FT:<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c5cd6378-b7fe-11dd-ac6d-0000779fd18c.html">Citi board locked in talks as shares
dive</a>.</p>
<p>After failing to retake \$10 earlier in the week, C share price has gone
vertical. Since Citigroup is in-play in the market this week, this is a
great time to buy an options <a href="http://www.theoptionsguide.com/long-strangle.aspx">strangle</a> to capitalize on this
volatility. The bet here is that Citigroup would go down in flames or it
would rise back from the dead. This position will breakeven if C goes
below \$0.88 or above \$6.62. Given that C was at \$10 just days ago,
moving from \$3.44 as of now to beyond either of those range seems
viable.</p>
<p>Upside: Lots of talk about C at the moment. The stock is in-play. High
volatility is what the options strangle feed off by.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$5, we could bounce around the \$5 range</p>
<p>Downside: High volatility so options premium is expensive. The
volatility might be factored in the price already, so this \$0.88 to
\$6.62 range could be a trading range for C until expiry next month.</p>
<p>Support: errr... \$0?</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is a hedged play. I can profit if C goes up or down.
Given the extent of the situation with Citigroup, I think it's highly
likely we would break this range.</p>
