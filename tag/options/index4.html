            <div class="article-content"> <p>Here's one last try in shorting Brunswick Corp. <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Brunswick_(BC)">BC</a> gapped open about
50 cents this morning on an analyst upgrade. It subsequently tested
\$11.00 with about 5 times first 30-minute volume. It has since been in
a trading range. Why is this significant? Observing Figure 1, we can see
that \$10.85 is the 62% Fibonacci level of the entire drop from Sept 19,
2008. Practically exactly a year ago. Secondly, this huge volume at open
is good as it typically signal retail/pubic euphoria. Combining the two,
huge volume retail push + test a long term resistance = shorting
opportunity! In the near term, BC is also testing a resitance as shown
in Figure 2. Finally the stars may be aligned for a short in BC. I have
tried many times and failed miserably in the past several weeks. But
after analysing my trades and re-evaluating my method, this setup offers
a very good chance. So let's see how it goes. Entry: \$10.81 Stop:
\$11.00 by end of next week. Target: \$9.00, the next Fibonacci level.
Reward / Risk = \$155 / \$45 = 3.4. (These values are obtained by
estimating the premium of this option at expiry using the
Bjerksund-Stensland approximation.)</p>

entered this at [\$0.39 back in mid-August][]. This position is worth
\$0 now. That is a total loss of \$585 + \$15 commission. Long story
short, here are some mistakes I made with this trade, in decreasing
order of significance:</p>

<li>Shorting when the trend is obviously up.</li>
<li>Not adhering to my stop.</li>
<li>Low liquidity asset.</li>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've finally managed to offload my COF puts. This position was entered
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-cof-100-sep-09-35-put-1-90-mark-35-89/">two weeks ago at 1.90</a>, mark 35.89. The <strong>total loss is \$60 +
\$15</strong>. This is yet another poor trade because I didn't exit when my
stop was hit. This has been happening way too often lately while I'm
trying to catch the top (another big mistake). While it might be
obvious, but it's now clear to me that playing with a limited capital is
detrimental to my trading psychology. The commission is too much in
comparison to my position size. So I was often inclined to hold when I
should have been nimble.</p>
<p>The market finally moved downward with a sizable move today. S&amp;P500
tanked 20 points in an hour this morning. However, on a second test of
the 1000 level, I noticed a divergence on the TICK and COF wasn't making
a low like the market. That's when I decided to unload this position as
we're at the bottom of the recent channel. In addition, the long term
support at \$35.45 (Figure 2, pink line) should be a tough nut to crack
in the short term.</p>
<p>My only position left is my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-15-bc-100-sep-09-7-5-put-39-mark-9-12/">puts in BC</a>. I am now going to tie my
hands away from my trading platform and step back to developing my
trade. On the other hand, my quantitative finance work has been
progressing nicely and I should be able to publish some useful updates
soon.</p>
<p>Update: COF closed at \$35.09 today. I was early again. It's pretty
clear by now that my strategy is flawed. The more reason why I need to
put my head down and really start thinking.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>My limit order was executed at the open today for Capital One Financial
(COF). I placed this yesterday at the close and totally forgot about
it...</p>
<p>While we are testing a long term resistance (Figure 1, pink trendline at
top of chart) at about \$36, there is no confirmation yet. The recent
bullish momentum could very well sweep COF along to break it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a look at S&amp;P normalized by US Dollar Index shows the
market is also pushing up against a significant resistance. I will make
another post about this after the close today as a market analysis.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the divergence in sentiment based on high yield stocks or junk
bonds v. market price is as obvious as ever. Although this has been the
case for a while now, so this perspective doesn't hold much weight
anymore. The market simply can be irrational beyond anyone's guess.</p>
<p>Entry: \$35.89</p>
<p>Stop: Above \$35.00, by next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Target: \$33, by next week.</p>
<p>I've updated my risk metric for options to incorporate the time
parameter. A more thorough analysis can be gleaned from Figure 3 with
the expected value of the options at 1, 2, and 3 weeks from now.</p>
<p>To be more precise, the Profit/Loss on August 28 is -\$41.5 if COF =
\$36, and +\$110.6 if COF = \$33.</p>
<p>So the Reward / Risk = \$110.6 / \$41.5 = 2.7 \&lt; 5. The R/R is
predictably horrible. That's why I'm setting a tight stop on this. We'll
see how today's push higher plays out and I'll probably ditch this
sooner to minimize my risk.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've finally liquidated my COF shorts. The bid/ask was 0.25/0.35 and I
placed a limit order at 0.30. It was executed immediately. This leads me
to believe we'll be heading much lower today because of the market's
eagerness to take my puts.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for dumping these puts. First, is that the August
expiry is this Friday. The time decay this week has been brutal. <strong>A new
rule for options trading is that close any long options before the last
8 days or so til expiry.</strong> From then, the time decay really accelerates.</p>
<p>Secondly, we gapped lower today at the market, but there is no follow
through to the weakness at all. In fact, the market is making a
logarithmic rise and holding above 985 on the S&amp;P by 10:30am. The TICK
has also crossed +800 multiple times; whereas the lowest we've got so
far in the TICK is -728.</p>
<p>With the support for COF at \$34.00, there is very little I have to gain
when the market overall is holding above 985 and seem to be going higher
as of now. So I've decided to dump this position.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-cof-100-aug-09-33-put-2-20-mark-32-10/">purchased these puts at 2.20 about two weeks ago</a>. Total loss.
\$380 + \$15 = \$395. This is yet another trade that got away from me. I
am now going to limit my trading until I can find my edge again.</p>
<p>One mistake I've been making is neglecting the market environment. For
one, we've been in a bull market until proven otherwise (probably not
anymore since last Friday). Second, the market has been very choppy and
trading in a range this month. These are factors that I need to consider
in my future trades.</p>

longs this week</a> before expiration. My opportunity came today when PG
broke \$52.50 twice but failed to hold it for long. The time decay is
eating the premium fast this week, so seeing that it's unlikely PG will
make a spike higher now, so I'm unloading my August calls for it.</p>
<p>I [bought these calls for \$0.60 last week][] to hedge my shorts. This
amounts to a loss of \$60 + \$15 = \$75.</p>
