            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I was saying this morning, I placed an order before going to work for
a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/general-electric-the-next-aig/">Apr09 11/10 strangle on General Electric</a> (GE). My limit was at
\$1.31 (total) but the morning mark started at \$1.37 and kept creeping
up. I waited until 10 am and GE slowly gained in price. It stayed above
\$11 shortly and so I checked the strangle price on the 12/11 instead.
It was about \$1.40 too. So I just changed my order from 11/10 to 12/11
and upped my limit to meet the mid spread.</p>
<p>The risk profile for 12/11 is definitely different than 11/10. 11/10
would have been a good neutral position because GE is obviously
congested around the \$10.xx range. The 12/11 range is more short-heavy
because GE was only around \$11.07 when I entered. It's at the top of a
trading range. However, I took it anyway because I'm actually leaning to
the short side, in case you haven't noticed...</p>
<p>As you can see from Figure 1, daily on left and weekly on right, \$10.5
is a major long term pivot point. We are testing it at the moment on
weak volumn. Figure 2 shows the hourly on left and daily on right. As I
was saying this morning, GE's rally in March looks weaker as compared to
S&amp;P 500. The 10d MA haven't even crossed the 40d MA yet. Add to that,
last time the indicators were at this almost overbought level was last
year in the \$15 range. You can see what happened to that afterward. GE
skidded down to \$6.</p>
<p>However, we have broken that long term downtrend, see Figure 3. And
we're forming a long flag. This is definitely a glaringly bullish sign.
After all, we can't keep using the same channel forever.</p>
<p>Rather long or short, the important point is that GE is at a major
junction right now. Although I'm favouring the short side, but from
observing the action of the market in the past few days, there's also a
good chance GE will get lifted along with the rest of the market soon.
That's why I've put on a strangle to take advantage of both the long and
the short prospects.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm out of my short put on ABB to lighten my long positions in my
portfolio. This position is definitely one of the higher risk because of
the leverage in options. I shorted these puts at \$1.20 two weeks ago.
This represent a profit of \$120 - \$15 for commission.</p>
<p>ABB tested the 40 day MA on pretty low volume. It is hanging around the
\$13 mark today. However, the market looks weak as we're testing the 850
resistance again on the S&amp;P500 as we speak. So I'm unloading this first
because if it breaks down, ABB could dive fast.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I went long ABB by shorting its February 12.5 Puts. ABB is holding its
12 support very well on this bloodbath day on the market.</p>
<p>I'm selling puts instead of buying the shares because I want to keep my
50% cash available for a potential rally soon.</p>

<p>Upside: Inverse head and shoulder forming. Positive divergence on
indicators at this neck level.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$14</p>
<p>Downside: Diminishing volume for past couple of months. 200 day MA still
down and 10 day MA just turned downward too.</p>
<p>Support: \$12</p>
<p>Bottom line: So many stocks and indices seem to be tittering at their
supports today. I even considered entering into FAS or UWM for a bounce
move. But I decided to be safe and placed my bet on strength and clearer
signs. Since I entered when ABB is trading at \$12.17 and my stop is
\$11.90 or so, I consider this to be a low risk trade for a potential
Obama rally next week.</p>
<p>Target: \$15</p>
<p>Stop: Just below \$12.</p> </div>

<p>It's interesting to see that my prediction as pretty accurate this
morning. We are in fact trading in the 845 - 870 level on the S&amp;P. After
having so many large swing days in the market, this is good that we're
taking a breather. And then get ready for some more big moves probably
after the US Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p>One stock that's been lackluster lately is TCK. It is clearly not a
stock in-play at the moment. This is a huge contrast to the times
earlier when lots of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-tck-100-nov-08-5-call-100/">bad news were hitting TCK</a> and the share price
tanked. While being out of sight likely, the price continued to drift
down to some new lows. Unlike many of the players in the market, there
just isn't much swing in TCK even though we've been moving like 50
points on the S&amp;P on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Upside: This record low price level and the lack of interest in the
stock. It has to move one way or the other some time. Even though I have
a bullish bias in TCK, I am using an options strangle to hedge my
position. Just in case.</p>
<p>Downside: We might be stuck inbetween my breakeven price of 1.97 and
5.53 until December. The exact premium paid was 0.27 for the 2.5 Put and
0.26 for the 5 Call.</p>
