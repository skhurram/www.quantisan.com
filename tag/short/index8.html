            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My long USD/CHF got stopped out just minutes ago.  The support at 1.0300
has broken.  The intermediate and short term trends are both down.  So I
have entered a short trade for USD/CHF with 1/2 position to see how it
goes.</p>
<p>I initially had set the stop at 1.0340 for this trade.  But the support
at 1.0270 looks hard to break on first try.  So I readjusted my target
and stop to aim for an exit at 1.0270.  In fact, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve
placed an order to reverse and go long at 1.027 with a full position.</p>
<p>Entry: 1.0296, just below round number.</p>
<p>Stop: 1.0340, trailing, set at the previous congestion zone.</p>
<p>Target: 1.0270, previous support level.</p>
<p>Reward / Risk = 26 / 19 = 1.4 \&lt; 3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ this is horrible.  So
I just closed my trade at a slight loss at 1.03013 for -\$1.56.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My NZD/USD short at 0.72509 just before noon today got stopped out an
hour later at 0.72661. At least it was only a 1/2 position. I wanted to
short again when NZD/USD broke 0.7280 because of the resistance as shown
in Figure 1. However, remembering #1 in my newly updated <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">3 trading
rules</a>, I re-considered and held back. NZD/USD is testing 0.7300 at
this moment, so this rule is proving itself useful already. What's
interesting now is that as NZD/USD is testing 0.7300, both USD/CAD and
USD/CHF are well off the support levels of 1.0700 and 1.0300,
respectively. There's no particular reason for using these two pairs,
they are just two pairs that I've been following. Which seems to me that
the weakness is USD isn't as bad as it would seem. If it is, then US
dollar would be under pressure in all fronts. And it's not now. At least
not yet. Thus, not giving up on this nice setup as shown in Figure 1,
I've placed a short stop entry for 50% position just below the next
intraday support at 0.7262. Just to catch it on its way down from this
very obvious resistance level. In any case, here're my 5 reasons for
shorting based on Figure 1.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend is neutral</li>
<li>We're at the top of a trading range</li>
<li>Near resistance at long term Fib level and round number at 0.7300</li>
<li>Potential double top, although this is very uncertain</li>
<li>Little breathing room in recent climb up</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, here is my order: Size: Half position, 3000 units Side:
Short Stop entry: 0.7262 Stop exit: 0.7300, set to trail Target: 0.7132,
top of that uptrending line in Figure 1 Reward / Risk = 130 / 38 = 3.42
> 3 I'm pondering should I enter 50% position when NZD/USD is hanging
around 07290. But I think I'll hold it off since my USD/CHF is still
open. Update: My short entry was triggered for 0.72509 (horrible
spread). I was stopped out at 0.72661 an hour later for a net loss of
\$4.57. This was not a good trade because NZD/USD was so close to a
round number resistance that it was probable to test it.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Here's one last try in shorting Brunswick Corp. <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Brunswick_(BC)">BC</a> gapped open about
50 cents this morning on an analyst upgrade. It subsequently tested
\$11.00 with about 5 times first 30-minute volume. It has since been in
a trading range. Why is this significant? Observing Figure 1, we can see
that \$10.85 is the 62% Fibonacci level of the entire drop from Sept 19,
2008. Practically exactly a year ago. Secondly, this huge volume at open
is good as it typically signal retail/pubic euphoria. Combining the two,
huge volume retail push + test a long term resistance = shorting
opportunity! In the near term, BC is also testing a resitance as shown
in Figure 2. Finally the stars may be aligned for a short in BC. I have
tried many times and failed miserably in the past several weeks. But
after analysing my trades and re-evaluating my method, this setup offers
a very good chance. So let's see how it goes. Entry: \$10.81 Stop:
\$11.00 by end of next week. Target: \$9.00, the next Fibonacci level.
Reward / Risk = \$155 / \$45 = 3.4. (These values are obtained by
estimating the premium of this option at expiry using the
Bjerksund-Stensland approximation.)</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've finally managed to offload my COF puts. This position was entered
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-cof-100-sep-09-35-put-1-90-mark-35-89/">two weeks ago at 1.90</a>, mark 35.89. The <strong>total loss is \$60 +
\$15</strong>. This is yet another poor trade because I didn't exit when my
stop was hit. This has been happening way too often lately while I'm
trying to catch the top (another big mistake). While it might be
obvious, but it's now clear to me that playing with a limited capital is
detrimental to my trading psychology. The commission is too much in
comparison to my position size. So I was often inclined to hold when I
should have been nimble.</p>
<p>The market finally moved downward with a sizable move today. S&amp;P500
tanked 20 points in an hour this morning. However, on a second test of
the 1000 level, I noticed a divergence on the TICK and COF wasn't making
a low like the market. That's when I decided to unload this position as
we're at the bottom of the recent channel. In addition, the long term
support at \$35.45 (Figure 2, pink line) should be a tough nut to crack
in the short term.</p>
<p>My only position left is my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-15-bc-100-sep-09-7-5-put-39-mark-9-12/">puts in BC</a>. I am now going to tie my
hands away from my trading platform and step back to developing my
trade. On the other hand, my quantitative finance work has been
progressing nicely and I should be able to publish some useful updates
soon.</p>
<p>Update: COF closed at \$35.09 today. I was early again. It's pretty
clear by now that my strategy is flawed. The more reason why I need to
put my head down and really start thinking.</p>
