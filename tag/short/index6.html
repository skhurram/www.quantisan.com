            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>A profitable trade is definitely a good thing. But when you sit idly to
see good profits turn into great profits, and then doing nothing to lock
in some of that windfall, it is time to review your trading strategy.
That is exactly what I have done last night when I saw my AUD/JPY shorts
took a 150 pips dive at the Sydney open to pass a strong support. And it
wasn't AUD/JPY only, all my 4 other pairs also pushed about 100 pips
deeper into the green to test their respective supports. But as quickly
as those unrealized profits appeared, it was quicker that they
evaporated. While I had <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">5 positions</a> last night and they all fit this
scenario, I will use my AUD/JPY short for this particular case study as
it was the most dramatic and easy to read. Here is a brief summary of my
AUD/JPY shorts. Figure 1 is a 3-hour chart of AUD/JPY showing my entries
and exits. I entered twice on Oct 29 (83.76 and 82.47, marked by yellow
triangles) and was stopped out with profits on Oct 31 and Nov 2 (81.7
and 81, marked by red dots). The trades ended up +147 and +206 pips with
1/2 the position size each. As shown in Figure 1, I did manage to
capture most of the down move nonetheless. So these weren't badly
executed at all. (I used my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">FTCS 0.1</a> as the trading setup, so I
won't go into the logic behind my entries and exits here.) What I'd like
to point out though is the long tail candlestick poking through the
support at 80.0. From Figure 2 daily chart, it is apparent that 80.0 for
AUD/JPY is a strong support from prior congestions. Not to mention that
it's a nice whole number. As such, it was naive of me to think that
AUD/JPY could break and maintain this depressed level on thin volume on
a Sunday (EST) Sydney open. Secondly, also note that in Figure 2, the
fall in price of AUD/JPY is quite extended as shown by the RSI's dive
from 90+ to about 40. Even if the pair is poised for further weakness,
there's bound to be some catch of breath before it can take on a strong
support. From the above 2 observations, which I did see at the time,
it's evident that I should have taken some profits (i.e. half of my
positions) when I had the chance. I knew in my mind that 80.0 was hard
to break, but instead of exiting on target, I merely tightened my stops
in hoping for more gains. Don't get me wrong. Using stops for entries
and exits have served me well and it will still remain my primary trade
order method. But if I'm to improve, to go from +200 pips to +300 pips
in a trade, I need to be able to spot and exploit other tools at my
disposal when extraordinary occasions such as last night's appear. So
what can I do in the future to prevent this from happening again? With 2
simple additions to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading strategy</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a profit target and take some chips off when the market reaches
    target at extreme conditions.</li>
<li>Keep these profit targets up-to-date according to the trading setup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that this is analogous to what I have already been doing with my
stops by moving them closeras the price action dictates. However, <strong>one
important caveat</strong> to this technique is that this should never override
the fundamental trading rule of letting profits run. I will only take
profits at a target if the price is severely over-extended according to
my trading setup. In any case, as [Ancient_Warrior][] wrote to me on
<a href="http://twitter.com/Quantisan">Twitter</a>, "<span><span>Well don't 'kick yourself' too much for 200
pip gains please! lol"</span></span></p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This was definitely one of my better executed trades recently. Here's my
logic for the entry and exit. As shown in Fig. 1, at the time of entry
(marked by the faint vertical line on 10/23), NZD/USD made a negative
divergence with a higher price and lower RSI. There has been a series of
false alarm on the RSI overbought entry signals. However, 0.76 is an
important resistance because it is where the massive downturn started in
July 2008. I timed my short entry based on Figure 2. We made a lower
high just below 0.76 and within the previous channel. Then I waited for
the current downtrend to break the ascending support line to place the
order. The order was subsequently filled on Sunday night during the
Asian open when I was sleeping. Frankly, I wasn't too happy at first
because my fill price was right at the low. I kept my position anyway
and allowed the stop to work for me. This is probably the best decision
I've made with this trade. By remaining patient, I didn't succuum to
micro-managing my position like I've done before. With regard to the
exit, I took profit at my target at the ascending support shown in
Figure 1. That support line worked well for half of the year in this
rapid ascend of NZD/USD. So I didn't want to risk a bounce by taking
profit at this point. However, NZD/USD has traded down to 0.7260 as I'm
writing this. Time will tell if the exit is a good one or that I should
have left half the position in. The net gain for this trade is \$79.82
because I mistakenly entered a full position instead of half as I
should. Here are the R/R that I saw when I entered this trade. Position
size: 100% Entry: 0.7520 Stop: 0.7600 Target: 0.7300 Reward / Risk = 220
/ 80 = 2.75 \&lt; 3. I thought I was entering with only a 50% position size
because of the R/R not meeting my criteria. However, I read my own
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">forex position sizer</a> wrong and gone in with a full position.
Luckily, things have worked out. But I have since updated my position
sizer so this won't happen again.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I started to doubt this move mere minutes after placing it, which rarely
happens. And not because of the price action. It was solely for my
reasoning for this trade. On a quick mental review of this entry, I
noticed that they sounded more like excuses than reasons. First sign of
it was that I laid in a 100% position to fade a strong trend on the
daily on the basis of my 3-hour chart. My strategy is to not risk more
than 50% (preferably 25% - 33%) to fade a trend on the daily. Lack of
discipline #1. Next, I already had six 50% positions open at the time.
That would roughly translate to 3% of my account, without even taking
into account the high correlations (working on a spreadsheet for this).
By adding this 7th position, I've broken my fundamental rule of risk
management to not risk more than 3% of the totals funds at any single
moment. Lastly, it was the end of the trading day on Friday. Carrying
trades over the weekend is well known be even more risky than usual
because so much could happen over the two days. To add a low probability
trade on a loaded to the neck account into the weekend is practically
suicidal. I'm just glad that I had a hard stop to limit my risk. At
least I did something right here. In terms of the dollar amount lost,
the loss for this trade is \$44.17 on paper. And after this stupid move,
I have given up all my +500 pips gain (also on paper) from the week
before. Much work remains to be done to improve my trading performance.
A last note to self from this what-not-to-do lesson. All trades should
be taken with logic and reasons. I failed to do that in this trade by
convincing myself that USD should reverse over the weekend. On top of
it, I took as big of a position as my system allows to gamble on this
intuition. These are two breaches of trading rules that could ruin an
account. It's good that I'm stopped out with a loss in this trade
because if this became profitable, it could boost my ego and this
problem would only get worse. Another silver lining in this is that I am
beginning to trade forex with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> instead of diving in
with real money first. In addition to testing my forex strategies (which
I haven't followed as diligently as I should), I'm learning much about
my weaknesses in trading in general by keeping a detailed journal and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">statistics of my trades</a>. Update: EUR/USD cratered to 1.4844 today.
Another shortcoming with an undisciplined trade is the opportunity cost.
If I weren't so preoccupied with the stop loss from this morning, I
would have followed my setup and shorted EUR/USD today as it went
spiraling down.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I placed this order to short AUD/JPY before going to bed last night. The
order was filled overnight. I have tweaked my strategy a little and this
is a first test. I think I need to start naming my strategies and giving
them version number. It will make it easier to keep track in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">my trading
log</a> and for quick comparisons. Here's what I saw to make me throw my
dice at this pair. Figure 1 is the daily and Figure 2 is the 3-hour
chart. My reasoning are as follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>AUD/JPY is testing the top of a channel, Fig. 1</li>
<li>Its RSI is pushing above 80, a level not seen since January when it
    was trading about 67.50.</li>
<li>USD/JPY tested 91 and headed downward.</li>
<li>AUD/USD heading up to the sky with a worsening divergence.</li>
<li>EUR/JPY (a recent <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-eurjpy-135-00-500-1-pips/">+500 pips trade</a>) failed to break 136 and
    showing an evident negative divergence too.</li>
<li>Short term testing of ascending support line, Fig. 2. (Should have
    given this more room though)</li>
</ol>
<p>Position size: 50%, another 50% waiting to enter below 82.90 Entry:
83.60 Stop: 85.50, see Fig. 1. Target: 77.50, bottom of channel, see
Fig. 1. Reward / Risk =610 / 190 = 3.2. The stop is a lot wider than my
previous trades because I'm finding it not worth my time to micro-manage
my trades. However, notice that my total position size is adjusted
accordingly to not risk more than 1% of my forex portfolio in a trade.
My focus is on the daily so it's only natural to give it more room as
I'm not a prophet and couldn't tell when a trade would work out. This is
one of the revision made to this strategy as learned from my recent
lessons. A trade is only as good as what you have learned from it.
Profit is only secondary.</p>
