            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I cannot believe that I am doing this. I am shorting my favourite asset,
gold. Spot gold was trading at 1372 at the time of my short during lunch
hour (see Fig. 1). I bought 350 shares of Horizons BetaPro Gold Bear
Plus ETF (HGD.TO) to short gold. It is just more convenient to do that
in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">RRSP trading account at Questrade</a>. I am well aware of the
deteriorating value of a leveraged ETF (especially bearish ones). So I
don't intend to hold this for more than a few days. The reason for this
trade is simple. Today Bernanke made it clear that QE2 is on (WSJ:
<a href="http://on.wsj.com/atEQ2z">Bernanke Makes Case for Further Fed Moves to Boost Economy</a>).
Coincidentally, note the orchestrated weakening upward momentum across
precious metal (Fig. 1), currency (Fig. 2), and equities (Fig. 3).
Perhaps this is a matter of buy the rumour and sell the news? I am
betting that this rocket is running out of fuel. If I am wrong, I have
my stop set with a limited risk. If I am right, there's a long way down
from up here. So this trade is merely a matter of exploiting good
risk/reward. Stop is set at HGD.TO \$9.90. Anything below \$10.20 will
be a sign of caution. Maximum risk is (\$10.26 - \$9.90) * 350 = \$126
+ \$9.90 commission = \$135.90 = 1.4% of account. [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>S&amp;P500 managed to bounce back from below 1130 support. It is confirmed
by EUR/USD's rise and treasury's gap down (TLT) today. I'm not going to
argue with the market. So I am ditching my short for Manulife Financial
(MFC.TO) while it is still testing its 13.00 resistance at the open.
12.60 is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level for MFC. It made a textbook
perfect bounce on it (Fig. 1). Also, it's Friday today, so I'd rather
not have the time decay eat more out of my premium by holding over the
weekend. Loss for this trade is (\$1.74 - <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-jan-2010-puts-14-00-1-70-mark-13-25/">\$1.70</a>) * 100 * 4 = \$16
- \$27.90 = -\$11.90 = -0.10%. Now that I am out of my short position,
watch the market tank without me on board. Update: MFC and the market
managed an impressive rally today. MFC closed at 13.15. I am glad that I
followed my own strategy. I guess I do make <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">good timing once in a blue
moon</a>. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am shorting again. This time on Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) with a
January 2011 put at 14 strike price. MFC is trading at \$13.25 at time
of entry. Recent series of <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-bank-story-no-one-is-talking-about-2010-09-10">prop desk closings</a> isn't going to bode
well for the market, particularly for the banks as they need to
recuperate those easy income. On top of it, the lack of push from the
bulls this week as S&amp;P test 1110 resistance doesn't look promising
either. Yet, this could very well be a bear trap. In any case, I am
taking a bearish bet via shorting MFC. Figure 1 shows a chart of MFC. It
is depressed and it is struggling. Moreover, MFC keeps announcing
billions of dollars worth of share offerings lately. I like it. There is
a distinct possibility of a bear raid if MFC can break this \$13.50
resistance level. The gap above \$15 is just staring at me. Hard stop is
at \$1.00 premium. Worst case risk for this trade is thus (\$1.70 -
\$1.00) * 4 * 100 = 280 + \$27.90 commission = \$307.90 = 3.2%.
However, I'd be very cautious if MFC closes above \$13.50. [caption

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is my first real forex trade after <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-holding-on-to-intermediate-term-support-at-1-0868/">a year minus one day of
studying the market</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a>. Shorted USDCAD based on
the following intermarket observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yesterday's equities sell-off held around S&amp;P at 1050</li>
<li>Overnight Asian market seem orderly, not every market followed
    through, but most did</li>
<li>European markets down move were slow overnight until US open</li>
<li>But perhaps most importantly, EUR/USD made a higher low with an
    increasing COT</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, as much as the sell-off tries to scare off people, the
markets don't seem to be moving in unison. So it would seem this move
(in equities, thus inverse USD) is still a bear trap in an intermediate
term bull rally. Plus this daily chart, Figure 1, for picking USDCAD
specifically. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

market by studying the loonie. Let's see how this first trade performs.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Finally a profitable trade in my USDCAD short after being stopped out a
few times. My decision last week to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-short-target-hit-1-0581-trying-something-new-to-hold-for-longer/">hold this for longer</a> after
USDCAD touched my target paid off. I moved my stop closer last Thursday
evening and the order got filled on Friday. However, as I type this on
the following Monday, USDCAD is trading even lower at 1.0478. It looks
as though my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">original target of 1.0415</a> is in the cards. Even though
this is a profitable trade with a 0.17% gain in my demo account, there
is one major flaw with this short USDCAD play. I was not able to squeeze
more out of this profitable move. As I've said, this short took a few
tries. In fact, if we consider all the entires and exits of this play.
My stopped out losses totaled 0.29% and my single win here is merely
0.17%. So I'm actually at a net loss of 0.12% from all these work. My
win/loss rate is about 40% based on my review of recent forex trades. I
was able to edge out more than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">10% profit in four months</a> because
when I am wrong, I take small steps. But when I'm right, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">pile into a
position</a>. Ever since my trading environment has changed, I've been
trying to trade a longer timeframe. This USDCAD short is my first
attempt on a new strategy. Evidently, I will need to re-think and
re-learn what I've become accustomed to in the past few months. One of
the necessary trait of a successful trader is to be able to adapt.
Markets change. Traders need to evolve with the markets or they will
become obsolete. This will be a good test of myself to see if I can
re-invent myself to adapt to a changing trading environment. [caption

moved my stop to breakeven last night. Normally, I would have covered
most, if not all, of the position at this point. But I'll hold onto the
full amount this time. For now. Reasons are as follow. <!--more--></p>
<ol>
<li>USDCAD likes to grind out both bulls and bears at obvious levels</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">down move that I'm seeing</a> is still in an early
    stage.</li>
<li>My position is too small to be worthwhile if I take profit now.</li>

    winners long enough.</li>
<li>I must learn to adopt a longer term strategy now that I [can't trade
    as often][].</li>

<p>In particular, Figure 1 shows what I mean by #2.</p>

to add to this position. As long as USDCAD stays below 1.0645, I'm
confident (not exactly the right word though) with this down move. From
this point onward, it's new territory for me as I push beyond my comfort
zone. Is this an ill-fated move or a spark of insight? Let me know what
you think about this extended trade. Update February 15: I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-usdcad-short-1-0540-for-131-pips/">closed this
