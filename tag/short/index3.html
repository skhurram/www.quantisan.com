            <div class="article-content"> <p>Perhaps third times' the charm? I tried to short USDCAD twice last week
already. Both times I've been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-out-of-usdcad-short-1-0640-for-67-pips-re-entering-1-0680/">stopped out</a> for a total of -0.2% of

before. So I won't repeat myself here. Entry signal for this particular
short is shown in Figure 1. I'm just using the 4-hour chart as I have a
well defined (recent top) stop this time. I compensate with a smaller
position size to limit my risk to 0.1%. Reward / Risk = (1.05761 -
1.0671) / (1.0671 - 1.0756) = 1.11 [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well this was awful. USDCAD continued on a rampage upward and I was
caught on the wrong side of the fence. Total loss for this was 0.12% of
my account. At least I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">was light in it</a>. In retrospect, I broke my
own rule and didn't enter at one of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">4 fundamental entry points</a>.
However, after some bear rampage throughout the markets today
(Bloomberg: [Stocks Plunge on Concern Rising Debt, Job Losses Threaten
Global Recovery][]), USDCAD is at the top of my channel as shown in
Figure 1 below. So while my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">previous entry</a>
was early. USDCAD at this price is a good short. I will take it slow
this time by setting a limit order below current support on the 4-hour
at 1.0680, with a stop at 1.0750. And then adding a second chunk at
1.0640, my stopped out price. As is customarily lately, I am only
risking 0.1% of my account on the initial order. On a weekly chart,
1.0750 to 1.0810 is obviously a strong resistance for the USDCAD. It is
a congestion zone in 2007 and 2008. Then USDCAD spent the last quarter
of 2009 trying to break this resistance to no avail. But who knows,
perhaps USDCAD has had enough and it will break this resistance
decisively soon. That's why I'm only betting on this reversal with
limited risk. It's just a matter of wait and see now.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Taking a first position in USD/CAD short here at 1.0573 on a 4-hour
moving averages cross-over (Figure 1). I've also placed a limit order to
add more at 1.0519 below Fibonacci support (shown in Figure 1). Reason
for this trade is that USD/CAD is moving away from an upper bound
channel with a overbought stochastic reading, as shown in the daily
chart of Figure 2. I've also considered going long AUD/USD, but AUD/CAD
trend remains bearish. So I chose to short USD/CAD instead. Secondly,
crude oil (and gold too) looks to be bouncing off an oversold level with
a rapid move in 2 days from 72.43 to 77.39. Coincidentally, INO.com
posted an intermediate term <a href="http://www.ino.com/info/513/CD4184/&amp;dp=0&amp;l=0&amp;campaignid=3">cyclical analysis video with a bullish
outlook</a> (affiliate link). They put out a better case than I do.
USD/CAD might make a short-term upward bounce here because of a
short-term oversold condition. However, there's evidently a lack of
buyers in the past few hours (Fig. 1). The price has been sitting on
support a bit too long in my view. Thus, I'm expecting it to break
without a meaningful retracement (hence the short entry). A confirmation
would be a break below 1.0530. Thus I have a limit order to short more
below that price. I am risking 0.1% of my account on this trade. As you
may have noticed, these charts are from Metatrader. I'm switching over
to the MT4 platform as of today. Having played with its charting
features for the past few hours, I'm quite satisfied with it so far.
Although my needs are low as I was fine with the Oanda platform too
(arguably the most simplistic platform out there). [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>GBP/JPY finally broke below an intermediate term wedge pattern formed
from Dec 30. See Figure 1 for the daily chart. I am noticeably late in
this GBP/JPY short entry because I was preoccupied with other positions
(e.g. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/closed-eurchf-and-gbpchf-shorts-best-trade-ever/">my EUR/CHF and GBPCHF shorts</a>) today. In any case, this is an
intermediate term (a few days at least) play so there is no rush. My
first short was executed at 146.51 on obvious signs of short term pound
weakness versus the GBP/CHF pairs. GBP/JPY made some retracement on a
test of 146.00 but GBP/CHF kept on dropping, so I took a short position
once it touched the 146.50 resistance. My average price in this is
146.32. I have set my stop loss to lock in some profits already (which
might get taken out soon). Note that I just happened to be watching the
GBP/CHF currency pair as I have a position on shorting that too.
Otherwise EUR/GBP and GBP/USD would have been better for short-term
intermarket analysis because of higher liquidity. With regard to this
formation, as you can see on Figure 1, today's break of 147.50 gave way,
all the way, down to 143.00. This target price is estimated from the
height of the wedge pattern which it just broke through. The distance
from 147.50 to 143.00 is about the distance of the height of the wedge
(Dec 29th low to 30th high). Another reason for targeting this 143.00
price is because of my weekly chart of Figure 2. 142.50-143.00 is the
next support according to a long term trendline (lowest ascending white
line) as shown in Figure 2. GBP/JPY haven't seen these prices for a good
month, so hopefully the move down shouldn't be too difficult. As usual,
I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">stockpile my short position</a> in this gradually to limit risk.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been stopped out of all my Aussie shorts on the breakout today. But
my setups for AUDUSD and AUDJPY are still intact as the resistances are
still safe. Having failed so many times in shorting AUDJPY (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">first
try</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-retrying-audjpy-short-84-52-stop-85/">second try</a>), I am taking a conservative approach on that
particular play. Although those setups are ripe for entries, I'll wait
til the test of resistances hold first before entering short again in
AUDJPY and AUDUSD. Which begs the question of, why AUDCAD, and why now?
First of all, I still have conviction about my Aussie short because of
the setups as <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">discussed previously</a> and the fact that gold
price is holding the 40 day ema at 1135 at the moment. That 40 day ema
has worked well on the uptrend in the past few months. So it should be
respected if gold is indeed in a downtrend now as I surmise. So why
short AUDCAD instead of the popular AUDUSD? Simply because AUDUSD broke
out of a short term range whereas AUDCAD is still holding as seen in the
AUDCAD 3-hour chart of Figure 1. This shows AUDCAD is weaker even when
gold is making new short term high.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUD/CAD,
3-hour"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_3h.PNG" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>For the big picture, see Figure 2 for the weekly chart of AUD/CAD. We
see that 0.98-0.99 has always been the turning point for a massive 1000+
pips selloff. We've hit 0.99 back in November and the slide is already
in progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see from Figure 2 that AUDCAD bounced off the 40 week ema
in late December and ran up to 0.95 from 0.92. 0.95 is a decidedly
important round number resistance as it was also a peak in April of
2007. You know, the time before the economy started to crack as shown
with the topping in the markets.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUDCAD,
weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD.png">1</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Now that I've established that the trend is pointing down. I still need
to time my short entry.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the daily chart of AUDCAD. In view of the above
discussion, we have a good chunk of resistance above 9550 as marked by
the purple box in Figure 3. This is the all important safety net for
this short entry. As long as AUDCAD stays below 9600, this long term
setup remains intact. And don't forget the broken uptrend line.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUDCAD,

<p>Lastly, notice the RSI trends in both the 3-hour (Fig. 1) and daily
charts (Fig 3.), they are both showing negative divergences. Figure 1 is
my timing for this entry, see the current negative RSI divergence marked
by the downward trend in RSI versus the toppy price.</p>
<p>In summary, here are my signals for this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC setup</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Weekly chart shows downward trend.</li>
<li>Big resistance above current price on daily.</li>
<li>Broken uptrend line on daily on retracement from weekly chart.</li>
<li>Intermarket relation with gold testing 40 day ema at 1135.</li>
<li>Negative RSI divergence on 3-hour chart.</li>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">previous AUDJPY short entry</a> was early as I surmised (entered
without short-term confirmation). I made a number of ins and outs with
that trade as depicted in Figure 1. Some were winners, some were losers.
In all, it's around breakeven in that trade. However, I have re-entered
this short in AUDJPY just now at 84.52 using <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">the same long term
setup</a> (see weekly chart in that post) as
it hasn't been broken yet. Moreover, AUDJPY is in the process of making
a negative divergence on the 3-hour chart as shown in Figure 1. The key
word is "in the process". There is still a possibility of a breakout
upward from here. I am being aggressive to establish a position here
because of intermarket divergence in Aussie crosses versus gold price
overnight. See Figure 2. As you can see, gold made a marginally higher
high above 1130 on the 4-hour chart of Figure 2. Yet, neither AUDUSD nor
AUDJPY followed suit. Those two currency pairs are holding their
respective double top. The exception is EURAUD, it keeps diving
downward, but that can be accounted for by Euro weakness. It would have
been a perfect picture of EURAUD can hold its bottom though. I wouldn't
count this trade to work out just yet. That's why I'm only risking 0.2%
of my account with a small <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">position size</a> for now. As you can see
from my trade orders shown in Figure 2. I have a couple limit orders
just below the near-term supports to add to this short. My pawns have
been placed. Let's wait and see what the market does.</p>
