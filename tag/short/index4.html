            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Perhaps third times' the charm? I tried to short USDCAD twice last week
already. Both times I've been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-out-of-usdcad-short-1-0640-for-67-pips-re-entering-1-0680/">stopped out</a> for a total of -0.2% of
account loss. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">intermediate term analysis</a> remains the same as
before. So I won't repeat myself here. Entry signal for this particular
short is shown in Figure 1. I'm just using the 4-hour chart as I have a
well defined (recent top) stop this time. I compensate with a smaller
position size to limit my risk to 0.1%. Reward / Risk = (1.05761 -
1.0671) / (1.0671 - 1.0756) = 1.11 [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well this was awful. USDCAD continued on a rampage upward and I was
caught on the wrong side of the fence. Total loss for this was 0.12% of
my account. At least I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">was light in it</a>. In retrospect, I broke my
own rule and didn't enter at one of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">4 fundamental entry points</a>.
However, after some bear rampage throughout the markets today
(Bloomberg: [Stocks Plunge on Concern Rising Debt, Job Losses Threaten
Global Recovery][]), USDCAD is at the top of my channel as shown in
Figure 1 below. So while my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">previous entry</a>
was early. USDCAD at this price is a good short. I will take it slow
this time by setting a limit order below current support on the 4-hour
at 1.0680, with a stop at 1.0750. And then adding a second chunk at
1.0640, my stopped out price. As is customarily lately, I am only
risking 0.1% of my account on the initial order. On a weekly chart,
1.0750 to 1.0810 is obviously a strong resistance for the USDCAD. It is
a congestion zone in 2007 and 2008. Then USDCAD spent the last quarter
of 2009 trying to break this resistance to no avail. But who knows,
perhaps USDCAD has had enough and it will break this resistance
decisively soon. That's why I'm only betting on this reversal with
limited risk. It's just a matter of wait and see now.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Taking a first position in USD/CAD short here at 1.0573 on a 4-hour
moving averages cross-over (Figure 1). I've also placed a limit order to
add more at 1.0519 below Fibonacci support (shown in Figure 1). Reason
for this trade is that USD/CAD is moving away from an upper bound
channel with a overbought stochastic reading, as shown in the daily
chart of Figure 2. I've also considered going long AUD/USD, but AUD/CAD
trend remains bearish. So I chose to short USD/CAD instead. Secondly,
crude oil (and gold too) looks to be bouncing off an oversold level with
a rapid move in 2 days from 72.43 to 77.39. Coincidentally, INO.com
posted an intermediate term <a href="http://www.ino.com/info/513/CD4184/&amp;dp=0&amp;l=0&amp;campaignid=3">cyclical analysis video with a bullish
outlook</a> (affiliate link). They put out a better case than I do.
USD/CAD might make a short-term upward bounce here because of a
short-term oversold condition. However, there's evidently a lack of
buyers in the past few hours (Fig. 1). The price has been sitting on
support a bit too long in my view. Thus, I'm expecting it to break
without a meaningful retracement (hence the short entry). A confirmation
would be a break below 1.0530. Thus I have a limit order to short more
below that price. I am risking 0.1% of my account on this trade. As you
may have noticed, these charts are from Metatrader. I'm switching over
to the MT4 platform as of today. Having played with its charting
features for the past few hours, I'm quite satisfied with it so far.
Although my needs are low as I was fine with the Oanda platform too
(arguably the most simplistic platform out there). [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>GBP/JPY finally broke below an intermediate term wedge pattern formed
from Dec 30. See Figure 1 for the daily chart. I am noticeably late in
this GBP/JPY short entry because I was preoccupied with other positions
(e.g. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/closed-eurchf-and-gbpchf-shorts-best-trade-ever/">my EUR/CHF and GBPCHF shorts</a>) today. In any case, this is an
intermediate term (a few days at least) play so there is no rush. My
first short was executed at 146.51 on obvious signs of short term pound
weakness versus the GBP/CHF pairs. GBP/JPY made some retracement on a
test of 146.00 but GBP/CHF kept on dropping, so I took a short position
once it touched the 146.50 resistance. My average price in this is
146.32. I have set my stop loss to lock in some profits already (which
might get taken out soon). Note that I just happened to be watching the
GBP/CHF currency pair as I have a position on shorting that too.
Otherwise EUR/GBP and GBP/USD would have been better for short-term
intermarket analysis because of higher liquidity. With regard to this
formation, as you can see on Figure 1, today's break of 147.50 gave way,
all the way, down to 143.00. This target price is estimated from the
height of the wedge pattern which it just broke through. The distance
from 147.50 to 143.00 is about the distance of the height of the wedge
(Dec 29th low to 30th high). Another reason for targeting this 143.00
price is because of my weekly chart of Figure 2. 142.50-143.00 is the
next support according to a long term trendline (lowest ascending white
line) as shown in Figure 2. GBP/JPY haven't seen these prices for a good
month, so hopefully the move down shouldn't be too difficult. As usual,
I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">stockpile my short position</a> in this gradually to limit risk.</p>
