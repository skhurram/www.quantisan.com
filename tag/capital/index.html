            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I typed a rather long reply on the SMB Training blog to <a href="http://www.smbtraining.com/blog/traders-ask-how-much-capital-do-i-need-to-trade">the question of
how much capital one needs to start trading</a>. So I thought I might as
well expand on this frequently asked question for traders visiting here.
Here is my process. The first thing to realize is the fact that trading
is a business. And like any business, the single most important question
to ask is -- what is your bottom line? That can be simplified to two
parts. What do you expect to make and what are your costs? Let's
consider your expectation first. You can't estimate your expectation if
you don't know what you did (that would be a haphazard guess). When I
dipped my hands in trading forex the first time. I started by paper
trading a demo account for a few months. As I was unfamiliar with
trading forex, that provided me with a risk-free opportunity to learn.
Equally more importantly, it serves as a Monte Carlo experiment (perhaps
more on this another time) to figure out my expected performance
statistics in this particular market (for example, here's my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">January
2010 review</a>). That is how you can scientifically derive your trading
expectation. Based on history. Yes, past performance is no guarantee of
future return. But at least it should give you a ballpark figure. So
unless someone can suggest a better method, you need to seriously grind
it out on a demo account first. (I only said this is straightforward. I
didn't say this is easy.) Fortunately, that is the hard part. Next step
to figuring out your costs is easy. Just calculate your trading
commission, data fees, etc. Then estimate how much fees you are paying
per trade. This is the cost basis of your trading. Then here are the
steps for calculating your initial capital need.</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate your average return percentage (of total principle) per
    trade from your paper trading.</li>
<li>Make an educated guess on your capital need, just to initialize the
    numerical process.</li>
<li>Calculate how much average amount of money you expect to make per
    trade using #1 and #2.</li>
<li>Divide your cost basis per trade with #3 to get a percentage of
    cost per trade.</li>
<li>Reiterate steps #2 to #4 until your percentage of cost per trade
    is acceptable. i.e. increase your capital (#2) if your percentage
    of cost is too high, and vice versa.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, say you expect to make an average +1% of your total account
per trade (step #1). Then let's say you thought an \$10,000 account is
enough (#2). \$10,000 x 0.01 = \$100. So you can expect to make an
average of \$100 per trade (#3). And let's say your fees is \$5 per
trade. A round-trip (buy and sell) would cost you \$5 x 2 = \$10. Thus,
#4 is found by \$10 / \$100 = 10%. Which means you'll be set back by
10% on every single trade. That cost percentage is too high. Then let's
double the capital to \$20,000 and go through steps #2 to #4 again.
Assuming your fees per trade is fixed, which is most likely for small
accounts. You'll find that your cost percentage is 5% for a \$20,000
account based on the same conditions. Perhaps 5% is acceptable for you?
If not, raise your capital estimate again and re-do the calculations (a
spreadsheet would be useful). The process is straightforward and
unambiguous. Once you've done your paper trading, the actual calculation
should take less time to do than reading this post.</p>
