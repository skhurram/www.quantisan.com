            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I spent a few months between 2010 and 2011 not on the market, not on
coming up with new strategies, but on developing a software framework
for my trading system. For my trading strategy development, I make use
of a continuous systems development life cycle process from the
engineering realm. Starting from planning, to analysis, to design, to
implementation, to maintenance, and finally, back to planning, and so on
for each and every new concept that I have. (see <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/04/in-praise-of-failure/all/1">Sir James Dyson's
guest column on Wired</a>) Imagine that if you need to write a new
strategy file for each and every idea and for each of its design
iteration. Pretty soon you'll have many strategy files and a lot of
boilerplate codes. What if you found a bug or figured out some
enhancements to a particular component of your strategy? Then you'll
have to sift through all those files and make the changes to all those
relevant codes to make the update across the board. Hopefully, this
isn't the approach you're taking. Yet, a few trading API that I have
used before inherently encourage or even limit you (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">EasyLanguage and
MQL4</a>) to this archaic procedural programming paradigm. Luckily, Java
is an object-oriented programming language. However, it is only as
object-oriented as you make it to be. JForex, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/jforex">the trading API that I
use</a>, actually runs on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/more-trouble-with-jforex-iindicators/">the edge of breaking this
object-orientedness</a> as I have recently lamented. The bad news for the
beginning developer is that practically every published strategy which I
have seen or <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/source-code/">guilty of posting myself</a> are illustrations of what not
to do with software design. In that there's none in it whatsoever. Think
of common published strategies like the Ikea mini-model showrooms.
Everything is crammed into a tiny space but it is a simple way to convey
the gist of a room design (read: the trading algorithm). However, they
are not built for practical use. Real strategies are like suites in an
apartment building. There is an underlying architectural commonality for
easy management and maintenance while enabling diversity in the
strategies. My recently completed software framework dramatically made
my life easier in the tasks of implementation and maintenance. Software
maintenance, in particular, is most often needlessly and overly
complicated in trading strategy development because of the lack of a
good design. Because at the end of the day, most programmers spend the
majority of their time debugging, maintaining, and extending their code.
A true object-oriented design decouples all its components so that you
can use a divide and conquer approach with no repetition of work. Do you
have a development process in place? I'd like to hear how you tackle
this problem.</p> </div>
