            <div class="article-content"> <p>Perhaps third times' the charm? I tried to short USDCAD twice last week
already. Both times I've been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-out-of-usdcad-short-1-0640-for-67-pips-re-entering-1-0680/">stopped out</a> for a total of -0.2% of
account loss. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">intermediate term analysis</a> remains the same as
before. So I won't repeat myself here. Entry signal for this particular
short is shown in Figure 1. I'm just using the 4-hour chart as I have a
well defined (recent top) stop this time. I compensate with a smaller
position size to limit my risk to 0.1%. Reward / Risk = (1.05761 -
1.0671) / (1.0671 - 1.0756) = 1.11 [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well this was awful. USDCAD continued on a rampage upward and I was
caught on the wrong side of the fence. Total loss for this was 0.12% of
my account. At least I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">was light in it</a>. In retrospect, I broke my
own rule and didn't enter at one of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">4 fundamental entry points</a>.
However, after some bear rampage throughout the markets today
(Bloomberg: [Stocks Plunge on Concern Rising Debt, Job Losses Threaten
Global Recovery][]), USDCAD is at the top of my channel as shown in
Figure 1 below. So while my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">previous entry</a>
was early. USDCAD at this price is a good short. I will take it slow
this time by setting a limit order below current support on the 4-hour
at 1.0680, with a stop at 1.0750. And then adding a second chunk at
1.0640, my stopped out price. As is customarily lately, I am only
risking 0.1% of my account on the initial order. On a weekly chart,
1.0750 to 1.0810 is obviously a strong resistance for the USDCAD. It is
a congestion zone in 2007 and 2008. Then USDCAD spent the last quarter
of 2009 trying to break this resistance to no avail. But who knows,
perhaps USDCAD has had enough and it will break this resistance
decisively soon. That's why I'm only betting on this reversal with
limited risk. It's just a matter of wait and see now.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Taking a first position in USD/CAD short here at 1.0573 on a 4-hour
moving averages cross-over (Figure 1). I've also placed a limit order to
add more at 1.0519 below Fibonacci support (shown in Figure 1). Reason
for this trade is that USD/CAD is moving away from an upper bound
channel with a overbought stochastic reading, as shown in the daily
chart of Figure 2. I've also considered going long AUD/USD, but AUD/CAD
trend remains bearish. So I chose to short USD/CAD instead. Secondly,
crude oil (and gold too) looks to be bouncing off an oversold level with
a rapid move in 2 days from 72.43 to 77.39. Coincidentally, INO.com
posted an intermediate term <a href="http://www.ino.com/info/513/CD4184/&amp;dp=0&amp;l=0&amp;campaignid=3">cyclical analysis video with a bullish
outlook</a> (affiliate link). They put out a better case than I do.
USD/CAD might make a short-term upward bounce here because of a
short-term oversold condition. However, there's evidently a lack of
buyers in the past few hours (Fig. 1). The price has been sitting on
support a bit too long in my view. Thus, I'm expecting it to break
without a meaningful retracement (hence the short entry). A confirmation
would be a break below 1.0530. Thus I have a limit order to short more
below that price. I am risking 0.1% of my account on this trade. As you
may have noticed, these charts are from Metatrader. I'm switching over
to the MT4 platform as of today. Having played with its charting
features for the past few hours, I'm quite satisfied with it so far.
Although my needs are low as I was fine with the Oanda platform too
(arguably the most simplistic platform out there). [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>CAD/JPY failed a major resistance level at 90 and has edged out an
obvious intermediate-term downtrend (Fig 1). USD/CAD is also bouncing
off a major support at 1.0200 (Fig. 2). And crude oil is below \$80 on a
slippery slope. As such, shorting loonie seems like a good move at the
moment according to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC trading setup</a>. Yet, here is why I am
opting to short CAD/JPY and not long the more popular USD/CAD currency
pair. Figure 3 shows a 5-year, weekly chart of CAD/JPY (top) and USD/CAD
(bottom). Evidently, the exchange rate of CAD/JPY is still in a
depressed mode since the fall of September 2008. It's also clear on this
chart that why I say 90 is a major resistance level. Beside from being a
nice round number, CAD/JPY has failed to break above 90 twice since
August 2009. As for USD/CAD, the picture isn't as clear. 1.0200 is
definitely a very strong support because it marks the top of a 6-month
range in the first half of 2008. Yet, the downward slope in the long
term since 2005 is not to be ignored. As such, I do not dare to bet on a
bounce on this pair at this price. Moreover, the intermediate-term move
on both of these pair is giving us a confirmation. CAD/JPY is now
testing a falling trendling (Fig. 1). Whereas USD/CAD is testing a
falling support. Thus, I am shorting CAD/JPY under pressure. Going long
on USD/CAD now would be like betting it to bounce on a slippery slope.</p>
