            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Gold price made a 15 point jump over the weekend to 1160 and is
consolidating now (Fig. 1). Crude oil tested 84 and is back down to just
above 83 now. Yet, AUDCAD is still struggling to break above 9600 (Fig.
2). You would have thought that AUDCAD should mustered enough momentum
to break above this key resistance with all these gold bullishness and
oil bearishness. Thus, I am giving this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audcad-0-9489-stop-9540/">AUDCAD short setup as described
previously</a> another try. I am only risking 0.16% on this trade. It is
half of my usual initial entry. First because it is a FTR (reversal)
setup and second because I am in a 3% drawdown. So my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk
manaegment</a> rules dictate that I trade halved size. This setup is
according to the monthly and weekly chart, so it could take a while, and
probably more tries, before it shows its hands. I will keep shorting it
as long as it's below 9600 on the weekly. Limited by the amount at risk
according to my risk management rules, of course!</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been stopped out of all my Aussie shorts on the breakout today. But
my setups for AUDUSD and AUDJPY are still intact as the resistances are
still safe. Having failed so many times in shorting AUDJPY (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">first
try</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-retrying-audjpy-short-84-52-stop-85/">second try</a>), I am taking a conservative approach on that
particular play. Although those setups are ripe for entries, I'll wait
til the test of resistances hold first before entering short again in
AUDJPY and AUDUSD. Which begs the question of, why AUDCAD, and why now?
First of all, I still have conviction about my Aussie short because of
the setups as <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">discussed previously</a> and the fact that gold
price is holding the 40 day ema at 1135 at the moment. That 40 day ema
has worked well on the uptrend in the past few months. So it should be
respected if gold is indeed in a downtrend now as I surmise. So why
short AUDCAD instead of the popular AUDUSD? Simply because AUDUSD broke
out of a short term range whereas AUDCAD is still holding as seen in the
AUDCAD 3-hour chart of Figure 1. This shows AUDCAD is weaker even when
gold is making new short term high.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUD/CAD,
3-hour"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_3h.PNG" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>For the big picture, see Figure 2 for the weekly chart of AUD/CAD. We
see that 0.98-0.99 has always been the turning point for a massive 1000+
pips selloff. We've hit 0.99 back in November and the slide is already
in progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see from Figure 2 that AUDCAD bounced off the 40 week ema
in late December and ran up to 0.95 from 0.92. 0.95 is a decidedly
important round number resistance as it was also a peak in April of
2007. You know, the time before the economy started to crack as shown
with the topping in the markets.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUDCAD,
weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD.png">1</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Now that I've established that the trend is pointing down. I still need
to time my short entry.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the daily chart of AUDCAD. In view of the above
discussion, we have a good chunk of resistance above 9550 as marked by
the purple box in Figure 3. This is the all important safety net for
this short entry. As long as AUDCAD stays below 9600, this long term
setup remains intact. And don't forget the broken uptrend line.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUDCAD,
daily"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_day.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_day.png">2</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Lastly, notice the RSI trends in both the 3-hour (Fig. 1) and daily
charts (Fig 3.), they are both showing negative divergences. Figure 1 is
my timing for this entry, see the current negative RSI divergence marked
by the downward trend in RSI versus the toppy price.</p>
<p>In summary, here are my signals for this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC setup</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Weekly chart shows downward trend.</li>
<li>Big resistance above current price on daily.</li>
<li>Broken uptrend line on daily on retracement from weekly chart.</li>
<li>Intermarket relation with gold testing 40 day ema at 1135.</li>
<li>Negative RSI divergence on 3-hour chart.</li>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After many trials and errors with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex market</a>
for a month, the first of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setups</a> is finally taking shape.
So I would like to document this approach here after a well executed
trade this week (illustrated below). This trading setup is based solely
on technical analysis. Here's an overview of the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a long term time frame for identifying setup.</li>
<li>Draw the major supports and resistances.</li>
<li>Add a momentum technical indicator.</li>
<li>Add a trend indicator.</li>
<li>An entry is signaled by an agreement of the trend and the indicator
    at the support or resistance price level. Do not enter yet.</li>
<li>Define a short term time frame for timing, use this for the
    following steps.</li>
<li>Draw the supports and resistances on this short time frame.</li>
<li>Place an order when the price breaks the short-term trend to be
    aligned with the trend on the longer one.</li>
<li>Exit when the entry conditions are gone (not necessarily reversed).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is very vague. So here's a real example in practice. Figure 1 shows
steps 1 to 5 on the daily chart of CAD/JPY for a short entry. The entry
point is the bar before the marked vertical line on Oct 21. See that
CAD/JPY tested the descending resistance line (step #2) with a negative
RSI divergence (#3). The trend as suggested by the moving averages is a
choppy downtrend (#4). Thus, the conditions were met and a short entry
is signaled. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"
caption="CAD/JPY"][<img alt="CAD/JPY" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy.png" />]<a href="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy.png">CAD/JPY</a>[/caption] For timing the
entry, Figure 2 is a 3-hour chart of CAD/JPY with the entries and exits
marked. Yellow triangles are entries and red dots are exits. I entered a
full position after CAD/JPY made the initial dive and then retraced to
the previous support (now resistance) line. It bounced right off that
line strongly (left side of figure). I entered at market price once we
made a hammer candlestick (negative signal) the bar before. Stop was
placed at 88.0, near the recent high and at a round number resistance.
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="CAD/JPY,
3-hour"][<img alt="CAD/JPY, 3-hour" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy_3h.png" />]<a href="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy_3h.png">CAD/JPY, 3-hour</a>[/caption] For the exit,
I had a manually adjusted hard stop to be a couple of resistances away.
I kept it loose on purpose because this position was my biggest winner.
(Let your profits run). But once the RSI on the daily passed below 50, I
took a more conservative approach on the exit stop. Then once CAD/JPY
tested 84.50 and hung around 85.0, I tightened my stop and was taken out
at 85.30. Note that my original target was 84.0, so I thought testing
84.50 was close enough. Also note that this setup is expected to be
executed recursively. It is meant to be run so that you're <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">stacking up
your winning position</a> if the conditions and the trend is in your
favour. This is actually where the power with this setup kicks in. I'll
continue with the CAD/JPY example to illustrate this point. Notice in
Figure 2 that I added to this CAD/JPY short at the (second from the
right) yellow triangle point on the chart at 86.3 for 50% more units.
The down move was still intact as shown in Figure 1 at the time. Using
the same setup, I added more units to this position. And by adding 50%
more to my position, I was able to ride that last wave down for +200
pips on these extra units. Otherwise, I would have exited at 85.30 on
the consolidation around 85.0 and left with nothing on the market for
the last big wave. The timing as shown in Figure 2 for this addition
isn't the same as for the original entry. But it's obvious enough on the
figure with the same markings which I used. Simply refer to Figure 2 for
a visual explanation on the timing for this entry. In case you haven't
noticed on Figure 2, but I just re-entered this position with half the
size using the same setup. Since this third entry is still in progress,
I can't comment on it just yet. We'll see how it goes. Finally, for ease
of referencing this trading setup later on, I will call this particular
setup, FTC (forex trend-continuation). Right now it's version 0.1, a
first publication release but still in beta testing with my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper
trading</a>. Once the setup has proven itself, I will use it in live
trading with real money. Then I will christen it with a version 1.0, and
perhaps a better name. In the mean time, I expect more refinement to
this setup as I continue to try it out on paper trading. Check my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC
tag</a> for more sample applications of this trading signal. Update Nov
18, 2009: I've changed the name from FTCS to FTC as I now have a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTR">FTR</a>
setup.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This log is written about 18 hours after the entry. I entered long
USD/CAD at the market last night for a 1/4 position size. USD/CAD took a
brief run up of about 100 pips. Naturally, I moved the stop to just
above breakeven to make this a risk-free trade for over the weekend. I
entered this position for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strong support at 1.0300, Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Positive divergence of lower low, higher RSI since August.</li>
<li>Break of short-term resistance, see Fig. 2</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that both Figures were taken at the time of entry 18 hours ago.
Position size: 25% Entry: 1.02988 Stop: 1.02080 Target: 1.0550, although
1.0400 might be hard to break. Reward / Risk = 251.2 / 90.8 = 2.7 \&lt; 3.
That's why I'm only entering a 1/4 position to test the water.</p>
