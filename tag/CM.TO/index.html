            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market seem ready to crack but it is not. So I am taking profit on
my CIBC short here on a weaker volumn retest of the \$70.50 support
(Figure 1). I bought <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cm-to-10oct-puts-5-00-mark-74-02/">3 puts contracts four weeks ago at \$5.00</a> when
CM was trading at \$74.02. Then I [added 3 more contracts with the same
strike price and expiry for \$5.65][] when CM was trading at \$72.30.
The average cost was \$5.35. Thus, profit is \$750 - (\$12.95 + \$3.00)
x 2 = \$718.10 = 8.0% of total account.</p>

<p>This is the last of my positions. I have no more outstanding position in
any market. CM.TO looks to be on the brink of a collapse. I may be
making a mistake here by offloading my shorts before the fireworks.
However, as I was saying, the market is still hanging on. Furthermore,
there's a positive divergence for CM.TO as shown on Figure 2 according
to the oscillator at the top of the chart. So I am taking profit now to
reduce my risk as this position is relatively big for my small RRSP
trading account.</p>

about half an hour before the close. \$72.50 is the 50% retracement
level on that big dive in beginning of May. See Figure 1. Moreover,
\$72.50 is the bottom of a congestion zone in middle of May.</p>

<p>The trading volumes in CM.TO and the TSX index are weak. So I am betting
that the market won't follow through with this upward move. Mental stop
is \$73.00 and \$74.00 as hard stop.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been watching CIBC (CM.TO) for a few months now. CM finally
presented a shorting opportunity that I took today. Figure 1 speaks for
itself. Furthermore, the lackluster rally in EUR/USD after the ECB's
vouch for confidence is encouraging for the bears.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="CIBC

<p>\$74.00 - \$74.50 is a strong resistance for CM. There are three
scenarios in which this trade can play out. CM can go up, go down, or
move sideway. If CM move upward, I will watch the push above \$74.50. My
current exit stop is at \$75.00 (about \$1 on the premium). However, as
this is an options position. There is a time decay factor working
against me. As such, I will decrease my exit stop by \$1.00 on the share
price every month to compensate. For example, by mid-June, my exit stop
is \$74.00 on the underlying share price of CM. If CM move downward, I
will move my stop to breakeven if it breaks below \$72. If CM move
sideway, I will give it a month's time. If CM just consolidates around
\$74, I will exit by late June for a loss of \$1 (\$300 total) on the
premium. My targets are \$70, \$68, and \$65 as shown on Figure 1. I
will tighten my stop passing each support level. My ideal loss is \$300
at most. That represents 3.4% of my total account on this trade.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Warning: Top/bottom picking is a dangerous art. I don't intend to trade
on this information myself. I did this out of pure curiosity. The
Canadian banks are an interesting phenomenon. Are they just hiding dirt
under the rug or are they really as good as our government say? Mish
Global Economic Trend Analysis posted a bearish view on <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2010/03/california-usa-vs-ontario-canada-which_29.html">California v.
Ontario</a>. Furthermore, The Baseline Scenario discussed [why the
strength of our banks is an illusion created by our government][]. As
such, on both a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/td-bank-making-headlines-with-a-new-all-time-high/">technical</a> and fundamental viewpoint, share prices of
our financial sector is way overbought. Of which, CIBC (CM.TO) seem
particularly screwed as its stock price hasn't been able to join in the
unreal rally of late. That sentiment seem to be confirmed with an
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/using-option-pain-max-pain-to-estimate-stock-price/">option pain valuation</a> as I described before. Max pain for CM.TO for
April expiration is pegged at \$72. Not surprisingly, \$72 marks a long
term support as shown in Figure 2 (blue line). A break below \$72 could
summon \$65. The data also show that there is a large open interest for
put options at the \$72 strike. Are they sold as covered puts or
something else? That I cannot tell. However, \$72 will definitely be an
important level for CM.TO in the near future. Nevertheless, as the
options market is small in Canada, I wouldn't put much weight on options
valuation for Canadian stocks. The value of open interest options on
April CM.TO is merely about the size of a single day's of equity traded.
P.S. March's max pain was \$68 one week prior to expiration. But CM.TO
closed above \$75 on March expiration. That wasn't even close.</p>
