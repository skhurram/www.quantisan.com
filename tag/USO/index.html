            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Here's finally a real order after a string of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trades</a>. Remember
USO? I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-35/">was long in USO</a> not too long ago. Well, the same channel that
told me to exit my long position is looking toppy.</p>
<p>One thing I learned from my USO trade is that this ETF is a money losing
game. [The roll over every month of contracts put a severe strain on USO
share price][]. And yesterday was the last day of this month's rollover.
At around 1:30pm yesterday, there were some significant volume with
dumping of USO shares at \$32. This is the first sign of distribution of
USO shares.</p>
<p>Then today, I see the same thing happening at the intraday resistance.
Sudden spike in volumes within seconds at the resistance of \$32.42.
This is a sign that a big player is dumping shares.</p>
<p>However, this is mere a conjecture on my part. This could also be a way
for some big players to rake in more shares. So don't rely on this too
much.</p>
<p>Looking at the bigger pictures though, I see weaknesses in the weekly
and daily charts too. Also, the break to the top of the up channel
(Figure 3) was only greeted by low volumes. So it's unlikely that we
will break further up from here.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a small play with a tight stop and high probability
(contango is on my side this time around) of success, that is if I don't
get stopped out first.</p>
<p>Short entry stop: \$32.21, just below some intraday congestion and
support from last week.</p>
<p>Exit stop: \$32.49, intraday top so far.</p>
<p>Target: \$29.50. 50% Fib level from this rally and near bottom of a huge
congestion zone in the recent months.</p>
<p>Reward / Risk = 2.71 / 0.28 = 9.7 > 3.0</p>
<p>Update: USO dipped below \$32 in the pre-market on Monday. But I'll pass
because I'm very low on available cash in my trading account. I need to
limit my risk exposure even though I still think this is a great
opportunity. I'll put this one in a <strong>paper trade</strong> just to see how it
goes. Order is set for an entry short stop at \$31.99 to be submitted at
3:30pm today.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just closed my USO long position. I bought back the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-175/">puts that I wrote
for \$1.75 about a month ago</a>. This represents a realized profit of
\$280 - \$15 for commission. I actually wanted to get out of this
position last Friday when USO tested \$30. But <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/buy-stop-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-65/">my stop was never
triggered</a> so I held on to the options through the weekend, thinking
I'd benefit from the time decay anyway.</p>
<p>Today, USO reached \$30.50 with some relatively low volume. \$30.50 also
mark the top of a recent up channel (Figure 2). With my limited profit
potential at this point, I'm inclined to take my profit than risk a
retracement.</p>
<p>This trade has certainly been a roller coaster ride. The <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/review-of-positions-srs-and-uso/">price of USO
didn't move up as planned</a>. It actually took a dive but picked itself
up back to around my entry price on a slow up move. In the end, it was
the time decay of the options that helped to make this supposedly losing
trade into a winning one.</p>
<p>This is another example to favour writing puts instead of buying shares
in this volatile market condition.</p>
<p>On another note, I'll look into USL instead of USO in the future for any
Oil trade. The April roll over contango took a stab at the USO price
last month. I was lucky for the short put strategy saving me.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have placed an exit buy stop for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-175/">my USO short puts</a> at \$0.65. In
other words, I've placed an exit stop for my long USO position.</p>
<p>USO tested the recent up channel on low volume today. Furthermore, NY
Crude futures (QM) at \$53+ is nearing a long term resistance of \$55.
So there's not much upside left in this. Thus, I've placed an exit stop
just below an intraday support to take some profit. I'm just trying not
to be greedy here. I'll write a more thorough analysis if this stop gets
triggered today.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-31-srs-4808/">SRS position is deep underwater</a>. To add to the mistake, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-srs-100-may-09-35-put-610/">added
to it last Thursday in a hurry</a> hoping for a rebound from a massive
selloff to a new 52-week low. Even though the chart looked like it was
testing support last Thursday, I <strong>should have waited for a rebound
before entering</strong>. And second, <strong>if I don't even have the time to write
my trade log, I should never enter a trade</strong>.</p>
<p>This is definitely a wakeup call to rectify my tendency of entering too
early in the short term. I have since mentally walked through what I
should have done and have come up with a simple entry strategy that I
will follow from now on. Basically, I will wait validation of a intraday
low and then enter only if it passes its intraday resistance. Then I
will set a hard stop just below a recent support. This will no doubt
create a lot more stopped out trades, but it's up to me to find high
probability trades. All it needs now is some verification...</p>
<p>In any case, I clearly need to spend less time trading and more time
developing my skills and strategies.</p>
<p>Back to the positions at hand. From Figure 1, SRS is at the bottom of a
long term down trend. Stop is \$30. Target is \$41. From the look of it,
SRS will be going down even further if the market can hold its ground
above 850. However, if the market fails to climb up, then yesterday's
slightly higher low than Monday is a small plus point for SRS.</p>
<p>Update: Interestingly, in today's news <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123979197193420547.html">U.S. Foreclosures Jumped in
March</a> and General Growth Files For Bankruptcy: Report. The 2nd news
came in the middle of the night. And it's nowhere to be found unless you
really look for it. I only read about it from <a href="http://caracommunity.com/content/caras-commentary-community-chat-thurs-apr-16-2009">CaraCommunity</a>. For one
of the largest REIT to declare bankruptcy, you'd think it'd be all over
the news. Doesn't take a genious to figure this incident is deliberately
hidden.</p>

<p>My USO position is faring better, although it's merely hovering above
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-175/">my entry price</a>. Now that the <a href="http://shockedinvestor.blogspot.com/2009/04/uso-rollover-report-for-april.html">April roll over of USO</a> is complete,
the downward pressure on USO should be gone. Even during the roll over,
USO has managed to remain above its upward trendline. This is definitely
a big plus.</p>
<p>New stop is \$28.80 and conservative target is \$32.</p>
