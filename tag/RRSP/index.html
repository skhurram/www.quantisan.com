                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1000-pmvvn-062/" rel='bookmark'>Bought 1000 PMV.VN @ 0.62</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p><strong>Update January 26:</strong> The share price of PMV.V crossed my mental stop
yesterday so I had to reassess the position. I sold my shares at \$0.56
for a loss of (\$0.56 - \$0.62) * 1000 = \$70 + \$19.90 commission =
\$89.90 = 0.9% of account. Gold is falling while USD tanked this week.
The lack of volume on today's goldminers rally is also uncharacteristic
of the recent uptrend. The long term uptrend of gold and gold miners is
unmistakable on both fundamental and technical basis. I am taking a
dabble in this junior gold miner as its share price is making a gap fill
on a recent breakout (Fig. 1), amongst other things. Intraday chart
(Fig. 2) is also showing signs of life at this support level. What's
going to happen to gold as it breaks below 1350 (first time since
November) from worries about Chinese inflation, which led to strength in
USD (on fear of further Chinese tightening) as EURUSD dropped 60 pips in
2 hours. See FT: <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ab89d906-244e-11e0-a89a-00144feab49a.html">Fears grow that China is overheating</a>. Couple that
with political and economic uncertainty, we have a short term
uncertainty in gold's direction. However, all these is in line with the
underlying gold-bug case that money is becoming more worthless as
governments pump in money to their respective economies. Another point
to note is that as the Shanghai Composite and Bombay Stock Exchange
(i.e. growth markets) are making 3-month lows in recent weeks, people
will start to look for other assets to diversify their wealth. This is
all conjectures anyway. I can't predict the future.I am merely placing
my bet as the stars seem to have aligned for me to increase the
probability of this good reward/risk trade. Mental stop is \$0.55. Hard
stop is \$0.48, however, I'll give it some margin and say 0.40 is my
stop as liquidity is thin in this junior. Thus, risk is (\$0.62 -
\$0.40) * 1000 = \$220 + \$9.95 commission = \$229.95 = 2.4% of
account. Note: You might have noticed that my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a> style has
changed for 2011. I am trying to jot down my thought process rather than
the data analysis and numerical logic to better capture my <em>thinking</em>
for the record.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm out of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-200-lll-to-47-04-stop-46-50/">my Lululemon position</a> minutes prior to the close. Holding
time was just a day. I would have liked to hold this position for longer
but the market is directionless. In addition, the stop hunt on the
shorts in LLL.TO is unmistakable as seen in Figure 1. Option expiration
is this Friday. So I'm taking my profit now prior to expected
volatility. A reward/risk of 2 to 1 is too tempting to let go. However,
LLL.TO is pushing higher into the close. So perhaps this is yet another
lack of patience on my part. Update Nov 18: Yes, I was too early indeed.
LLL.TO gapped upward the day after my exit. Option pain is pegged at
\$45 on the American shares (NASDAQ:LULU). LULU is trading just above
\$47 as I close my position. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

(\$48.00 - \$47.04) * 200 = \$192 - \$9.90 commission = \$182.1 = 1.9%

most of my losses in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/covered-4-mfc-11jan-puts-14-00-mx-0-45-mark-14-80-loss-2-3/">my worst trade this year</a> within a week.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Market is tanking (Figure 1). Lots of pessimism in the news. Time for me
to load on some growth stocks. I'm passing the goldminers in this move
as the dollar seem to be rising from the dead and gold may be
consolidating.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TSX, 12500 looks

<p>Instead, I'm picking a growth stock, Lululemon (LLL.TO). Lululemon is
holding well in this down move. Furthermore, the intraday test of
support at 46.50 looks promising as there were few sellers at that price
level. The recent break above long-term resistance at 48 is good too. So
is the 19.6% short float... Anyway, you get the picture.</p>

EUR/USD is bouncing off a long term support around 1.3600. Thus I'm
covering my short in Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) before the weekend.
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/story-of-a-bad-trade-and-a-missed-opportunity/">This position turned out horribly</a>. I've been waiting for MFC.TO to
print 14.50, just above its 38.6% Fibonacci retracement level at 14.40
on the recent spike. But 14.80 doesn't seem to budge even today with all
that bearishness floating around. Intraday volume is also decreasing on
every new test of this intraday support. So I'm throwing in the towel
here. Loss is (\$0.45 - \$0.93) * 4 * 100 = -\$192 - \$27.90 =
-\$219.90 = -2.3% of account.</p>

topping COT (<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm">CFTC: Commitments of Traders</a>) lagging open interest
data (bottom of Fig. 1). I waited for a breakdown in the hourly chart
(Fig. 2) to make my entry into this short. The market has been coiling
up for the entire month of October. Something big is about to happen
sooner or later. Perhaps the U.S. midterm election tomorrow can finally
move this market? Stop is at 8.80. Risk is (\$9.03 - \$8.80) * 250 =

is still small with this lack of market volume.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I shorted some crude oil to hedge my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-300-ven-to-8-95-stop-8-80/">gold miner long</a> right at 2 pm
today. EURUSD looks to be trading in a range. And since FOMC and G20 are
right around the corner, I am not expecting the market to do anything
drastic (i.e. breakout). So I am shorting commodity (to long US dollar)
as EUR/USD is at the top of its channel (Fig. 1). I picked Horizons
BetaPro Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) because it's one of the most active
reverse ETF on the TSX. I considered buying HFD.TO (for shorting
financials) but that one has a fraction of the volume of HOD.TO. The
falling star candle right below the 82.50 resistance on the hourly chart
of crude oil (Fig. 2) is also a factor in my timing. Risk is (\$9.19 -
\$9.05) * 300 = \$42 + \$9.90 commission = \$51.90 = 0.5% of account.
Figures 1 and 2 were captured at the time of entry. The markets are
still hanging on the ceiling approaching the close. [caption id=""
