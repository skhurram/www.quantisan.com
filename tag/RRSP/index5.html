            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am shorting Natural Gas via the Horizons 2x leveraged bearish ETF
(HND.TO). The U.S. Energy Information Association (EIA) released their
<a href="http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html">weekly natural gas storage report</a> yesterday. The underground storage
amount is only 4.9% above last year's level. However, as <a href="http://shockedinvestor.blogspot.com/2010/05/why-natural-gas-should-be-shorted-or.html">Shocked
Investor points out</a>, last year's amount was a record high. So 4.9%
above last year's is even higher. Figure 1 shows the two year graph of
natural gas storage and the 5-year avearge channel. [caption id=""

futures was testing \$4.50 resistance yesterday (Figure 2) within a
prolonged downtrend. As such, both fundamental and technical shows
bearishness. So I shorted natural gas with HND.TO today on retracement
to \$7.25 support (Figure 3). This retracement is due to HND meeting
resistance at \$7.50 (50% Fibonacci level on the \$8 to \$7 drop this
week).</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update May 10: Looks like I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-illustration-of-what-it-means-by-missing-the-boat-in-trading/">missed the boat</a>. TCK.B gapped up almost
7% at the Monday open to \$38.88. I won't be chasing the market at this
point as the reward/risk ratio isn't appealing anymore. Update: I got
stopped out at breakeven (after commission) before I can post this piece
at the end of the day. I'm back to all cash going into the weekend. I am
taking a dip in Teck Resources (TCK/B.TO) with 110 shares bought at
\$36.03. This is a trade to "buy when everyone else is in fear".
Following my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-hell-and-back-a-review-of-tsx-after-a-v-day/">assessment of the market yesterday</a>, I don't think
things are that bad, yet. So I am establishing a small position in a
strong company today. TCK is trading on its 200 day moving average at
\$35 this week (Figure 1). Yesterday's epic dive and recovery didn't
break this \$35 support. So that's a very good sign for TCK.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Tech Resources
(TCK-B.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO.png" />][][/caption] Furthermore, \$35 is an obvious
psychological round number support. It is also above the recent low of
\$32.50 printed in February of this year as shown in Figure 1. The
oscillator value (top of Figure 1) is making a positive divergence as
TCK is testing this support level). I entered today based on the 5-day
intraday chart. This morning's opening hour test of \$35 support has
lower volume than earlier this week (Figure 2). As such, I think \$35
can hold. So I entered when the price shot above minor resistance at
\$36.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TCK-B.TO
intraday snapshot at time of entry"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO-intraday.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO-intraday.png">1</a>[/caption] The price
drifted back under \$35.50 after I entered but then reversed and tested
\$37. I moved my stop loss to breakeven as it touched an equidistance
price opposite of my stop. Just so I don't see profits turn into losses.
If I get stopped out today, I will not re-enter until after the weekend.
My target is \$40 and original stop was \$35 for about a 4 to 1 reward
to risk ratio. I am risking 1.25% in this trade with a position size of
110 shares.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) position this morning as crude
oil broke below \$80 briefly and the Dollar Index rose above \$84.
My<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">original target was \$27</a> for this short. But considering the fact
that I mistakenly doubled my position size, I am closing this trade a
step above at this \$27.50 support level (see Figure 1 for CVE.TO
support lines). Furthermore, the time decay on the options premium is
accelerating so I needed to sell this soon. The final profit on this
position is \$858.15 (after \$63.80 commission), or just over 10% in my
RRSP account. Although this trade is profitable, it is a horrible trade
for the following reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>I accidentally <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-just-made-a-grave-fundamental-mistake-in-my-cve-to-trade/">bought more contracts when I intended to sell</a>.</li>
<li>Not correcting my mistake immediately.</li>
<li>I risked too much at 3% (of account) initially and then 10% after my
    mistake.</li>
<li>Peak drawdown was over \$1000 (12.5%) at one time.</li>
<li>Too eager to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-10jul17-puts-30-00-mx-2-45-mark-28-64/">add to my position once it moved</a>.</li>
<li>Reward-to-Risk ratio is less than 1.0, so I threw big money for
    smaller gain.</li>
<li>Commission ends up eating 7% of profit away. That is too much.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, I made one, two, ... seven too many mistakes in this
trade. Luckily, I did manage to do some things right.</p>
<ol>
<li>Patience. There were a few days when the price moved sideway. I
    didn't succumb to my emotions and dump the shares when it was nerve
    whacking to hold onto a loss. The price was still below my mental
    stop so I held.</li>
<li>After the initial shock of doubling my position as the price moved
    away, I mentally accepted my loss and was able to study the market
    objectively since.</li>
<li>Didn't take profit too early once the price moved back in my favour
    this week.</li>
</ol>
<p>I won't be as lucky every time. Learn from my mistakes and exploit on my
strengths. That is the lesson from this trade.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I made my first trade in my RRSP! It is a short on Cenovus Energy
(CVE.TO) via buying puts options. I chose the July expiry with the
intention to dispose of this position in May. Two reasons for that. 1)
Before time decay accelerates (about 60 days prior to expiry), and 2)
before the summer starts (low volatility in summer, premiums are
discounted). The following facts/opinions constituted my decision for
this entry.</p>
<ol>
<li>TSX index is toppy according to weekly RSI</li>
<li>TSX is losing steam this week versus the S&amp;P 500 (see Figure 1), but
    this is probably due to the forex market</li>
<li>MX Implied Volatility Index is testing 10.00 support again</li>
<li>Energy sector is weakest of all 3 prominent sectors on TSX (Energy,
    Financial, Material) in intermediate term</li>
<li>Oil is showing negative divergence on weekly chart</li>
<li>U.S. dollar index is in uptrend and testing support at 80</li>
<li>USD/CAD is testing major support at parity</li>
<li>CVE.TO looks weakest amongst top 5 traded Oil/Gas on TSX (for
    liquidity)</li>
<li>Negative divergence as seen on CVE.TO chart (Figure 2)</li>
<li>\$30 is a strong resistance level (Figure 2)</li>
<li>CVE.TO v. Crude Oil chart shows an intermediate term steady down
    trend</li>
</ol>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="512" caption="TSX Composite v.
S&amp;P 500"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-14-TSX-SPX.png" />][][/caption] Stop: \$32. Target: \$27. Commission paid
is \$12.95 on this trade (double that for a round trip). A rough
estimate of the premium by May expiry if CVE.TO is priced at \$32 then
would be \$0.80. Thus, I am risking about \$240 of my \$8,000 account in
this trade on a worst case scenario. Which is 3% of my RRSP account.
This is <em>significantly</em> more than my usual risk appetite (less than 0.2%
per trade in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex trading</a>). But any less would be pointless due to
the high relative commission for options. I had the choice of shorting
the market using options or leveraged bear ETF. The deteriorating value
of a bear ETF made it less favourable for holding for more than a few
days. So I traded options due to a lack of choices in my RRSP. Anyway,
that's my thought on this. Yet nothing matters but the price. Let's wait
and see how this goes. I plan to make one trade per quarter in my RRSP.
This one is for Q2.</p>
