                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-hypothetical-data-analysis-platform/" rel='bookmark'>A hypothetical data analysis platform</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My definition of a statistical platform is that it is a glue that ties orthogonal data analysis functions together. Take R for instance, it is a platform-as-application. You fire up R and everything is accessible to you. However, all the packages only work on top of R.</p>
<p>Python, on the other hand, take a platform-as-libraries approach. A basic data analaysis setup is to <code>pip install Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib</code>. High-level libraries, such as scikit-learn and pandas, are built on top of these. It is somewhat more flexible for picking and choosing but the dependency is still a tree-like structure between some packages.</p>
<p>Then there's Incanter.</p>
<p>You don't like to use Parallel Colt for your matrices? Here, try <a href="https://github.com/forward/incanter-BLAS">this BLAS drop-in replacement</a> and everything would just work with 10x speed. </p>
<p>Much of this flexibility is due to earlier design choices by Liebke et al. to leverage Clojure's idiom that "it is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures."</p>
<p>The thing is, I think we're only scratching the surface. Excuse me while I dream for a minute.</p>
<p>Say instead of jBLAS, you want to use CPU/GPU hybrid instead. Suppose you can just do a <code>(use 'incanter-magma)</code> and your Incanter code would just run with <a href="http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/software/index.html">MAGMA</a> (via <a href="http://matthewrocklin.com/">Mathew Rocklin</a>) under the hood without any other change.</p>
<p>Taking this idea of interfacing libraries into a hypothetical use case. Imagine that you cleaned and structured your data on Hadoop using <a href="http://cascalog.org/">Cascalog</a> and is looking to analyse this dataset. You start your Incanter session to pull in your data <code>(use 'incanter-cascalog)</code>. Write some Incanter script to interrogate this dataset but find the data is still too big for your laptop. So you <code>(use 'incanter-storm)</code> to make use of distributed processing instead. Incanter would then flow data directly from Cascalog to <a href="http://storm-project.net/">Storm</a> inside your cluster.</p>
<p>For your results, you find JFreeChart limiting so you <code>(use 'incanter-c2)</code> to spiff up your visualisations with <a href="http://keminglabs.com/c2/">C2</a> all while not changing a single line of your Incanter script.</p>
<p>Instead of the star-like dependency of R and its packages, or the tree-like structure for Python and its packages, Incanter could be an interface to stand-alone libraries encapsulated by an application for the user.</p>
<p>Incanter, the library, could be modules that transform data into standard Incanter-compatible data structures to and from external libraries. Incanter, the application, could be a domain specific language, a client, and a in-REPL package manager.</p>
<p>Another benefit to this is that it helps to mitigate the developer shortage problem for Incanter too by making use of external, stand-alone libraries.</p>
<p>I call this platform-as-interface.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just migrated this blog from a self-hosted Wordpress site to a Pelican statically generated blog. It took me a whole weekend to do it because I have almost 600 posts. Much is still broken at the moment but at least the site seems presentable so I pushed it through. The fixes will just have to wait.</p>
<p>I considered using Jekyll as it appears to be the most popular static site generator. A look at its github page though shows no patch has been made for months. Development on Jekyll appears to have paused for some reason. Furthermore, I didn't have much luck getting <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp">exitwp</a>, which is a wordpress xml to jekyll importer, to gracefully parse my many custom posting tags. I also gave <a href="http://www.ruhoh.com">Ruhoh</a> a quick trial, but it also relies on exitwp to import wordpress posts.</p>
<p>Then I found that <a href="http://doc.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> had its own importer tool using <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">pandoc</a>, which I tested works much better for the non-standard tags in my posts.</p>
<p>In any case, here are the steps I took to migrate to Pelican.</p>
<ol>
<li>Export Wordpress into a XML file</li>
<li>transfer comments to Disqus</li>
<li>install Pelican 3.0.0 dev build</li>
<li>use pelican-import to convert the XML file into markdown posts</li>
<li>moved some posts around into its directory/category</li>
<li>use Textmate to do a bunch of batch fixes</li>
<li>configure Pelican and made a Makefile</li>
<li><del>install ghp-import</del> rolled my own gh-pages script into Makefile</li>
<li>customised a <a href="https://github.com/Quantisan/pelican-svbtle">pelican theme</a></li>
<li>setup Github for custom domain</li>
<li>updated DNS</li>
</ol>
<p>After all of that, this site is now <a href="https://github.com/Quantisan/www.quantisan.com">hosted and served on github</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>One of the few benefits of working for myself is that I don't need to
worry about compatibility with legacy systems. I am free to use whatever
open source tools to get the job done well. The downside to this is that
there are so many technologies out there that it's hard to choose the
right ones for the job. To give you a sense of what I meant, here are
some of the topics that I have either tried or seriously considered in
the past year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming languages: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/java/">Java</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/python/">Python</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/R">R</a>, C#, F#, Scala,
    Clojure, Haskell.</li>
<li>Data storage: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/from-object-oriented-programming-to-object-oriented-design/">HDF5</a>, CSV, Binary, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB,
    MonetDB, Redis, HBase.</li>
<li>Cloud server: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/amazon-ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>, Microsoft Azure, [Google App
    Engine][], Rackspace Cloud, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/vps/">plain old VPSs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Programming language choices are important because they sit at the
bottom of a technology stack. Most of the work that I do are built on
using them. For a long while, I settled on using a combination of Java,
Python, and R. I prototype small ideas in Python. Implement production
code in Java. And perform analysis in R. I discussed why <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/data-analysis-with-r-using-the-right-tool-for-the-right-task/">use the right
tool for the right task</a> a year ago. By the end of my previous
project, I am finding that the popular development triplet of Java,
Python, and R, is not ideal for a solo-operation. Seeing that I have
more time on my hands because I am using QTD to trade for me now, I am
taking a break this summer to expand my knowledge and learn new
technologies. Some of the technologies that I am experimenting with
includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>an in-memory data store for instantaneous and persistent tick data</li>
<li>parallel programming for concurrent processing with no locks</li>
<li>mathematically intuitive algorithm implementations using high order
    functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't mind me as I help myself in this open buffet of technologies.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>One of the tasks that I've always wanted to make more efficient in my
stock trading is the work of scanning for stocks to trade. One look at
my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy posts</a> and you'll see that I have devised many
stock scanning systems in the past few years. The most recent system
that I've used is one that uses <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/week-of-sept-13-2009-in-play-stocks-breakout-results/">options data to filter stocks</a>.
However, it is not automated. So it takes a lot of time to gather and
analyze the data. Furthermore, the set of tools that I use is limited to
U.S. stocks. Now that I have taken an interest in the Canadian stock
market, I can't seem to find any public tool that I like. Thus, I am
biting the bullet now and taking my time to develop a custom system once
and for all. Before we can analyze stock data, we need to extract them
first. Where better else for that than go straight to the source at
TMX.com, the parent company of Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and TSX
Venture Exchange (TSXV). TMX.com provide a list of publicly traded
companies in ten Excel files. The files are divided by sectors. Each
contain a number of fundamental company data, such as market
capitalization and outstanding shares. So step 1 is to extract those
data. This is where I am at now. I attached the source code for an
alpha/developmental release below for anyone interested. It is a working
program to scrape the data from TMX.com's files. But it's still a
work-in-progress. That's why I am calling it a version 0.1. The next
milestone is to program a Stocks class to hold, organize, and manage all
three thousand, six hundred, and sixty companies' data. This is an easy
task to do by extending the built-in dictionary class in Python.
However, I haven't gotten to that chapter yet in my scientific
programming with Python learning book. I stopped at chapter 8 to work on
this project. Chapter 9 is the inheritence and hierarchical material.
The goal of this project is to build an automated data scraping program
for TSX and TSXV data from various sources into my computer. Once I have
my data, that's when the real fun starts. Regarding the code below, I
know that source code is useless for most people. Once the project is
complete, I will compile the code into a standalone application and post
it on this site. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/feed/">Subscribe to my RSS feed</a> so that you can keep

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just spent the last few hours looking into Google App Engine to use it
for trading. Google App Engine (GAE) is a cloud computing development
and hosting platform for web applications. GAE is similar to the
well-known Amazon EC2 service but it is also very different. The main
difference between GAE and EC2 is that GAE is not as flexible as EC2 but
it is a lot easier to develop on. Think of it like using C++ (EC2) to
write your own trading platform to using EasyLanguage on TradeStation or
MQL on Metatrader (GAE). Another advantage for using Google App Engine
is that it is free! Well, to a certain extent. It is free for a limited
monthly usage. However, Google's free quota is known to be very generous
(think Gmail) and this is no exception. Based on the numbers, it looks
comparable to a typical \$20/month virtual private server (VPS) hosting
package. My guess is that you can run a decent personal quant program on
it if you keep the resources for yourself (private use). For more
information on the free quota, you can read the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas.html">current GAE quota</a>
web page or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Engine">Wikipedia page for GAE</a>. You might be wondering how
did I spend a few hours just reading on GAE? The answer is that I've
done a brief research, planning, and assessment to see how GAE can be
put to use in terms of quantitative analysis for automated and
discretionary trading. Without going through all of my notes and logic,
here's the gist of my conclusion.</p>
<h2>For Automated Trading</h2>
<p>Since GAE is also a SDK, it has a restricted programming API. You can't
just plug in any custom library of your own (i.e. your broker's API)
into your program. That is its advantage and its disadvantage.
Furthermore, GAE only support HTTP and HTTPS. So you can't open a socket
for your connection either. These limitations won't be changing anytime
soon as GAE is designed to be like that for security reasons. Basically,
there's no way for your web application on GAE to connect with your
broker for trading. So much for that idea.</p>
<h2>For Discretionary Trading</h2>
<p>Things look brighter for discretionary trading though. A big bonus with
using Google App Engine is that it supports the Google Finance API.
Google Finance offers free real-time stock quotes. Combine it with the
programming capability of the Google App Engine and you have yourself a
free number cruncher in the cloud. However, GAE is definitely no match
for your personal computer, so why would you go through all that
trouble? One possible scenario in which this could be useful is for
traders that is often on the road or traders such as myself in which we
have a day job. In that case, you can set you quant analytics on GAE as
a private web application and then you can access it as a web page
anywhere on your mobile phone. One of the obvious limitation with using
GAE is that it has limited features for scientific computing. For
example, it doesn't support Numpy in the Python SDK. As such, I can't
imagine using GAE for anything more than simple technical analysis for
now. I certainly hope that GAE can include more powerful scientific
computing capabilities in the near future. Until then, I really can't
see Google App Engine offering much help aside from performing
algorithmic tasks to help with your trading analysis. Their open issues
log does announce that <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=190">Numpy is being integrated into GAE</a> though. So
that's a great sign for things to come! I am very hopeful of GAE's
potential as a free cloud server to host my quant analytics on. We'll
just have to wait for now.</p>
