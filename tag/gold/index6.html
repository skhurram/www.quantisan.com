<p>Like the rest of the market, commodity traders have been going through
some wild rides this year. If anything, their ride is significantly more
thrilling because of the leverage.</p>
<p>Of all the commodities, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/gold/">Gold</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/silver/">Silver</a> are my favourites. Even
though I don't trade the futures market anymore, I still keep an eye on
them. Furthermore, I have a vested interest in precious metals because
of my exposure in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">SLW</a>.</p>
<p>As I have noted last month, I am <em>long</em> term <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-gold-and-silver-markets-perspective-october-2008/">bullish on precious
metals</a> like every one else. Heck, I think it's a one in a life time
investment opportunity. <em>In times of crisis, hoard gold.</em> And we are in
as bad a crisis as ever. Investment opportunity doesn't get any more
obvious that this. Yet, the reality is that we are in an obvious down
trend since the price highs in July 15. Coincidentally, we are exactly 4
months after that peak today.</p>
<p>Yesterday's bounce of the market coincided with a reversal in the
precious metal prices too. In fact, whereas today's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">market retraced</a>
a bit, the gold and silver prices continued higher. They are up 39 and
0.736 respectively to 743.50 and 9.54.</p>
<p>I must say, I am not as confident in analyzing commodity prices because
I lack an edge in the futures market. I merely look at the price and the
e-mini volumes. The e-mini's are just a small piece of the global
precious metal market. There are the full-size futures, various
exchanges around the world, the spot market, and what not. Then there's
the non-trivial relation of gold to US\$ exchange rates, since gold is a
world commodity but its price is based in the US dollar... and so on and
so forth.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll make do with what I have.</p>
<p>Looking at the gold and silver prices in the chart, we are still well
within a trading range. Could this be a turning point for them too? I
have no idea.</p>
<p>The way I play the gold and silver prices is simple -- I don't. I just
follow them. Even though we have shot up 70 points in gold, I think it's
too early to say if we're truly on the rise from here yet.</p>
<p>However, not that I'm just rambling here, I do have a point. I think
observing the prices of gold and silver around that marked trendline
around 757 and 10.3 will be the best indication yet. Since the wild
swings of recent prices in gold and silver have been spinning my head, I
think we are approaching a significant breakout.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The fundamental for \$1000+ Gold is certainly in place, like the free
money handout that's been going on in many countries and the global
financial panic. Conventional wisdom says in times of trouble, hoard as
much gold as you can. I still believe Gold and Silver will break their
previous highs from earlier this year.</p>
<p>Yet, I don't have a Swiss bank account to hoard physical gold nor have I
got the financial means to even purchase <a href="http://www.pmcg.com.au/">mint-backed gold
certificates</a>. I am merely a small time trader on the market. One rule
of the tradebook I learned by experience is that it's good to <strong>live by
an independent perspective on the market, but don't die by it</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at the gold and silver charts though, it is blatantly obvious
that we're in a severe downtrend lately, for whatever reasons. The small
rally this week may be tempting for some perma-bull or the
fundamentalists. But I wouldn't enter the commodities market at this
point without some price-volume confirmation.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we look at the gold chart. We see that the current rally is
probably a retracement. It has tested its resistance at 780 and backed
down already.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_537" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>Surprisingly, the silver camp is looking better. We are seeing a
positive divergence in both the RSI and MACD in the latest down leg.
This is caused by the more severe fall of silver since its high earlier.
The silver down leg hasn't had a chance to catch a breath like gold has.
In fact, I would watch for an upside break in Silver regardless of the
move in Gold. I don't know would this be possible and sustainable,
silver going up while gold going down.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's easy to forget that gold and silver are two commodities
with two different prices. That is because gold and silver price
correlation is very high and have generally moved together for many
fundamental reasons. However, there are periods of time when the
Gold/Silver ratio make drastic changes.</p>
<p>The G/S ratio has been around 55 - 65 in the past 5 years. G/S ratio
runs higher in times of trouble when people purchase gold as a safety
shelter to store value. In the tech bubble, G/S went above 80 around
2003. The highest in the past 40 year occured after the 1987 crash, in
1990 when G/S got to 100.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_539" align="aligncenter" width="500"

www.gold-eagle.com)"][<img alt="Historical Gold/Silver Ratio" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/gsr-gm.gif" title="gsr-gm" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>While the absolute price of Gold and Silver has been counter-intuitive,
the G/S ratio picture still fits well with the norm. Notice the spike
starting in August 2008? When the financial troubles we're in now is
written all over the wall? (Actually, the writing on the wall appeared
late last year already, but that's another story.) The faster fall of
Silver lately could be explained with this. If that's the case, then
both Gold and Silver could continue its downtrend.</p>

ratio" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/gold-silver.png" title="gold-silver" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>So what's my point in this post? I don't really have one. I am just
saying what's in my mind about Gold and Silver in this recent
counter-intuitive trend. In terms of the prices, I am still bullish on
gold and silver in the looong term. And definitely bearish in the short
term. When will they move up? I don't know, just observe the market. But
I see silver to have more upside if it were to go up. It could easily
creep up to \$12 from here.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>While I haven't written about my stance on the flood of bailouts, I have
been against it all along. Pouring tax payers' <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122540927284586151.html">money into a select few
elites</a> in the name of <em>helping</em> the economy has sank my respect for
the American government to a new low. This is just like the Bush's
Weapons of Mass Destruction lies and the subsequent Iraq invasion all
over again, only on an epic scale and the effect much more encompassing.
However, the situation have reached a new low. In today's news, there's
talk of banks asking for credit card debt forgiveness. They might as
well just hand out each American a million dollar cheque. Then watch the
American dollar become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar">Zimbobwe money</a> and plunge America back to the
Medieval era when people would barter for their goods. The sheer
stupidity of this move is below even that of Bush's intelligence! If
what the U.S.A. is doing lately isn't socialism, then I don't know what
is. That is one huge factor why I've been long gold and silver with my
accumulating position in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">SLW</a>. It looks as though we might be in for
a continued downtrend in precious metal prices. But sooner or later,
prices will reflect their true values. Update: The Big Picture made a
post about <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/10/moral-hazard-of.html">mortgage bailouts</a> today on the same issue. Barry puts the
issue of bailing out bad debts succinctly, "moral hazard not only
encourages recklessness, it leads to people looking to avoid
responsibility for bad decisions."</p> </div>

<p>I actually had to double check my quote when I saw YG was up
80-something yesterday. Unbelievable! The move was attributed to the
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122165238916347677.html?mod=article-outset-box">Fed's take over of AIG with \$85 billion for 80% of shares</a></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if Gold can break \$900 and hold it above
that resistance. Otherwise, we'll probably go into a trading range
around \$800 - \$900 until Oil breaks \$100 too.</p>
