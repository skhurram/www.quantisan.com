            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R45cF_Y4uoI/AAAAAAAAAG0/mSL5Cg4L4_w/s400/gold_day.jpg" />][] My short on gold last night was a good call. Gold today is
below \$880. After losing a bunch on the Dow, I entered another short
position on Gold at \$882.60 out of frustration. In my mind I thought
that was a short term top from retracement. In hindsight, it was a bad
spot to go short. The indicators were in the middle and price was
inching up. It's at \$887.20 at the moment. This emotional trade could
cost me dearly. I'll see how it turns out tomorrow.</p>
<p>Update: I entered 2 more shorts at \$880.50 when the retracement seemed
weak from the indicators. I now have a total of 4 shorts on YM! I am
taking a lot of risk here because with 4 contracts, each 10 point drop
would amount to \$1300! However, I strongly believe we are at a short
term top in Gold.</p>
<p>While people are still hoping this is just a minor correction before
newer highs, the bearish signals in the daily chart are just too clear
to not plunge in.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R46FNvY4urI/AAAAAAAAAHM/Zu0vdgpeJcU/s400/gold_daily.jpg" />][]Notice the volume of the last two down days. They are near
their high as in the November correction. MACD is also turning down from
a fierce run. Stochastic is below signal line and actually crossing 80
as of today. If I might say this again, what really got me is the high
volumes in the last two trading days.</p>
<p>The combinations of these signals, alone with the current position of
the price high above the Keltner channel, has always produced
significant falls in the past year. This time, the volume is ALSO
confirmation the signal. So my guess is that this will be a big
correction to come. Probably to \$800 or even below.</p>
<p>My 4 stops are set to just above intraday highs and pivot points. If
they all hit, I'll lose about \$1500. If this plays out, short term
price should be at least back down to 20 MA level (which is also the
triangle top) at \$850. My average price is \$885.1. So a potential
profit of about \$4500. Thus, reward/risk = \$4500 / \$1500 = 3. Which
is pretty good. That's why I convinced myself to take on so many
positions.</p>
<p>Anyway, tomorrow should be a telling day as it's the 3rd day since the
initial drop. We'll see if the price recover.</p>

and then lost like \$28 points in 7 hours. Daily chart shows two tail
from past two days. Volume is also a higher today on a lower close.
Stochastic and MACD looks to be turning down.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could have waited til the morning to enter the position. The
60 min. chart shows the price is going up. So I could get a better
price. I'll wait this out and not watch the price so often since this is
suppose to be a long term trade. Target price is \$865, previous
consolidation. I'll add another position if it plays out well. We'll see
tomorrow. CPI is coming out in the morning.</p>

closed at \$897.20. The million dollar question is, with it go up or
down. This is very exciting indeed. If it goes up, \$930 seems likely to
be the target. If it breaks down though, it could launch back to \$750
(triangle low) or \$650 (flag) level. It's funny that watching the price
alone, you can see that everyone's waiting to see which way gold is
heading. The price is just hovering below \$900. Once it breaks either
way, all hell's going to break lose. I almost pulled my trigger before
the close and BET on gold going down because of lower volume, the run up
was too fast, and the low season (summer) for gold is imminent (Feb -
Aug are usually lower). It would have been a big gamble as we're heading
into the weekend so there's going to be a big gap. A lot can happen. In
the end, I didn't short gold because it's a low probability trade. It
was outright gamble.</p>
<p>Here's a picture I grabbed from <a href="http://www.goldbriefing.com/">Goldbriefing</a>, showing the flag and
triangle nicely.</p>

experience while I develop my auto system. The market I've chosen is YM
(mini Dow) for the short term, ZG (CBOT Gold) for the longer term, and
Corn for the long long term.</p>
<p>YM is on CBOT, so I wouldn't have to shell out another \$55 for the
NYMEX data. It's also a more popular/mature market than ER2 so I can
obtain fundamental analysis easier to complement my technical analysis.
The recent price action is also very predictable.</p>
<p>For example, the marked spot on the left graph is a potential strategy.
Notice the breakdown of the TRIX corresponds with an imminent breakdown
of the price. This is just one example. But observing price pattern and
TRIX pattern seems to be useful.</p>
<p>For my other two choices.</p>
<p>Gold is hot at the moment, so there could be huge swings. It's now
around \$890 and I'm expecting a correction based on the fundamentals.
I'll watch the price pattern and indicators to time my entry.</p>
<p>Corn is on a run for the past 3 months. It has low margin requirement
(\~\$1000) and the price are quite consistent. So waiting for
breakout/down can riding the trend could be a long term profitable
trade.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The average daily volume of ZG seems to be about 20,000 contracts. Given
about 21 hours of trading per day. 20000 contracts / 1260 minutes \~= 15
contracts / minute. So using a minimum of 100 contracts / bar chart
seems reasonable. A 200 to 300 contracts bar seem to be a good starting
point on first glimpse.</p>
<p>The key is to maintain reaction time of the system while not
overtrading. I prefer to catch the big wave and not worry about the dips
and spikes too much. Ideal holding period is in hours and not minutes.</p> </div>
