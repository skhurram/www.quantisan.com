dollar. Recession is off and inflation is back in town. So gold is on
the run again. (i.e. recession lower demand of gold, inflation raises
value) I immediately took action and closed all my short positions at
\$869.50</p>
<p>Gold price went rocketed today and closed at \$890.60 So now my gold run
is off, even worst, I missed a big opportunity.</p>
<p>When I was certain that gold price would rise, I correctly covered my
short. However, I should have changed side and WENT LONG on it! I still
need to develop this <span style="font-weight:bold;">flip flopping
mentality</span> if I were to improve on my trading. I missed out only
an easy \$20 jump on Gold today because I didn't go long after closing
the short even though I knew for certain the price would increase.</p>
<p>Lesson of the day: <span style="font-weight:bold;">A bad short is a good
long.</span></p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5EWDvY4uyI/AAAAAAAAAIE/xYQcA2QZuo8/s400/gold.jpg" />][] Gold doesn't seem to be falling much like a correction would.
The current price is inching lower instead of falling as it should based
on the MACD and Stochastic bearish signals are disappointing. It's just
going sideways. So I'm wondering would this be just a brief
consolidation before it rises to new highs again? This uncertainty is
definitely why the price is going sideways at the moment.</p>
<p>Price is about \$885 at the moment. It would have been better if I only
had my 2 positions from above \$886. But I entered 2 more shorts at
\$880.10 in fear of missing the train. That was definitely a mistake
because it hugely increased my risk. I pretty much got in at the bottom
of the current trading range. I could have entered easily at \$886 from
the bounce when the indicators were right.</p>
<p>Last night, price of gold dropped to \$870.80 and I had over \$1000 of
paper profit. But it was short lived.</p>
<p>I won't cover on panic at the moment. I might cover the 2 extra shorts
on the next bump. Just so I can makeup for my greedy mistake and lower
my risk exposure in this uncertain situation.</p>
<p>However, after dropping for 3 days in a row, today's higher close is
expected. Next week should be more telling.</p>

below \$880. After losing a bunch on the Dow, I entered another short
position on Gold at \$882.60 out of frustration. In my mind I thought
that was a short term top from retracement. In hindsight, it was a bad
spot to go short. The indicators were in the middle and price was
inching up. It's at \$887.20 at the moment. This emotional trade could
cost me dearly. I'll see how it turns out tomorrow.</p>
<p>Update: I entered 2 more shorts at \$880.50 when the retracement seemed
weak from the indicators. I now have a total of 4 shorts on YM! I am
taking a lot of risk here because with 4 contracts, each 10 point drop
would amount to \$1300! However, I strongly believe we are at a short
term top in Gold.</p>
<p>While people are still hoping this is just a minor correction before
newer highs, the bearish signals in the daily chart are just too clear
to not plunge in.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R46FNvY4urI/AAAAAAAAAHM/Zu0vdgpeJcU/s400/gold_daily.jpg" />][]Notice the volume of the last two down days. They are near
their high as in the November correction. MACD is also turning down from
a fierce run. Stochastic is below signal line and actually crossing 80
as of today. If I might say this again, what really got me is the high
volumes in the last two trading days.</p>
<p>The combinations of these signals, alone with the current position of
the price high above the Keltner channel, has always produced
significant falls in the past year. This time, the volume is ALSO
confirmation the signal. So my guess is that this will be a big
correction to come. Probably to \$800 or even below.</p>
<p>My 4 stops are set to just above intraday highs and pivot points. If
they all hit, I'll lose about \$1500. If this plays out, short term
price should be at least back down to 20 MA level (which is also the
triangle top) at \$850. My average price is \$885.1. So a potential
profit of about \$4500. Thus, reward/risk = \$4500 / \$1500 = 3. Which
is pretty good. That's why I convinced myself to take on so many
positions.</p>
<p>Anyway, tomorrow should be a telling day as it's the 3rd day since the
initial drop. We'll see if the price recover.</p>

and then lost like \$28 points in 7 hours. Daily chart shows two tail
from past two days. Volume is also a higher today on a lower close.
Stochastic and MACD looks to be turning down.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could have waited til the morning to enter the position. The
60 min. chart shows the price is going up. So I could get a better
price. I'll wait this out and not watch the price so often since this is
suppose to be a long term trade. Target price is \$865, previous
consolidation. I'll add another position if it plays out well. We'll see
tomorrow. CPI is coming out in the morning.</p>
