            <div class="article-content"> <p>Friday's strong rally with some volume seem to be following through as
of this morning. However, last Friday was options expiration day. So a
good proportion of that volume is expected to be due to that.
Additionally, the Asian market was down, except Japan and Australia,
last night. This is not a good sign. Hong Kong (-1.59%), Shanghai
(-3.67%), and Japan (+2.70%). This isn't good because it shows the world
players are not putting in their vote of confidence in this rally.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the hourly e-mini S&amp;P500 still haven't broken its downtrend
resistance from 11/04. I would like to see it breaks 814 and remain
above 803 as a confirmation to this rally. If ES can break 814/820, then
840 is just an earshot away and would be my first target. If it breaks
below 803, then 790 is the first target and then further breaking 780
would be diastrous.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_872" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>On a positive note, the US Dollar Index finally broke 87.50 as I was
waiting last Friday. This is a short term support level and a downtrend
in US Dollar is a good sign for the rally. This suggest that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/pre-market-analysis-for-november-21-2008/">sideline
money are moving into the US market</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, precious metals remain the best performers since last week. Gold
is still moving up with good momentum. ZG is now up 24.50 overnight to
816.20. The major 800 resistance didn't held it for long. If we can stay
above this 800 level, then this is a great sign of the strength to come
for Gold. Otherwise, breaking 800 to 793 or so is expected as a
retracement. Just so as long as Gold doesn't break 780, this precious
metals rally is still good.</p>

<p>Option expiration Friday is finally here! After <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1320/">yesterday's horrific
day</a>, everyone is expecting a reversal today. Indeed, the market
futures are up overnight. S&amp;P futures broke 780 overnight and is holding
at around 765. We are probably going to open with a gap up in the market
and make an intraday rally from there. However, I wouldn't be chasing
this rally just yet. As you can see from Figure 1, we are merely
retracing the recent plunge back to the downtrend from earlier in the
week. S&amp;P 500 at 780 will be a resistance for today. 750 will be its
support. At 765, notice that we have 15 more upside points versus 15
down. This is not a good risk/reward at all.</p>
<p>Based on the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/stock-move-estimation-expiration-day-based-on-option-prices/">option pricing estimation method</a>, the S&amp;P is expected
to move within 40 points today.</p>
<p>One indicator to watch for a rally with follow through is the US Dollar
Index. As <a href="http://www.billcara.com">Bill</a> opined (yes, I read his blog religiously), \$USD will
fall if the sideline money are moving into equity. That will be the
source of a good rally. From Figure 2 below, you can see that the US
Dollar Index has dropped a bit. Yet, it is holding on at the 200 hour
bar moving average and a minor support from the recent trend. I would
like to see it breaks below 87.5 and stays there for at least an hour
before proclaiming a hold-able rally.</p>

<p>Another item of note is the rise of the precious metals. Gold has broken
the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-out-of-a-month-long-trading-range-for-gold-and-silver/">month-long triangle</a> to the upside. That's a good sign. Figure 4
shows that it has broken its hourly resistance too. We'll see if gold
can hold that gain or would this be a fake breakout of the triangle.</p>
<p>I am leaning towards nibbling at the market today on the long side with
small positions. If we see confirmation, then add slowly to the bullish
positions.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the market, commodity traders have been going through
some wild rides this year. If anything, their ride is significantly more
thrilling because of the leverage.</p>
<p>Of all the commodities, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/gold/">Gold</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/silver/">Silver</a> are my favourites. Even
though I don't trade the futures market anymore, I still keep an eye on
them. Furthermore, I have a vested interest in precious metals because
of my exposure in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">SLW</a>.</p>
<p>As I have noted last month, I am <em>long</em> term <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-gold-and-silver-markets-perspective-october-2008/">bullish on precious
metals</a> like every one else. Heck, I think it's a one in a life time
investment opportunity. <em>In times of crisis, hoard gold.</em> And we are in
as bad a crisis as ever. Investment opportunity doesn't get any more
obvious that this. Yet, the reality is that we are in an obvious down
trend since the price highs in July 15. Coincidentally, we are exactly 4
months after that peak today.</p>
<p>Yesterday's bounce of the market coincided with a reversal in the
precious metal prices too. In fact, whereas today's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">market retraced</a>
a bit, the gold and silver prices continued higher. They are up 39 and
0.736 respectively to 743.50 and 9.54.</p>
<p>I must say, I am not as confident in analyzing commodity prices because
I lack an edge in the futures market. I merely look at the price and the
e-mini volumes. The e-mini's are just a small piece of the global
precious metal market. There are the full-size futures, various
exchanges around the world, the spot market, and what not. Then there's
the non-trivial relation of gold to US\$ exchange rates, since gold is a
world commodity but its price is based in the US dollar... and so on and
so forth.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll make do with what I have.</p>
<p>Looking at the gold and silver prices in the chart, we are still well
within a trading range. Could this be a turning point for them too? I
have no idea.</p>
<p>The way I play the gold and silver prices is simple -- I don't. I just
follow them. Even though we have shot up 70 points in gold, I think it's
too early to say if we're truly on the rise from here yet.</p>
<p>However, not that I'm just rambling here, I do have a point. I think
observing the prices of gold and silver around that marked trendline
around 757 and 10.3 will be the best indication yet. Since the wild
swings of recent prices in gold and silver have been spinning my head, I
think we are approaching a significant breakout.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The fundamental for \$1000+ Gold is certainly in place, like the free
money handout that's been going on in many countries and the global
financial panic. Conventional wisdom says in times of trouble, hoard as
much gold as you can. I still believe Gold and Silver will break their
previous highs from earlier this year.</p>
<p>Yet, I don't have a Swiss bank account to hoard physical gold nor have I
got the financial means to even purchase <a href="http://www.pmcg.com.au/">mint-backed gold
certificates</a>. I am merely a small time trader on the market. One rule
of the tradebook I learned by experience is that it's good to <strong>live by
an independent perspective on the market, but don't die by it</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at the gold and silver charts though, it is blatantly obvious
that we're in a severe downtrend lately, for whatever reasons. The small
rally this week may be tempting for some perma-bull or the
fundamentalists. But I wouldn't enter the commodities market at this
point without some price-volume confirmation.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we look at the gold chart. We see that the current rally is
probably a retracement. It has tested its resistance at 780 and backed
down already.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_537" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>Surprisingly, the silver camp is looking better. We are seeing a
positive divergence in both the RSI and MACD in the latest down leg.
This is caused by the more severe fall of silver since its high earlier.
The silver down leg hasn't had a chance to catch a breath like gold has.
In fact, I would watch for an upside break in Silver regardless of the
move in Gold. I don't know would this be possible and sustainable,
silver going up while gold going down.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_538" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>Sometimes it's easy to forget that gold and silver are two commodities
with two different prices. That is because gold and silver price
correlation is very high and have generally moved together for many
fundamental reasons. However, there are periods of time when the
Gold/Silver ratio make drastic changes.</p>
<p>The G/S ratio has been around 55 - 65 in the past 5 years. G/S ratio
runs higher in times of trouble when people purchase gold as a safety
shelter to store value. In the tech bubble, G/S went above 80 around
2003. The highest in the past 40 year occured after the 1987 crash, in
1990 when G/S got to 100.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_539" align="aligncenter" width="500"

www.gold-eagle.com)"][<img alt="Historical Gold/Silver Ratio" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/gsr-gm.gif" title="gsr-gm" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>While the absolute price of Gold and Silver has been counter-intuitive,
the G/S ratio picture still fits well with the norm. Notice the spike
starting in August 2008? When the financial troubles we're in now is
written all over the wall? (Actually, the writing on the wall appeared
late last year already, but that's another story.) The faster fall of
Silver lately could be explained with this. If that's the case, then
both Gold and Silver could continue its downtrend.</p>

ratio" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/gold-silver.png" title="gold-silver" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>So what's my point in this post? I don't really have one. I am just
saying what's in my mind about Gold and Silver in this recent
counter-intuitive trend. In terms of the prices, I am still bullish on
gold and silver in the looong term. And definitely bearish in the short
term. When will they move up? I don't know, just observe the market. But
I see silver to have more upside if it were to go up. It could easily
creep up to \$12 from here.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>While I haven't written about my stance on the flood of bailouts, I have
been against it all along. Pouring tax payers' <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122540927284586151.html">money into a select few
elites</a> in the name of <em>helping</em> the economy has sank my respect for
the American government to a new low. This is just like the Bush's
Weapons of Mass Destruction lies and the subsequent Iraq invasion all
over again, only on an epic scale and the effect much more encompassing.
However, the situation have reached a new low. In today's news, there's
talk of banks asking for credit card debt forgiveness. They might as
well just hand out each American a million dollar cheque. Then watch the
American dollar become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar">Zimbobwe money</a> and plunge America back to the
Medieval era when people would barter for their goods. The sheer
stupidity of this move is below even that of Bush's intelligence! If
what the U.S.A. is doing lately isn't socialism, then I don't know what
is. That is one huge factor why I've been long gold and silver with my
accumulating position in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">SLW</a>. It looks as though we might be in for
a continued downtrend in precious metal prices. But sooner or later,
prices will reflect their true values. Update: The Big Picture made a
post about <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/10/moral-hazard-of.html">mortgage bailouts</a> today on the same issue. Barry puts the
issue of bailing out bad debts succinctly, "moral hazard not only
encourages recklessness, it leads to people looking to avoid
responsibility for bad decisions."</p> </div>

<p>I actually had to double check my quote when I saw YG was up
80-something yesterday. Unbelievable! The move was attributed to the
[Fed's take over of AIG with \$85 billion for 80% of shares][]</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if Gold can break \$900 and hold it above
that resistance. Otherwise, we'll probably go into a trading range
around \$800 - \$900 until Oil breaks \$100 too.</p>
