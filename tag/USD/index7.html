Fibonacci level and a support of the current uptrend, see Figure 1. This

0.7170 Reward / Risk = 130 / 55 = 2.4 \&lt; 3 ... The R/R is kinda low. So
I've changed it to a 1/3 position instead of 2/3. Now, let's just wait
and see if USD can continue going up.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>USD/CHF is chalking a wide V pattern now. The up-leg has played out
nicely for 2/3 of the way. According to T-theory, USD/CHF should reach
1.045 on Monday. Furthermore, USD/CHF is testing support at the top fin
of the Fibonacci fan line as seen in Figure 1. 1.034 is also a short
term support by an up-trending line, see Figures 1 and 2. Lastly, the
current trend is up as shown by my 2-MA lines in Figure 1. In summary,
both short and intermediate trends are aligned and we're at support now,
thus, I bought when the reward/risk is favourable. Entry: 1.03498 Stop:
1.03240 Target: 1.0450 Reward / Risk = 100.2 pips / 25.8 pips = 3.9 I
initially placed my stop at 1.0295 but realized the reward/risk was
horrible. So I moved my stop up to make this a shorter timeframe play
(i.e. a quick reflex bounce). On another note, the order types at
<a href="http://www.oanda.com/">Oanda</a> (my forex broker) is severely handicapped. It only has the
basics. For example, I would have liked an order-cancel-order type so
that I can place a contingent exit at the profit target and the stop.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I went long USD/CAD this morning with 1/3 position when we bounced back
up to 1.0800 and then retraced to 1.075. It was stopped out about an
hour and a half later. In hindsight, this was not a good trade for one
major reason. <strong>I should not have gone against the short-term trend on a
weak support level even if the intermediate trend is on my back</strong>. I
should have at least waited for stronger support around 1.0650. Figure 1
is a chart of the 15-min USD/CAD with my orders marked. When USD/CAD
failed to break 1.0800, a major resistance, it was a sign that the short
term trend remains bearish. At least I entered a stop and didn't let the
loss accumulate. Below are the statistics for this trade. On another
note, my stink bid placed at 1.0666 this morning seems likely to be
triggered (USD/CAD is trading at 1.0679 as of this moment of writing).
My stop for that is 1.0600. This is a better entry because there's a
multi-day resistance at 1.0600 and crude is testing a significant \$70
resistance too. Although if I'm more conservative, I should be more
patient and wait for 1.0600 instead... So I'm only entering 1/3 position
for this instead of the 2/3 as in my strategy (revised since my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdcad-all-out-1-0872-196-6-pips-and-1-0821-145-6-pips/">last
paper trade in USD/CAD</a>). See Figure 2 for the support/resistance.
<strong>Update:</strong> I retracted my bid at 1.0666 because crude oil broke above
\$70 and USD/CAD hang on to 1.0672 or so for a few hours. If we do break
it, it would only create another short-term sell-off. So there's no
point in me having an entry just 6 pips below at 1.0666. It will just
get washed down when the support breaks. Entry: 1.07426, 3000 units
Stopped out: 1.06999, 3000 units Net: -\$12.81 Time held: 1:28:00 Max.

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>USD/CAD made a quick run to 1.10 and retraced back down to 1.08. Since
my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-usdcad-1-06754/">entry at 1.06754 almost two weeks ago</a>, there's been both
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-failing-to-break-above-a-short-term-downtrend/">run-down</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/us-dollar-vs-canadian-broke-above-resistance-after-fomc-and-before-g20/">run-up</a> as I have noted. Although this trade turned
out well with an average paper gain of 171.1 pips (see stats below), one
thing that I'd definitely need to work on is not giving back the profit.
For the first half of my position, USD/CAD topped at 1.0948 and I
existed at 1.0872, which is 0.71% of unrealized profit left on the
table. For the second half, USD/CAD topped at 1.0992 and I exited at
1.0821, which is a dismal 1.6% left on the table. I could have doubled
my gain if I can take my chips off the table at a better time.
Obviously, I still need a lot of work to do in sharpening my stops. For
that, I started to keep track of my trades using a detailed spreadsheet
that have custom macros to calculate my performance statistics. Some of
these numbers are displayed below. I will now focus on the <em>quality</em> of
a trade rather than just on the net outcome of a trade while I'm working
on improving my trading. I'll cover this topic another time once the
spreadsheet is done. I am still tweaking the formulas and format as I
record more trades in it. Entry: 1.06754, 5000 units Exit 1: 1.0872,

good number) % from Max. Gain: <strong>0.71%</strong> and <strong>1.60%</strong> (not so good
numbers)</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>In one fell-swoop, USD/CAD gained about 200 pips in mere minutes today
(Figure 1) after the <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/Federal_Reserve">FOMC</a> meeting. With the <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/G-20">G20</a> meeting going on
this weekend, there's going to be some expected volatility. However, a
bright spot in this is that USD/CAD has broken above a trendline as
shown in Figure 2. This is a very bullish sign in the intermediate term
as I have conjectured that we're still in a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-usdcad-1-06754/">long term uptrend for
USD/CAD</a>. While the resistance has moved from the initial point of
1.113 down to 1.086 because of the descending trendline, I will not be
moving my point of ease-in for the other 50% position. We simply have
too much resistance in the near-term between 1.09 and 1.11 to be adding
at this point. I am happy <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-usdcad-1-06754/">holding a 50% position</a>. I will only add the other 50% when the up trend is clear in
both short and long terms. Which isn't the case for the short term as
we're obviously <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-failing-to-break-above-a-short-term-downtrend/">in a trading range between 1.0700 and 1.1100</a> for now
as shown in Figure 1. Thus, to minimize my risk, I'm split up my stop
into two and moved them up. 50% of current position below the support at
1.0872 and the rest at 1.0800. For next week, I will consider adding 25%
if we can stay above this long term trendline at 1.0860 (round up to
1.0900). In summary, here's an update of my plan. Entry: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-usdcad-1-06754/">1.06754</a>, 50% position from last week. Stop 1: 1.0872,
to book half the profit on this quick run up. Stop 2: 1.0800, in case it
turns ugly this weekend. Target: 1.15, unchanged from Figure 2. <strong>Update
Sept 25:</strong> USD/CAD retraced to 1.0868 overnight and then continued it's
ascend to 1.0976 as of this writing. My stop 1 was triggered at 1.0872
(+197 pips). I still have half the units left. I have moved my last stop
up to 1.0821 for the weekend. Hopefully it will hold and then I can look
to add more next week after the G20 meeting.</p>

USD/CAD touched 1.0845 yesterday and dived back down. It is trading at
just below 1.0690 now. I moved my stop higher to 1.0648 yesterday as
USD/CAD broke above the short term trendline (Figure 1). There's not
many pips separating the price and my stop, so there's a good chance
that my stop will get gunned down. As can be seen from Figure 1, the
resistance is at 1.0770 and support is at a recent low of 1.0585. The
current trend is also pointing downward.</p>
