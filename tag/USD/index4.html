            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-change-of-wind-for-australian-dollar-shorted-audusd-0-9183-and-audcad-0-9546/">AUD/USD short from yesterday</a> played out exactly as I planned. But
I took profit a few pips earlier than I wanted because the bounce from
0.9025 fooled me. As you can see from Figure 1, AUD/USD is resting on
0.9000 support as I predicted. Now the million dollar question is,
should I go long in this currency pair because of the super long term
trend as I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-change-of-wind-for-australian-dollar-shorted-audusd-0-9183-and-audcad-0-9546/">discussed in my previous post</a>? That brown support line in which AUD/USD is resting on now
(Fig. 1) extends all the way back to April 2008. However, there's also a
nearby support at <a href="http://www.tradergav.com/2010/01/22/is-it-time-now-audusd-is-in-the-zone/">0.8945 as shown on Gav's Trading Blog</a>. Since I
don't trade such a long term timeframe, I will be more conservative on
this by watching how the price reacts in the short term at this 0.9000
level. Gold also broke below 1100 but is holding above its own support
around 1080-1090 too. Both markets are finding support at current
prices. Let's see how well they last. I am flat in this pair until
things are more clear to me. On another note, this isn't exactly a
victory as I've been trying to short the Aussie for days. You would have
been better flipping a coin in comparison to my success rate lately.
I've lost more than I have gained on this move so far. In fact, I am
still on handicap mode (half position size) as I'm <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/work-harder-trade-fewer-in-a-long-and-excruciating-trading-drawdown/">still in a 3%
drawdown</a> as shown in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trading log</a>. However, I am slowly
crawling my way out with limited risk and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade">profitable trades</a> such as
this.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been barking up the short-Aussie-tree since the beginning of the
year. See post [#1][], [#2][] on AUDJPY, and [#3][], [#4][] on
AUDCAD for the long term analysis. (Also see my post on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/early-bird-does-not-get-the-worm-in-forex-trading/">being early
shorting the Aussie</a>.) Anyway, now that AUDUSD has backed off the 9300
level with a bang, it seems that the trend reversal in the Aussie is
getting clearer. Why do I say that? Notice the sequence of recent AUDUSD
price action depicted in the daily chart of Figure 1.</p>
<ol>
<li>Breaking below lower long term trendline (thick brown line, Fig. 1)
    on Dec 14 followed by a 300 pips down move</li>
<li>Reversing on Dec 22 at 8730 price level, right on the last long term
    support line</li>
<li>Testing the same trendline in #1 from below and gliding along it
    since the new year</li>
<li>Bouncing off the previous resistance at 0.9330</li>
<li>A rapid breakdown right to the neckline support at 0.9100</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, the breakdown of gold price (Fig. 2) is helping to keep the
downward momentum in this currency pair. Now that recent moves are
confirming my long term Aussie short outlook as discussed previously
([#1][], [#2][], [#3][], [#4][]), my plan is to stay on the short
for the long haul. My target on this dive for the AUDUSD is down to
0.9000 corresponding to the long term support line of #2 in that list
above. Of course, prices don't go one way. So remember to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">manage
risks</a> and be prepared for some probable counter-trend moves. [caption

see that I've converted from shorting AUDJPY to shorting AUDUSD. The
simple reason is that USDJPY looks to have bottomed out and is on a run
upward. Thus, the US dollar has more potential strength than the yen to
go long. Lastly, as the title says, I also shorted AUDCAD at 0.9546 for
the long term. See Figure 3. That short is playing out nicely as well
with an [amazing long term bearish setup][#3]. [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>CAD/JPY failed a major resistance level at 90 and has edged out an
obvious intermediate-term downtrend (Fig 1). USD/CAD is also bouncing
off a major support at 1.0200 (Fig. 2). And crude oil is below \$80 on a
slippery slope. As such, shorting loonie seems like a good move at the
moment according to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC trading setup</a>. Yet, here is why I am
opting to short CAD/JPY and not long the more popular USD/CAD currency
pair. Figure 3 shows a 5-year, weekly chart of CAD/JPY (top) and USD/CAD
(bottom). Evidently, the exchange rate of CAD/JPY is still in a
depressed mode since the fall of September 2008. It's also clear on this
chart that why I say 90 is a major resistance level. Beside from being a
nice round number, CAD/JPY has failed to break above 90 twice since
August 2009. As for USD/CAD, the picture isn't as clear. 1.0200 is
definitely a very strong support because it marks the top of a 6-month
range in the first half of 2008. Yet, the downward slope in the long
term since 2005 is not to be ignored. As such, I do not dare to bet on a
bounce on this pair at this price. Moreover, the intermediate-term move
on both of these pair is giving us a confirmation. CAD/JPY is now
testing a falling trendling (Fig. 1). Whereas USD/CAD is testing a
falling support. Thus, I am shorting CAD/JPY under pressure. Going long
on USD/CAD now would be like betting it to bounce on a slippery slope.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I had my best day-trading day this quarter on November 27. I made 95
pips in two hours at the open with only two trades. This post is a
review of my trades that day for my future reference. To save you and
myself from reading, the two reasons for this good run are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convergence of intermediate term signals with day trading signals</li>
<li>Ignoring my bearish sentiment (Dubai news) and traded what I saw
    from the prices</li>
</ol>
<p>Before moving on, let's start by setting the stage with some background
information to summarize what conditions were like that day.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The news on November 25 after NY close of <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-and-yen-buoyed-by-safe-haven-flows-2009-11-27">Dubai World delaying their
debt repayments</a> sent the dollar and yen soaring. I made <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/audjpy-short-81-3777-17-anatomy-of-my-first-400-pips-trade/">my first
400+ pips trade</a> by being at the right place and time on this panic
wave. The U.S. market was closed that day but FTSE sold off more than 3%
the day after the news. So the expectation was for US to do a catch-up
sell off when it opens again on Friday 27th. Risk aversion (equities
down, yen and dollar up) was the talk of the day. Figure 1 below shows
the charts of ES futures (e-mini S&amp;P500). Left is a 1-min. from midnight
of 27th to that morning's NYSE opening. Right is an hourly showing the
move overnight from 26th to 27th.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="ES Futures
(e-mini S&amp;P 500)"][<img alt="ES Futures (e-mini S&amp;P 500)" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-29-ES.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-29-ES.png">ES Futures (e-mini
S&amp;P 500)</a>[/caption]</p>
<h3>Intermediate term signal</h3>
<p>Figure 2 shows my intermediate term signal. EURUSD has been printing an
uptrend on the daily (not shown). Figure 2 shows that EURUSD was testing
the bottom of my channel so I should consider going long. Notice that
this is the same channel that called for the 1.5150 top on 25th. At
least it has proven itself useful once.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURUSD,
3-hour"][<img alt="EURUSD, 3-hour" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_3h.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_3h.png">EURUSD, 3-hour</a>[/caption]</p>
<h3>Short term signals</h3>
<p>For the short term signal, we need to go back to Figure 1 for the ES
charts. ES tanked 40 points over the holiday with very low volume. It
made it all the way to 1067 just before 3am on 27th. Then it lifted all
the way to 1080 at 9am. 1080 is the line in the sand for the bulls and
bears. So retracing all the way to that level before opening is
significant. This pre-open strength in ES was the sign of oversold for
me. This is the short-term confirmation I needed. I entered my first
position to long EURUSD @ 9:09 am to test the water. Then I watched both
EURUSD and ES closely for the next half hour. Once NYSE opened. I
noticed that the TICK was relatively mellow with readings around -250 to
-500. It's unusually good for a -20 points open drop on S&amp;P 500. One
would expect at least -800 readings for a strong negative sentiment. So
after watching EURUSD, ES, and TICK for about 10 minutes, I entered a
second position on a weak retracement at 9:39 am.</p>
<h3>The exits</h3>
<p>For my exit, I took profit at 1.5180 because it's the 50% Fibonacci
level and it's also the top of another of my channel (Figures 2 and 3).
After about 10 minutes of watching the 1M bars, EURUSD failed to clear
that resistance, so I took profit on the second half to go flat in this
pair just before 11 am because it's an early-closing Friday (NYSE
closing at 1pm). The gains were +95 and +93 pips for +0.27% and +0.28%
in my demo account total. Not bad for holding for 2 hours. Update:
Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jlcnuke">Jeff on Twitter</a> for the question. I updated Figure 3 with
the Fib. levels and showed the top and bottom used to draw it.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURUSD, 30
min."][<img alt="EURUSD, 30 min." src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_30min.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-27-EURUSD_30min.png">EURUSD, 30 min.</a>[/caption]</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In summary, I started with an intermediate term setup that aligns with
the major trend. I observed the reaction of the markets on an important
news. Identified an oversold condition from the short-term charts for a
short-term positive divergence signal. Scaled in a position. Then added
more with another confirmation. I scaled out when the target was hit.</p>
<h3>Recommendation</h3>
<p>Once again, I could have been more aggressive on this trade. As shown in
Figure 3, 1.4920-4930 was a short-term resistance. I could have added
more to my position when that level broke, with a stop at 1.4900.</p>
