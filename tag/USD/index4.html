            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The U.S. dollar finally picked up some strength last Thursday and I
loaded to ride the trend. One of the earliest trade I made in this wave
is going long on USD/CHF. Figure 1 is taken today after a full week
since the initial move in USD. The vertical line marks the day when I
entered this trade on Thursday 22nd late afternoon. Here are my reasons
for making the entry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parity level 1.0000 was a mere 30 pips away from the low the day
    before</li>
<li>Obvious positive divergence on the indicator, Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Breakout on the shorter 3-hour timeframe, Fig. 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>I placed the order just above the resistance and beyond the short term
channel. The order was filled the next day in the morning on the 23rd.
In hindsight, I should have used a half position only and added to it
once it broke the longer term descending resistance as shown in Fig. 2.
That's because a short term break is a low probability move given that
the downtrend was strong. However, USD/CHF was testing parity, which is
as strong a support as you can find for many reasons. As you can see
from Fig. 2, the entry was rather good overall (could have been better
as discussed above). However, I think the exit was also a disciplined
move. My original target was 1.026 as noted below. It was just below
that horizontal resistance at 1.0267 which I marked on Fig. 1. Yet,
there's also the longer term trendline marked on both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.
I had 4-5 positions open at the time and this was one of my strongest
two (the other being CAD/JPY short), so I tried to add to my position
once the pair broke that longer term trendline. However, the line proved
to be strong as USD/CHF retraced and took out my stop as shown in Fig. 2
(red dot, 2nd from right). Nevertheless, the pair remained above 1.0200
and my core position was safe (I moved my stop up). But not all was
well. USD/CHF eventually broke 1.025 but it didn't go far. It printed a
couple more bars on the chart while I kept moving my stop closer and
closer. Also noting that the pair was short-term overbought, I moved my
stop right up to below 1.025 at 1.0245 to lock in most of the profit.
That stop was eventually taken out and the pair took a dive as shown in
Fig. 2. Moving the stop up tight in a short-term overbought condition
was a good choice. I learned this from my recent trades when I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdcad-all-out-1-0872-196-6-pips-and-1-0821-145-6-pips/">left
profits on the table</a>. So I got out against my hope for higher pips
even when the talk of USD making a return to strength was ubiquitous. I
traded what I saw and not what I hoped for, and against the opinions of
other people. If only my entry was a bit more patient, this would have
been one of my best executed trades. Below are the data for my entries.
Position size: 100% First Entry: 1.009 First Stop: 1.0030 First Target:
1.0260 Reward / Risk #1 = 170 / 60 = 2.8 \&lt; 3, but close enough. Second
Position Size: 25% Second entry/stop: 1.0232/1.0220 I didn't have a
target in mind for this addition because it was only to add on the
strength of the existing position.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This was definitely one of my better executed trades recently. Here's my
logic for the entry and exit. As shown in Fig. 1, at the time of entry
(marked by the faint vertical line on 10/23), NZD/USD made a negative
divergence with a higher price and lower RSI. There has been a series of
false alarm on the RSI overbought entry signals. However, 0.76 is an
important resistance because it is where the massive downturn started in
July 2008. I timed my short entry based on Figure 2. We made a lower
high just below 0.76 and within the previous channel. Then I waited for
the current downtrend to break the ascending support line to place the
order. The order was subsequently filled on Sunday night during the
Asian open when I was sleeping. Frankly, I wasn't too happy at first
because my fill price was right at the low. I kept my position anyway
and allowed the stop to work for me. This is probably the best decision
I've made with this trade. By remaining patient, I didn't succuum to
micro-managing my position like I've done before. With regard to the
exit, I took profit at my target at the ascending support shown in
Figure 1. That support line worked well for half of the year in this
rapid ascend of NZD/USD. So I didn't want to risk a bounce by taking
profit at this point. However, NZD/USD has traded down to 0.7260 as I'm
writing this. Time will tell if the exit is a good one or that I should
have left half the position in. The net gain for this trade is \$79.82
because I mistakenly entered a full position instead of half as I
should. Here are the R/R that I saw when I entered this trade. Position
size: 100% Entry: 0.7520 Stop: 0.7600 Target: 0.7300 Reward / Risk = 220
/ 80 = 2.75 \&lt; 3. I thought I was entering with only a 50% position size
because of the R/R not meeting my criteria. However, I read my own
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">forex position sizer</a> wrong and gone in with a full position.
Luckily, things have worked out. But I have since updated my position
sizer so this won't happen again.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I started to doubt this move mere minutes after placing it, which rarely
happens. And not because of the price action. It was solely for my
reasoning for this trade. On a quick mental review of this entry, I
noticed that they sounded more like excuses than reasons. First sign of
it was that I laid in a 100% position to fade a strong trend on the
daily on the basis of my 3-hour chart. My strategy is to not risk more
than 50% (preferably 25% - 33%) to fade a trend on the daily. Lack of
discipline #1. Next, I already had six 50% positions open at the time.
That would roughly translate to 3% of my account, without even taking
into account the high correlations (working on a spreadsheet for this).
By adding this 7th position, I've broken my fundamental rule of risk
management to not risk more than 3% of the totals funds at any single
moment. Lastly, it was the end of the trading day on Friday. Carrying
trades over the weekend is well known be even more risky than usual
because so much could happen over the two days. To add a low probability
trade on a loaded to the neck account into the weekend is practically
suicidal. I'm just glad that I had a hard stop to limit my risk. At
least I did something right here. In terms of the dollar amount lost,
the loss for this trade is \$44.17 on paper. And after this stupid move,
I have given up all my +500 pips gain (also on paper) from the week
before. Much work remains to be done to improve my trading performance.
A last note to self from this what-not-to-do lesson. All trades should
be taken with logic and reasons. I failed to do that in this trade by
convincing myself that USD should reverse over the weekend. On top of
it, I took as big of a position as my system allows to gamble on this
intuition. These are two breaches of trading rules that could ruin an
account. It's good that I'm stopped out with a loss in this trade
because if this became profitable, it could boost my ego and this
problem would only get worse. Another silver lining in this is that I am
beginning to trade forex with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> instead of diving in
with real money first. In addition to testing my forex strategies (which
I haven't followed as diligently as I should), I'm learning much about
my weaknesses in trading in general by keeping a detailed journal and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">statistics of my trades</a>. Update: EUR/USD cratered to 1.4844 today.
Another shortcoming with an undisciplined trade is the opportunity cost.
If I weren't so preoccupied with the stop loss from this morning, I
would have followed my setup and shorted EUR/USD today as it went
spiraling down.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well, that descending trendline didn't last long for GBP/USD. I shorted
it when it was testing it and saw that the RSI was at a prior high too
(Fig. 1). I placed my order just below the short-term ascending support
to hope for a break to the downside, see Fig. 2. GBP/USD consolidated
around that short-term support for a few hours and has now broken upward
to a strong resistance at 1.6600. It's the top of a previous congestion
zone, highlighted rectangle in Fig. 1. GBP/USD at 1.666 is a very
tempting short, but never short a new high, as my rules say. So I'm
gonna wait for a few more hours with this and see how it goes. Position
size: 50% Entry: 1.634 Stop: 1.645, stopped out. Target: 1.6100 Reward /
Risk = 240 / 110 = 2.2 \&lt; 3, so only 50% position. I think I'll stick
with the 3 factor as a limit. Even these 2+ trades aren't working so
well for me because my probability of success has been low.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>This log is written about 18 hours after the entry. I entered long
USD/CAD at the market last night for a 1/4 position size. USD/CAD took a
brief run up of about 100 pips. Naturally, I moved the stop to just
above breakeven to make this a risk-free trade for over the weekend. I
entered this position for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strong support at 1.0300, Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Positive divergence of lower low, higher RSI since August.</li>
<li>Break of short-term resistance, see Fig. 2</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that both Figures were taken at the time of entry 18 hours ago.
Position size: 25% Entry: 1.02988 Stop: 1.02080 Target: 1.0550, although
1.0400 might be hard to break. Reward / Risk = 251.2 / 90.8 = 2.7 \&lt; 3.
That's why I'm only entering a 1/4 position to test the water.</p>

broke 1.49 (Fig. 1). I waited til it marked a short term top at 1.4920
(Fig. 2) and then placed a stop entry just above it at 1.4921. EUR/USD
traded above it for a few hours but failed to break 1.4970. It has now
retraced to a short term support. If it continues to decline, the double
divergent top will be all written over the wall (Fig. 1) and it'll be a
good short for the next few weeks. Until it moves out of this trading
range though, this is still an uncertain trade. On another note, I have
now had a string of 7 consecutive losses. Good thing these are merely
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trades</a> for experimentation. Looking over the history and
statistics, it's apparent that many of these trades were taken to <strong>try
for the top/bottom</strong> just after signs of reversal in the short term
(except for this EUR/USD trade, which is with the trend). Thus, from now
on, if I'm to go against the intermediate trend (daily), limit my
position size by reducing a 50% position size entry to a 33% entry, at
most. Furthermore, only enter when the instrument has marked a short
term lower top and has broken the immediate support. After paper trading
for a month, my forex trending strategy is finally starting to take
shape...</p>
