            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My last half of USD/CHF long just got stopped out @ 1.0300. As shown in
Figure 1, USD/CHF is now in bearish territory. I'm going to wait and see
if the support at 1.0300 can hold tonight. Here are the statistics for
my two trades (each 1/2 position counts as a trade): Entry: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdchf-entry-1-0320-stop-1-0300/">1.032</a>,
full position at 6000 units Stopped out: 1.03099 and 1.0300 Net Pips:
-10.10, -20 Net \$: -\$3.03, -\$6.01 Time Held: 32 minutes, 83 hours %
Drawdown: -0.10%, -0.19% % from Top: 0.30%, 0.61% In hindsight, I should
have paid more attention to the short term trend. The break of the
recent trendline should have been a warning sign against going long. As
I'm still trying to work out the details to this strategy, these paper
trades have been tremendously helpful.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My NZD/USD short at 0.72509 just before noon today got stopped out an
hour later at 0.72661. At least it was only a 1/2 position. I wanted to
short again when NZD/USD broke 0.7280 because of the resistance as shown
in Figure 1. However, remembering #1 in my newly updated <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">3 trading
rules</a>, I re-considered and held back. NZD/USD is testing 0.7300 at
this moment, so this rule is proving itself useful already. What's
interesting now is that as NZD/USD is testing 0.7300, both USD/CAD and
USD/CHF are well off the support levels of 1.0700 and 1.0300,
respectively. There's no particular reason for using these two pairs,
they are just two pairs that I've been following. Which seems to me that
the weakness is USD isn't as bad as it would seem. If it is, then US
dollar would be under pressure in all fronts. And it's not now. At least
not yet. Thus, not giving up on this nice setup as shown in Figure 1,
I've placed a short stop entry for 50% position just below the next
intraday support at 0.7262. Just to catch it on its way down from this
very obvious resistance level. In any case, here're my 5 reasons for
shorting based on Figure 1.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend is neutral</li>
<li>We're at the top of a trading range</li>
<li>Near resistance at long term Fib level and round number at 0.7300</li>
<li>Potential double top, although this is very uncertain</li>
<li>Little breathing room in recent climb up</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, here is my order: Size: Half position, 3000 units Side:
Short Stop entry: 0.7262 Stop exit: 0.7300, set to trail Target: 0.7132,
top of that uptrending line in Figure 1 Reward / Risk = 130 / 38 = 3.42
> 3 I'm pondering should I enter 50% position when NZD/USD is hanging
around 07290. But I think I'll hold it off since my USD/CHF is still
open. Update: My short entry was triggered for 0.72509 (horrible
spread). I was stopped out at 0.72661 an hour later for a net loss of
\$4.57. This was not a good trade because NZD/USD was so close to a
round number resistance that it was probable to test it.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I figured I should write this sooner before the market moves more and
skew my thoughts on this entry. After my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdchf-out-at-1-03998-50-pips-and-1-03798-30-pips/">earlier entry in USD/CHF were
stopped</a> out this morning, I tried to enter once, got stopped out; and
then an even better setup appeared, so I entered again. See Figure 1.
This is a really awesome setup for the following 5 reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend is on our side as it's still pointing up.</li>
<li>Identical setup to last week's dive before the climb, same RSI, same
    candlestick</li>
<li>Bounced right at 1.031, which is at a longer term Fibonacci fan line
    as shown in Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Another support at round number 1.030, which is very near.</li>
<li>Good reward/risk ratio, see below for calculation.</li>
</ol>
<p>I entered 6000 units (2/3 position as usual) and placed the stop at
1.0300, just 20 pips away. USD/CHF climbed up to 1.0345 almost
immediately after my entry. So I moved my first stop to 1.0310
(Fibonacci level) for half my position. That got taken out minutes later
and it marked the bottom (for now) at 1.0309. I was a bit too hasten to
move my stop up for this part. See Figure 2 for my orders. One big
caveat to this entry is my tight stop at 1.0300. It is simply too
obvious of a stop price. I'd imagine the market would try to gun the
stops there before a run-up. However, if 1.030 breaks, it would ruin the
setup as described above. And if they're able to break that level, who
knows how far this can go further down. So I'm keeping my stop as is.
Anyway, I still have half of my initial position left. USD/CHF is
trading around 1.034. I don't think I'll do anything to this position
for now. I'm comfortable with just half position sitting in for the
weekend. Entry: 1.0320, Fib fan line support, see Fig 1. Stop 1: 1.031,
triggered already for a loss of 10 pips. Stop 2: 1.030, round number
support. Target: 1.038 - 1.040, starting point of this quick dive.
Reward/Risk = 60 / 20 = 3, right on the line of my goal. Although I am
secretly eyeing the 1.045 level as a target, I'll be cautious starting
from 1.038. Probably by setting a trailing stop if we do touch that. As
always, let's wait and see how this goes.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm all stopped out of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">USD/CHF positions from a couple of days
ago</a>. I considered re-entering when we failed to break 1.037 a few
minutes later. But the 1.04-1.043 range seemed heavy, so I postponed
that idea. About this trade, the maximum drawdown was terrific at a mere
0.12% (see stats below). I seem to do well with my entry. However, I'm
leaving profits on the table once again. For my second exit, USD/CHF
touched a high of 1.0451 but I was only able to get out at 1.03798.
Granted, this portion is supposed to be loose to capture bigger moves,
but that didn't happen. So once again, <strong>I need to work on my exit</strong>.
Another thing here is that my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">USD/CHF target of 1.045</a> was spot on. I wanted to exit half
my position at that level. But I couldn't figure out how to do both
target stop and stop loss at the same time after my entry order is sent.
This problem has been resolved by asking customer support at Oanda. I'm
not entering any more new trade (aside from the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-nzdusd-entry-stop-0-7040/">NZD/USD stink bid</a>
which I placed this morning) because it's Friday and I don't see anymore
obvious good setup across the board (a small board) for my 4h timeframe.
<strong>Update:</strong> Nevermind, I was eyeing 1.0350 when I got stopped out as a
entry point. USD/CHF just touched it as I'm writing this post. So I'm
back in now with a tight trailing stop... (and it doesn't seem to be
holding after just a few minutes... and it's stopped out for an
additional loss of \$4.86 on this tap.) Entry: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">1.03498, 6000
units</a> Stopped out 1:
1.03998, 3000 units Stopped out 2: 1.03798, 3000 units Net: \$14.97 +
\$8.97 Time held: 14:51:00 and 37:10:00 Max. Drawdown %: -0.12% for both
Net from Max. Gain: 102.40% and <strong>237.33%</strong></p>
