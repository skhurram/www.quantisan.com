There are a few choices to minimize your risks in times like these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stay on the sideline until the dust settled.</li>
<li>Target higher time frames with larger stops and smaller positions.</li>
<li>Partner up with someone from another timezone.</li>
<li>Set a trailing stop.</li>
<li>Set alerts to wake you up on extraordinary events.</li>
<li>Use a position management bot.</li>
</ol>
<p>I opted for #6. What about you? The picture is worse in equities as you
are locked in your positions overnight. [caption id="attachment_5527"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My semi-automated trading system, Quantised Trading Desk, closed its
first trade this week. I was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-eurgbp-as-hedge-and-bearish-nzdusd-as-diversification/">bullish EURGBP</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-usdjpy-on-week-of-april-17-2011/">USDJPY</a>, and
bearish NZDUSD as per the previous discussions. The QTD system saved me
from the premature calls in both USDJPY and NZDUSD by not making any
trade this week. That, in and of itself, has made me very happy with
QTD's first week of live trading. Particular in light of how fierce that
USDJPY down move has been. As a bonus, QTD entered a long position in
EURGBP for a small 0.19% gain as illustrated below. My parameter were a
maximum of 0.25% risk per position. The gain could have been better if
it weren't for that 61% retracement. Not that I'm complaining as I
haven't even looked at the market this past couple of days while the
system is trading for me. USDJPY touched my threshold support price
80.70, my bullish sentiment needs to be reevaluated. NZDUSD just cracked
a higher high (marginally though), so I'm easing on the bear button for
now. EURGBP is testing some resistance to, so I'm not so eager to dive
in again. Overall, I've been 2/3 wrong. I've told you before that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-didnt-miss-a-boat-i-missed-a-freakin-rocket/">I'm
very bad at timing the market</a>. That's why I developed QTD to trade
for me. Seeing that it's a long weekend, and I'll be way from town, I'm
just going to shut down my remote trade server in London until next week
when I can have some time to re-do my analysis. [caption

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've had more time to study the market tonight and is running a second
and a third instances of Quantised Trading Desk (QTD) to trade 3
currencies in total simultaneously. For my dollar bull sentiment, I'm
dividing between USDJPY long and NZDUSD short. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-usdjpy-on-week-of-april-17-2011/">QTD still hasn't taken a
position in USDJPY in the past 24 hours</a>. That's a good thing as
USDJPY is still drifting downward today even as the dollar is gaining
some ground. My line in the sand is at 80.70 for USDJPY and above 0.8100
for NZDUSD. EURGBP long is a hedge against my dollar longs. Again, I'm
not making any trade at this point but merely <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/quantised-trading-desk/">setting up QTD to wait
for the right moments to enter</a>. A break below 0.8660 for EURGBP would
challenge my bullish bias. These three currencies should be my complete
market bias for a while. I'm just going to let QTD do its thing and
trade for me. Hopefully this will be the last you'll hear from me about
my market bias for a while. [caption id="attachment_5342"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have unofficially launched my Quantised Trading Desk (QTD) expert
system this weekend as the system is ready for live trading after almost
a year in development. You can't miss the announcement if you visit the
new frontpage of this blog. So, I won't talk about it anymore here. The
purpose of this post is to discuss my forex trade. It's been over 7
months since I've traded on the forex market. I have been working on QTD
during all these months to improve my overall trading. Anyway, let's
dive right to it for my first trade back into forex. I am bullish on the
U.S. dollar this week. Why? The Financial Times is letting on <a href="">rumours
that the US Fed is signalling an end to quantitative easing</a>.
Coincidentally, the U.S. dollar appears to be testing supports across
all major currencies. Secondly the US equities market hasn't been able
to make higher highs even as the dollar is marking new lows. Still, I'm
not one to call a bottom, nor am I hunting for one. This is merely a
good risk-reward trade to gun for an obvious move. In particular, USDJPY
appears to be the best of the bunch as its been holding well over the
past few months while the dollar crumbled. The fact that Europe and US
are rumoured to be lighting up on the money printing whereas Japan's
money printing press is on full steam for the quake reconstruction (Yen
bearish) is a decent excuse to place some chips on USDJPY. You might
have noticed, I haven't specified my entry price, amount, or stop loss
price as usual. This is because I am relying on the Quantised Trading
Desk expert system to trade USDJPY for me. QTD will monitor the market
for me and execute trade entries and exits as it sees fit to accumulate
a long position in USDJPY. All the risk management and quant analysis
are built into the system. So I don't have a position yet because I'm
waiting for QTD to do the grunt work. [caption id="attachment_5332"

<p>The reason why I took this trade was that the opportunity seemed too
good to pass on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/short-usdcad-1-0654-stop-1-077/">based on my analysis at the time</a>. I
always keep an eye on the market even when I'm not trading. Although the
basic setup remains intact, the opportunity isn't so fantastic that I
couldn't say no anymore.</p>
<p>Anyway, I shouldn't be wasting time managing a minuscule trade. Back to
staring at codes.</p>
