            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have unofficially launched my Quantised Trading Desk (QTD) expert
system this weekend as the system is ready for live trading after almost
a year in development. You can't miss the announcement if you visit the
new frontpage of this blog. So, I won't talk about it anymore here. The
purpose of this post is to discuss my forex trade. It's been over 7
months since I've traded on the forex market. I have been working on QTD
during all these months to improve my overall trading. Anyway, let's
dive right to it for my first trade back into forex. I am bullish on the
U.S. dollar this week. Why? The Financial Times is letting on <a href="">rumours
that the US Fed is signalling an end to quantitative easing</a>.
Coincidentally, the U.S. dollar appears to be testing supports across
all major currencies. Secondly the US equities market hasn't been able
to make higher highs even as the dollar is marking new lows. Still, I'm
not one to call a bottom, nor am I hunting for one. This is merely a
good risk-reward trade to gun for an obvious move. In particular, USDJPY
appears to be the best of the bunch as its been holding well over the
past few months while the dollar crumbled. The fact that Europe and US
are rumoured to be lighting up on the money printing whereas Japan's
money printing press is on full steam for the quake reconstruction (Yen
bearish) is a decent excuse to place some chips on USDJPY. You might
have noticed, I haven't specified my entry price, amount, or stop loss
price as usual. This is because I am relying on the Quantised Trading
Desk expert system to trade USDJPY for me. QTD will monitor the market
for me and execute trade entries and exits as it sees fit to accumulate
a long position in USDJPY. All the risk management and quant analysis
are built into the system. So I don't have a position yet because I'm
waiting for QTD to do the grunt work. [caption id="attachment_5332"

            <div class="article-content"> <p>It seem that USDCAD isn't about to die just yet. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/short-usdcad-1-0654-stop-1-077/">My USDCAD short</a> got
stopped out at breakeven this morning. In fact, the pair is still
struggling around the descending resistance line as shown in Figure 1.
It made a higher low so I won't be surprised if it cracks higher.

<p>The reason why I took this trade was that the opportunity seemed too
good to pass on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/short-usdcad-1-0654-stop-1-077/">based on my analysis at the time</a>. I
always keep an eye on the market even when I'm not trading. Although the
basic setup remains intact, the opportunity isn't so fantastic that I
couldn't say no anymore.</p>
<p>Anyway, I shouldn't be wasting time managing a minuscule trade. Back to
staring at codes.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is my first real forex trade after <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-holding-on-to-intermediate-term-support-at-1-0868/">a year minus one day of
studying the market</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a>. Shorted USDCAD based on
the following intermarket observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yesterday's equities sell-off held around S&amp;P at 1050</li>
<li>Overnight Asian market seem orderly, not every market followed
    through, but most did</li>
<li>European markets down move were slow overnight until US open</li>
<li>But perhaps most importantly, EUR/USD made a higher low with an
    increasing COT</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, as much as the sell-off tries to scare off people, the
markets don't seem to be moving in unison. So it would seem this move
(in equities, thus inverse USD) is still a bear trap in an intermediate
term bull rally. Plus this daily chart, Figure 1, for picking USDCAD
specifically. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

for trade execution.</p>

0.05% of capital with a hard stop at 1.077. Anything above 1.070 would
put me on alert though. Coincidentally, I first got into the forex
market by studying the loonie. Let's see how this first trade performs.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Finally a profitable trade in my USDCAD short after being stopped out a
few times. My decision last week to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-short-target-hit-1-0581-trying-something-new-to-hold-for-longer/">hold this for longer</a> after
USDCAD touched my target paid off. I moved my stop closer last Thursday
evening and the order got filled on Friday. However, as I type this on
the following Monday, USDCAD is trading even lower at 1.0478. It looks
as though my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">original target of 1.0415</a> is in the cards. Even though
this is a profitable trade with a 0.17% gain in my demo account, there
is one major flaw with this short USDCAD play. I was not able to squeeze
more out of this profitable move. As I've said, this short took a few
tries. In fact, if we consider all the entires and exits of this play.
My stopped out losses totaled 0.29% and my single win here is merely
0.17%. So I'm actually at a net loss of 0.12% from all these work. My
win/loss rate is about 40% based on my review of recent forex trades. I
was able to edge out more than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">10% profit in four months</a> because
when I am wrong, I take small steps. But when I'm right, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">pile into a
position</a>. Ever since my trading environment has changed, I've been
trying to trade a longer timeframe. This USDCAD short is my first
attempt on a new strategy. Evidently, I will need to re-think and
re-learn what I've become accustomed to in the past few months. One of
the necessary trait of a successful trader is to be able to adapt.
Markets change. Traders need to evolve with the markets or they will
become obsolete. This will be a good test of myself to see if I can
re-invent myself to adapt to a changing trading environment. [caption
