            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>What I thought would be an intermediate term hold turns out to have
lasted mere minutes. I bought Teck Cominco (TCK.B.TO) after a small
bounce at \$34 support during lunch today. Figure 1 shows the clear
support level. Also note the fact that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-43-mark-16-27-loss-0-5/">my recent shorts haven't been
working</a>, so I thought I would go with the flow and go long. [caption

immediately after my long entry (something I haven't done in a while).
TCK cracked the \$34 support swiftly to \$33.80, my mental support. My
alert was sounded and I kept an eye on it afterward. But then not long
after \$33.80, my hard stop at \$33.70 was filled and TCK traded down to
\$33.66 or so. It has now stabilized around \$33.80 as of 2pm. Figure 2
shows the intraday chart of TCK.B.TO. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

for this trade is (\$33.68 - \$34.10) * 250 = -\$105 - \$4.95 * 2
commission = -\$114.90 = -1.2% of account. My account is now
experiencing a 3.4% drawdown since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">the high on June 8th</a>. I can't
help but feel that this was a stop hunt. TCK is creeping higher at the
moment. However, as my initial position was stopped out, I am not going
to re-enter this trade just yet. Let's see what it does near the close
today. I am labelling this particular trade as a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">bad trade</a> because
my stop was clearly too tight based on the time frame that I am
observing. I should have reduced my position size and widened my stop to
account for the recent volatility. Update: TCK gapped down 7% the day
after. At least my exit was timely.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>My Barrick Gold short isn't working as I hoped. My puts premium is
moving closer to breakeven to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-abx-10oct-puts-46-00-4-00-mark-44-67/">purchase price of \$4.00</a>.
Furthermore, the market is cracking above <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-34/">resistance levels today</a>.
In particular, ABX.TO is marking a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern
after a test of its 50-day moving average support (Figure 1). Yes I
know, there's a massive resistance at \$44.00 for ABX.TO. But... As much
as I'd like to believe in the bears, this short position is not safe
anymore. I can't let a positive trade turn negative. It's better to miss
an opportunity than lose money. So I'm ditching this now to reduce my
risks at above breakeven seeing that I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-34/">another smaller short
position in play</a>. Which is underwater at the
close, by the way. My return on this trade is (\$4.15 - \$4.00) * 100
* 3 contracts = \$45 - \$12.95 x 2 commissions = \$19.10 I'm just
lightly short now and mostly in cash.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Right on the heel of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-250-hod-to-10-59-0-95-loss/">my oil short loss</a>, I am taking another stab at
shorting the market. This one is Barrick Gold (ABX.TO). I am moving away
from shorting financials because the puts premium are almost doubled
that of the calls! It seems that too many people are betting the banks
will take a hit in the next fall. In the long term, ABX.TO appears to be
in an up trend. However, the intermediate trend is turning negative as
shown in Figure 1. \$45 is an obvious resistance for ABX.TO. Even with
today's positive market moves, ABX.TO fail to catch on the bullish wave
and only touched \$44.86 in the morning optimism (Figure 2). Who knows,
perhaps it might break it sooner than later. But the reward/risk is
decent to short ABX.TO seeing that the \$45 resistance is right above.</p>

<p>I will give it a month's time to move below \$44.00. Worst case stop
loss is \$2.50 on the premium. That is (\$2.50 - \$4.00) x 100 x 3 =
-\$450 - \$12.95 x 2 = \$475.90 = 5% of account total. My mental stop is
\$3.00 on the premium. Which is about 3.3% of my account total.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update May 10: Looks like I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-illustration-of-what-it-means-by-missing-the-boat-in-trading/">missed the boat</a>. TCK.B gapped up almost
7% at the Monday open to \$38.88. I won't be chasing the market at this
point as the reward/risk ratio isn't appealing anymore. Update: I got
stopped out at breakeven (after commission) before I can post this piece
at the end of the day. I'm back to all cash going into the weekend. I am
taking a dip in Teck Resources (TCK/B.TO) with 110 shares bought at
\$36.03. This is a trade to "buy when everyone else is in fear".
Following my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-hell-and-back-a-review-of-tsx-after-a-v-day/">assessment of the market yesterday</a>, I don't think
things are that bad, yet. So I am establishing a small position in a
strong company today. TCK is trading on its 200 day moving average at
\$35 this week (Figure 1). Yesterday's epic dive and recovery didn't
break this \$35 support. So that's a very good sign for TCK.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Tech Resources
(TCK-B.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO.png" />][][/caption] Furthermore, \$35 is an obvious
psychological round number support. It is also above the recent low of
\$32.50 printed in February of this year as shown in Figure 1. The
oscillator value (top of Figure 1) is making a positive divergence as
TCK is testing this support level). I entered today based on the 5-day
intraday chart. This morning's opening hour test of \$35 support has
lower volume than earlier this week (Figure 2). As such, I think \$35
can hold. So I entered when the price shot above minor resistance at
\$36.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TCK-B.TO
intraday snapshot at time of entry"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO-intraday.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO-intraday.png">1</a>[/caption] The price
drifted back under \$35.50 after I entered but then reversed and tested
\$37. I moved my stop loss to breakeven as it touched an equidistance
price opposite of my stop. Just so I don't see profits turn into losses.
If I get stopped out today, I will not re-enter until after the weekend.
My target is \$40 and original stop was \$35 for about a 4 to 1 reward
to risk ratio. I am risking 1.25% in this trade with a position size of
110 shares.</p>
