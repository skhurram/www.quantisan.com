            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Markets hitched a one-way train in the third quarter. TSX opened in July
at 11200. It closed September at 12368. A whopping 10% jump in three
months! S&amp;P500 made a similarly impressive 9.7% jump. We simply don't
get 10% moves even in most <em>years</em>. I made fewer trades this quarter but
held each one for longer to ride the trend. However, I am not as
successful as I'd hope. In particular, my worst trade this quarter was
in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/ven.to/">Ventana Gold</a> (VEN.TO). The position <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-350-ven-to-10-50-profit-0-8-re-bought-250-ven-to-10-67/">was profitable</a>, but the
money made was only a quarter as what I should have made. I was too
aggressive to go long when <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-400-ven-to-10-70-breakeven/">VEN.TO was heading into a brick wall</a>.
Ironically, my best trade this quarter was one that didn't make money.
In hindsight, I was wrong in the direction of a position but managed to
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-4-mfc-11jan-puts-14-00-1-74-mark-12-96-loss-0-1/">escape with just a scratch</a>. If I had been stubborn in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-jan-2010-puts-14-00-1-70-mark-13-25/">this failed
Manulife short</a>, my profit this quarter would have been wiped out. It
was a close call (technically, it was a put contract). It looks as
though I did <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-whole-year-two-hundred-and-six-posts-later/">learn something in the past year</a>. My main focus this
quarter has been the backend of my trading work. Namely in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative
finance study and development</a>. My automated strategy performed well
in the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> JForex contest. I won sixth place in July and first
place in August. My win streak (I also won in April) garnered the
attention from the people at Dukascopy and they kindly invited me to the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">Geneva Forex Event for a TV interview</a>. By far the most impressive
thing that happened to me this quarter was <a href="../pictures-from-geneva/">this trip to Geneva</a>.
<strong>Quarterly Metric Q3 Q2</strong> Sarting Fund \$9,404.87 \$8,000.00 End of
Quarter Fund \$9,630.75 \$9,404.87 Total Net Profit \$225.88 \$1,404.87

this in the last quarter, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/june-and-second-quarter-2010-trading-review/">commissions are the bane of my trading</a>.
Last quarter it took away 11% of my total return. This time it's 54%!
The structure of my equities commission requires that I trade less but
punch hard. This isn't my style. My intention is to trade less by being
more picky in my RRSP trading account. The 0.85% max. drawdown this
quarter is impressive though. I sometimes lose more than that in a
single position. Sterling Ratio 0.22 1.44 Excess Return 2.29% 17.46%
SDev Return per Trade 1.01% 2.21% Kurtosis 1.89 -0.93 Skewness 1.65 0.72
Despite my modest 2.4% return this quarter, it's not a good number in
light of the market liftoff. My low <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/">modified Sterling Ratio</a> says so.
On the other hand, the statistics from my trades improved. I achieved
consistency by lowering the standard deviation of my trades and skewed
my trade returns more to the positive. Yet another thing to caution is
my high kurtosis value. Which means my total returns are due to big
profits from a couple of trades. Other than these, there is not much to
add about the rest of the data. 95th Percentile P&amp;L \$193.49 \$421.15

<h2>Goal for the Fourth Quarter</h2>
<p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/june-and-second-quarter-2010-trading-review/">goal from the previous quarter</a> is to learn and build my first indicator in JForex. I achieved
that just this week. However, I plan to change direction in my work by
using less JForex and using more custom tools. My goal for the next
quarter is to learn R programming and
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">implement a JForex to R
data exchange system</span> (done, good old CSV files).</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Market volatility continues in June. I took a more aggressive approach
this month and executed more trades in my RRSP trading account. The
monthly return is excellent but I noticed a few issues with my trading.
These will be the main topic of this post. Let's go over some
performance data. Seeing that it is the end of the second quarter, I
will do a quarterly statistical report. I couldn't do <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">a monthly review
like I used to</a> because I trade much less frequently now. Note that
the October data is from last year's forex trading. That was the best
month I've had. I am attaching the data here just for comparison.
<strong>Quarterly Metric Q2 October</strong> Sarting Fund \$8,000.00 End of Quarter
Fund \$9,404.87 Total Net Profit \$1,404.87 Gross Profit \$1,800 Gross
Loss -\$395 Profit Factor 4.56 1.75 Net Profit % <strong>17.56%</strong> 4.19% Max.
Drawdown % 3.36% 2.32% Total Commission \$155.1 Commission / Net Return
<strong>11.04%</strong> This highlight the bane of my problem trading my RRSP.
Although <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> offers the best commission in Canada as far as I
know, it is still much higher than those offered by brokers in the
states. However, this is a self-directed RRSP trading account, so it's
not like I can just switch broker. I will just have to stop being so
active in my trading for this particular account. Sterling Ratio 1.44
0.65 Excess Return 17.46% 4.14% SDev Return per Trade 2.21% 0.79%
Kurtosis -0.93 8.53 Skewness 0.72 2.49 These statistics above show my
second problem. Although I am very profitable so far, my return per
trade is not consistent. The distribution is too flat and not skewed
enough to the positive for my liking. A standard deviation less than 1%,
a slightly positive kurtosis, and a skewness above 1.0 would be ideal.
95th Percentile P&amp;L \$421.15 \$70.11 5th Percentile P&amp;L -\$102.13

Largest Winning Trade \$464.05 \$171.79 Largest Losing Trade -\$116.75
-\$44.17 Most of my winning are due to <a href="../sold-12-cve-to-puts-2-90-mark-27-50-10-gain/">this Cenovus short in May</a> and
<a href="../sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">this CIBC short in June</a>. Avg. Time Held 5.17 days 2.18 hours Aside
from trading my RRSP account, I have finally opened a live <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">forex
account at Dukascopy</a>. My time remains split between developing
automated strategies for trading forex and manual equity trading as
usual. My JForex contest strategy in June ends up near the bottom again
as I took the wrong side of the move on USD/CAD. The JForex contest will
start with a new set of rules for July. Namely that strategies need to
be fully automated and winnings from each trade cannot be excessive
(50%) to prevent an all-in approach that's been dominating the contest.
My revised strategy is ready. It is now version 2.14 since the first
release in April.</p>
<h2>Goal for July</h2>
<p>My goal for July is to learn the indicators part of the JForex API and
to program my first custom JForex indicator from my other collection. I
will be away in Hong Kong for two weeks in July for some family matter.
So there's not much time to work.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>May 6th was a historical day in the market. The [Dow tanked 9% in
minutes but climbed back up near the end of the day][]. We have since
closed below that level later in the month. The bears seem to have
finally awoken. I closed two trades in May totalling a decent gain of
10% in my RRSP trading account. The first was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-12-cve-to-puts-2-90-mark-27-50-10-gain/">shorting CVE.TO</a>, which
made me 10%. The second was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-110-tck-b-to-36-03-stopped-out-at-breakeven/">long TCK/B.TO</a>, which ended in breakeven.
I took the second half of the month off for my wedding in Dominican
Republic. I opened two positions before leaving for vacation. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cm-to-10oct-puts-5-00-mark-74-02/">shorted
CM.TO</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-380-hnd-to-7-25-stop-7-00/">bought some HND.TO</a>. The market made a roller coaster
run up and then down while I was away. So I wasn't able to cash in on
the move. As for my forex endeavour, I bombed the JForex contest this
month. I started well with a 60% gain in the first week but I got greedy
and tried to go for higher. My contest account (demo only, not real
cash) whipsawed around breakeven a few times afterward. Then I just gave
up on this month's contest. I verified with the official that my
startegy wouldn't have qualified anyway because I was manually
intervening too many times. Nevertheless, I updated my automated trading
strategy for June before going on vacation. I will be back at it again
competing in June. But not until my wife and I can settle down in our
new home first. We are still unpacking, buying furnitures, and tidying
up our new place as of this first weekend in June.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I made my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">first RRSP trade to short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) using
puts</a> in April. I also made my first careless mistake in my RRSP by
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-just-made-a-grave-fundamental-mistake-in-my-cve-to-trade/">buying more contracts instead of closing the CVE.TO position</a> as I
intended. As of this writing, I am still holding my puts options as the
slow decline seem to be underway. <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6421BP20100503">China's decision to hike reserve
ratio</a> is also helping by strengthening the dollar and putting another
warning on recent risk appetite. Despite putting my real money on the
line, my main focus lately has been the Dukascopy JForex Strategy
Contest. According to their rankings page, I finished at 4th place for
April's contest. Which means I may receive a USD \$1,000 credit to my
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">trading account at Dukascopy</a>. Even if I were to trade a \$5,000
account as I have done in my paper trading, I couldn't have earned 20%
in a single month <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">based on my past performance</a>. This contest is a
great way for me to fill my forex account with no monetary risk.
Frankly, I was just <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-gamble-or-not-to-gamble/">hoping to squeeze in a top 10</a> because I started
late in the April contest. So I am very happy to finish at such a good
position and receive (hopefully) a decent sum of prize money! For anyone
interested, I have discussed about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/">my winning automated strategy</a>
previously. Feel free to take a look at it to see what got me a 4th
place finish. I will be away on vacation in the last two weeks of May. I
don't expect much to happen with my trading this month as I'm inundated
with personal matters. My primary focus is still the JForex Strategy
Contest. I will be using a new semi-automated strategy this time. My
goal is to finish in the top 6 again.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>It is that time of the month again when I do my trading performance
review. However, I did not make any trade this month. Not because I was
procrastinating, but I spent all of my time this month to work on my
quantitative projects. This review will be a recap of my backend trading
development. I said in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/february-2010-trading-performance-review/">last month's performance review</a> that my
goal for March is "to write a rudimentary data analysis and
visualization program for historical forex data." Well, I finished <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/data-scraping-the-toronto-stock-exchange-extracting-3660-companies-data/">half
of it</a> and then realized that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/from-object-oriented-programming-to-object-oriented-design/">I need a better design for the
software</a>. So I studied yet another programming book (finished 3
programming books this month), on object oriented design and analysis.
The other major event for me this month is that I finally opened a
self-directed RRSP account at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> because the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/considering-investment-options-for-my-first-rrsp/">tax benefit is
too good to pass</a>. Consequently, I am starting to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-first-analysis-of-the-sptsx-60-index/">study the Canadian
stock market</a> for trading with a conservative, intermediate-term
manner (not buy and hold though). Lastly, it seems that I might be back
to trading forex sooner than I have thought. I signed up for an
automated trading contest at <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143">Dukascopy</a> earlier this week. Since they
are offering a cash prize, I thought I might as well reschedule and work
on my forex stuff now. I will write more on this topic at another time.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I barely traded this month. The total number of trades in February for
my forex demo account is ten. That's far from my regular 150 - 250
trades a month. Ever since my trading system was broken because of
technical difficulties, I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-to-do-when-life-gets-in-your-way-of-trading/">changed my priorities</a> in trading. I
spent most of my time in February learning a new programming language to
ramp up my quant and automated trading projects. I also tried a few
longer term trades this month. The results haven't been uplifting. I am
about breakeven by the end of the month with a net gain of .... \$2 in a
\$5550 demo account. As you can see, there's really not much point in me
continuing paper trading at this stage. It is taking valuable time away
from me to fix what's broken so that I can use my previously profitable
trading system again. As such, I'm going to put near 100% of my effort
to program a semi-automated trading system for the coming weeks, or
probably months. On another note. Seeing that it is tax season here in
Canada. I thought about my tax situation and considered <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">opening a
Questrade TFSA trading account</a> (affiliate link) to legitimately
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/">avoid income taxes from trading</a>. But after considering the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">cost and
benefit</a> of such a move, I concluded that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-4/">a TFSA trading account
isn't cost effective for me</a> at the moment. As I've spent most of the
month doing backend work, there isn't very much to review for my trading
this month. So let's just dive right into my statistics for the record.</p>
<h2>Performance Statistics</h2>
<p><strong>Monthly Metric February (January)</strong> Sarting Fund \$5,550.02 End of
Month Fund \$5,551.99 Total Net Profit \$1.97 (-\$67.42) Gross Profit
\$37 (\$375) Gross Loss -\$35 (-\$442) Profit Factor 1.06 (0.85) Net
Profit % 0.04% (-1.20%) Max. Drawdown % 0.50% (3.95%) Sterling Ratio
0.00 (-0.15) Excess Return -0.02% (-1.26%) SDev Return per Trade 0.15%
(0.11%) Kurtosis -1.36 (1.85) Skewness 0.79 (1.01) With only ten trades
this month, I don't have enough samples to make meaningful calculations
for the above statistics. 95th Percentile P&amp;L \$12.55 (\$12.23) 5th
Percentile P&amp;L -\$6.60 (-\$8.43) Net Profit Mid 90% Only -\$4.75
(-\$117.84) Interestingly, I noticed that my typical top and bottom 5th
percentile profit/loss are quite consistent. Total # of Trades 10 (186)
Percent Profitable 40.00% (41.45%) # of Winning Trades 4 (63) # of
Losing Trades 6 (89) # of Break-even Trades 0 (34) My percent
profitable trades seem to be near 40% month to month. That's good to
know as it's useful to calculate my statistical return expectancy as
I've done in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-3/">TFSA trading cost-benefit analysis</a>. Average Trade
Profit % 0.00% (-0.01%) Average Winning % 0.17% (0.11%) Average Losing %
-0.11% (-0.09%) Ratio Win% / Loss% 1.59 (1.20) By being more
discriminating in my trades, I've effectively increased my win/loss
ratio. That's good. Max. Conseq. Winners 3 (8) Max. Conseq. Losers 5
(20) Largest Winning Trade \$13.81 (\$22.66) Largest Losing Trade
-\$7.08 (-\$14.30) Avg. Time Held [hrs] 1.67 (0.73) Avg. max. unrealized
profit/ Realized profit (11.59)</p>
<h2>Goal for March</h2>
<p>My goal from January is <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/january-2010-trading-performance-review/">to learn MQL4</a>. I changed my plan since then
due <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">my lack of faith with using a proprietary scripting language</a>. I
learned Python programming this month and is now learning to use
specialized libraries to serve my trading needs. My goal for March is to
write a rudimentary data analysis and visualization program for
historical forex data.</p>
