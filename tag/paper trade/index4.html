            <div class="article-content"> <p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-change-of-wind-for-australian-dollar-shorted-audusd-0-9183-and-audcad-0-9546/">AUD/USD short from yesterday</a> played out exactly as I planned. But
I took profit a few pips earlier than I wanted because the bounce from
0.9025 fooled me. As you can see from Figure 1, AUD/USD is resting on
0.9000 support as I predicted. Now the million dollar question is,
should I go long in this currency pair because of the super long term
trend as I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-change-of-wind-for-australian-dollar-shorted-audusd-0-9183-and-audcad-0-9546/">discussed in my previous post</a>? That brown support line in which AUD/USD is resting on now
(Fig. 1) extends all the way back to April 2008. However, there's also a
nearby support at <a href="http://www.tradergav.com/2010/01/22/is-it-time-now-audusd-is-in-the-zone/">0.8945 as shown on Gav's Trading Blog</a>. Since I
don't trade such a long term timeframe, I will be more conservative on
this by watching how the price reacts in the short term at this 0.9000
level. Gold also broke below 1100 but is holding above its own support
around 1080-1090 too. Both markets are finding support at current
prices. Let's see how well they last. I am flat in this pair until
things are more clear to me. On another note, this isn't exactly a
victory as I've been trying to short the Aussie for days. You would have
been better flipping a coin in comparison to my success rate lately.
I've lost more than I have gained on this move so far. In fact, I am
still on handicap mode (half position size) as I'm <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/work-harder-trade-fewer-in-a-long-and-excruciating-trading-drawdown/">still in a 3%
drawdown</a> as shown in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trading log</a>. However, I am slowly
crawling my way out with limited risk and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade">profitable trades</a> such as
this.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>GBP/JPY finally broke below an intermediate term wedge pattern formed
from Dec 30. See Figure 1 for the daily chart. I am noticeably late in
this GBP/JPY short entry because I was preoccupied with other positions
(e.g. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/closed-eurchf-and-gbpchf-shorts-best-trade-ever/">my EUR/CHF and GBPCHF shorts</a>) today. In any case, this is an
intermediate term (a few days at least) play so there is no rush. My
first short was executed at 146.51 on obvious signs of short term pound
weakness versus the GBP/CHF pairs. GBP/JPY made some retracement on a
test of 146.00 but GBP/CHF kept on dropping, so I took a short position
once it touched the 146.50 resistance. My average price in this is
146.32. I have set my stop loss to lock in some profits already (which
might get taken out soon). Note that I just happened to be watching the
GBP/CHF currency pair as I have a position on shorting that too.
Otherwise EUR/GBP and GBP/USD would have been better for short-term
intermarket analysis because of higher liquidity. With regard to this
formation, as you can see on Figure 1, today's break of 147.50 gave way,
all the way, down to 143.00. This target price is estimated from the
height of the wedge pattern which it just broke through. The distance
from 147.50 to 143.00 is about the distance of the height of the wedge
(Dec 29th low to 30th high). Another reason for targeting this 143.00
price is because of my weekly chart of Figure 2. 142.50-143.00 is the
next support according to a long term trendline (lowest ascending white
line) as shown in Figure 2. GBP/JPY haven't seen these prices for a good
month, so hopefully the move down shouldn't be too difficult. As usual,
I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">stockpile my short position</a> in this gradually to limit risk.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been barking up the short-Aussie-tree since the beginning of the
year. See post [#1][], [#2][] on AUDJPY, and [#3][], [#4][] on
AUDCAD for the long term analysis. (Also see my post on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/early-bird-does-not-get-the-worm-in-forex-trading/">being early
shorting the Aussie</a>.) Anyway, now that AUDUSD has backed off the 9300
level with a bang, it seems that the trend reversal in the Aussie is
getting clearer. Why do I say that? Notice the sequence of recent AUDUSD
price action depicted in the daily chart of Figure 1.</p>
<ol>
<li>Breaking below lower long term trendline (thick brown line, Fig. 1)
    on Dec 14 followed by a 300 pips down move</li>
<li>Reversing on Dec 22 at 8730 price level, right on the last long term
    support line</li>
<li>Testing the same trendline in #1 from below and gliding along it
    since the new year</li>
<li>Bouncing off the previous resistance at 0.9330</li>
<li>A rapid breakdown right to the neckline support at 0.9100</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, the breakdown of gold price (Fig. 2) is helping to keep the
downward momentum in this currency pair. Now that recent moves are
confirming my long term Aussie short outlook as discussed previously
([#1][], [#2][], [#3][], [#4][]), my plan is to stay on the short
for the long haul. My target on this dive for the AUDUSD is down to
0.9000 corresponding to the long term support line of #2 in that list
above. Of course, prices don't go one way. So remember to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">manage
risks</a> and be prepared for some probable counter-trend moves. [caption

see that I've converted from shorting AUDJPY to shorting AUDUSD. The
simple reason is that USDJPY looks to have bottomed out and is on a run
upward. Thus, the US dollar has more potential strength than the yen to
go long. Lastly, as the title says, I also shorted AUDCAD at 0.9546 for
the long term. See Figure 3. That short is playing out nicely as well
with an [amazing long term bearish setup][#3]. [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>CAD/JPY failed a major resistance level at 90 and has edged out an
obvious intermediate-term downtrend (Fig 1). USD/CAD is also bouncing
off a major support at 1.0200 (Fig. 2). And crude oil is below \$80 on a
slippery slope. As such, shorting loonie seems like a good move at the
moment according to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC trading setup</a>. Yet, here is why I am
opting to short CAD/JPY and not long the more popular USD/CAD currency
pair. Figure 3 shows a 5-year, weekly chart of CAD/JPY (top) and USD/CAD
(bottom). Evidently, the exchange rate of CAD/JPY is still in a
depressed mode since the fall of September 2008. It's also clear on this
chart that why I say 90 is a major resistance level. Beside from being a
nice round number, CAD/JPY has failed to break above 90 twice since
August 2009. As for USD/CAD, the picture isn't as clear. 1.0200 is
definitely a very strong support because it marks the top of a 6-month
range in the first half of 2008. Yet, the downward slope in the long
term since 2005 is not to be ignored. As such, I do not dare to bet on a
bounce on this pair at this price. Moreover, the intermediate-term move
on both of these pair is giving us a confirmation. CAD/JPY is now
testing a falling trendling (Fig. 1). Whereas USD/CAD is testing a
falling support. Thus, I am shorting CAD/JPY under pressure. Going long
on USD/CAD now would be like betting it to bounce on a slippery slope.</p>
