            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Gold price made a 15 point jump over the weekend to 1160 and is
consolidating now (Fig. 1). Crude oil tested 84 and is back down to just
above 83 now. Yet, AUDCAD is still struggling to break above 9600 (Fig.
2). You would have thought that AUDCAD should mustered enough momentum
to break above this key resistance with all these gold bullishness and
oil bearishness. Thus, I am giving this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audcad-0-9489-stop-9540/">AUDCAD short setup as described
previously</a> another try. I am only risking 0.16% on this trade. It is
half of my usual initial entry. First because it is a FTR (reversal)
setup and second because I am in a 3% drawdown. So my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk
manaegment</a> rules dictate that I trade halved size. This setup is
according to the monthly and weekly chart, so it could take a while, and
probably more tries, before it shows its hands. I will keep shorting it
as long as it's below 9600 on the weekly. Limited by the amount at risk
according to my risk management rules, of course!</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been stopped out of all my Aussie shorts on the breakout today. But
my setups for AUDUSD and AUDJPY are still intact as the resistances are
still safe. Having failed so many times in shorting AUDJPY (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">first
try</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-retrying-audjpy-short-84-52-stop-85/">second try</a>), I am taking a conservative approach on that
particular play. Although those setups are ripe for entries, I'll wait
til the test of resistances hold first before entering short again in
AUDJPY and AUDUSD. Which begs the question of, why AUDCAD, and why now?
First of all, I still have conviction about my Aussie short because of
the setups as <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">discussed previously</a> and the fact that gold
price is holding the 40 day ema at 1135 at the moment. That 40 day ema
has worked well on the uptrend in the past few months. So it should be
respected if gold is indeed in a downtrend now as I surmise. So why
short AUDCAD instead of the popular AUDUSD? Simply because AUDUSD broke
out of a short term range whereas AUDCAD is still holding as seen in the
AUDCAD 3-hour chart of Figure 1. This shows AUDCAD is weaker even when
gold is making new short term high.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUD/CAD,
3-hour"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_3h.PNG" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>For the big picture, see Figure 2 for the weekly chart of AUD/CAD. We
see that 0.98-0.99 has always been the turning point for a massive 1000+
pips selloff. We've hit 0.99 back in November and the slide is already
in progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see from Figure 2 that AUDCAD bounced off the 40 week ema
in late December and ran up to 0.95 from 0.92. 0.95 is a decidedly
important round number resistance as it was also a peak in April of
2007. You know, the time before the economy started to crack as shown
with the topping in the markets.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUDCAD,
weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD.png">1</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Now that I've established that the trend is pointing down. I still need
to time my short entry.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the daily chart of AUDCAD. In view of the above
discussion, we have a good chunk of resistance above 9550 as marked by
the purple box in Figure 3. This is the all important safety net for
this short entry. As long as AUDCAD stays below 9600, this long term
setup remains intact. And don't forget the broken uptrend line.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUDCAD,
daily"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_day.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-06-AUDCAD_day.png">2</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Lastly, notice the RSI trends in both the 3-hour (Fig. 1) and daily
charts (Fig 3.), they are both showing negative divergences. Figure 1 is
my timing for this entry, see the current negative RSI divergence marked
by the downward trend in RSI versus the toppy price.</p>
<p>In summary, here are my signals for this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC setup</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Weekly chart shows downward trend.</li>
<li>Big resistance above current price on daily.</li>
<li>Broken uptrend line on daily on retracement from weekly chart.</li>
<li>Intermarket relation with gold testing 40 day ema at 1135.</li>
<li>Negative RSI divergence on 3-hour chart.</li>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">previous AUDJPY short entry</a> was early as I surmised (entered
without short-term confirmation). I made a number of ins and outs with
that trade as depicted in Figure 1. Some were winners, some were losers.
In all, it's around breakeven in that trade. However, I have re-entered
this short in AUDJPY just now at 84.52 using <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">the same long term
setup</a> (see weekly chart in that post) as
it hasn't been broken yet. Moreover, AUDJPY is in the process of making
a negative divergence on the 3-hour chart as shown in Figure 1. The key
word is "in the process". There is still a possibility of a breakout
upward from here. I am being aggressive to establish a position here
because of intermarket divergence in Aussie crosses versus gold price
overnight. See Figure 2. As you can see, gold made a marginally higher
high above 1130 on the 4-hour chart of Figure 2. Yet, neither AUDUSD nor
AUDJPY followed suit. Those two currency pairs are holding their
respective double top. The exception is EURAUD, it keeps diving
downward, but that can be accounted for by Euro weakness. It would have
been a perfect picture of EURAUD can hold its bottom though. I wouldn't
count this trade to work out just yet. That's why I'm only risking 0.2%
of my account with a small <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tools/forex-position-sizer/">position size</a> for now. As you can see
from my trade orders shown in Figure 2. I have a couple limit orders
just below the near-term supports to add to this short. My pawns have
been placed. Let's wait and see what the market does.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I haven't done one of these <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/entry/">trade analysis post</a> for weeks. So I
thought I'll start the year on this promising long term (more than a
week) trade on one of my favourite currency pairs, AUD/JPY. This entry
on shorting AUD/JPY is executed according to my Forex Trend Reversal
(FTR) setup. Figure 1 shows the weekly chart. Please excuse the mess.
There are only 3 relevant lines in addition to the price. Referring to
Figure 1, first line of note is the top of that 4-line descending
channel. Notice that 84.50 correspond with the resistance this week.
Secondly, there are 3 ascending trendlines drawn. We have a triple
X-cross on the 2 ascending and 1 descending lines at around 85.00 last
week. AUD/JPY failed to touch it. If this trade goes well, AUD/JPY
shouldn't test 85.00 again because it has missed its chance. That's
where I placed my stop. Anyway, these are just doodles on a chart, we
need confirmations. For that, let's take a look at the major Aussie
crosses and gold prices in Figure 2. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"
width="580" caption="AUD/JPY, weekly"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-04-AUDJPY.png" />][][/caption] [caption id=""

the 4-hour charts of Figure 2. From top to bottom, Figure 2 shows
AUD/USD, EUR/AUD, AUD/JPY, and GC (gold futures). We also see that gold
prices is staying at a depressed level below 1120. This rising Aussie
but toppy gold price is a sign of divergence. Furthermore, we have a
shooting star candlestick pattern in the previous gold price bar. Gold
spiked above 1130 briefly but couldn't hold above 1120 so far. Another
plus for the short. Now that the entry signals have been met. I needed
to time my entry. This the the part that I should have done better. I
basically just shorted it at the '50 resistance without giving it much
thought. The short-term bullishness is still strong and I really should
have waited for a lower high on the 3-hour chart. Figures 3 and 4 are
the daily and 3-hour charts, respectively.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUD/JPY,

smallish position in this trade at an obvious resistance level. My
intention is to add to it as long as AUD/JPY stay below 85. Also, a
safer stop should be 85.50 as seen from Figure 3 (daily). 84.40 was a
recent top in October. Lastly, I chose to short AUD/JPY instead of
AUD/USD because I have some other U.S. dollar longs already.</p>
