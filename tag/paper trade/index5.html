            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Seeing that this is my first commitment after the big drawdown, I'll
bring back my tradition of writing a post to log my rationale and market
conditions on this entry for later review. I sifted through the weekly
charts of all pairs on my watch-list tonight and found that USD/CHF long
is the most promising. Figure 1 shows my daily chart for the setup and
Figure 2 is a 3-hour chart with my entry timing. Let's talk about Figure
1 first. USD/CHF is making a triple bottom with a positive divergence as
shown. I have also marked the current major support at 1.0010. USD/CHF
has trade below it for about a week now but failed to break any lower.
Today is the first day when we've opened somewhat above it. Secondly,
note that we have broken above a descending channel as shown in Figure
1. USD/CHF has also tested the 1.0010 support twice already at both
sides of that channel. And accompanied with a positive divergence as I
said. The major caution as shown in Figure 1 is that we're still trading
below the 10-day ma. As for the entry timing, observe Figure 2. Notice
that USD/CHF just made a higher low outside and above the descending
fChannel (the two thicker brown lines). This is the signal for entry.
Note that the fChannel is my proprietary channel. This trade is
initiated according to my new Forex Trend Fading (FTF) setup. Position
size: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">100%</span>,
50%<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> </span> Entry: 1.0122,
from fRays signal. Stop: 1.0060, below major support Target: 1.0225,
first major resistance, ease off some at that point, add more above it.
Reward / Risk = 103 / 62 = 1.66 \&lt; 3. Not not good enough for my usual
R/R target, but I've been considering lowering it to 1.5. So lets see if
an R/R of 1.5 is a good enough number. I would have been more
comfortable with a 2.0 though. Anyway, let's see how this goes. Update:
I took half of it off at breakeven because of the lower R/R and the new
setup. Only 50% in this trade now. I'm looking to add a EUR or JPY cross
for my other half allocation. Update 11/19: I'm stopped out of this
position @ 1.0150 for +27 pips.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Having had <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-bad-eurusd-day-trading-and-what-to-do-about-it/">a hard time day trading the EUR/USD last week</a>, things
haven't been well for me this week either with the market in a gridlock.
My one and only viable setup so far is <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">built for a trending market</a>.
So this range-bound market is new territory for me as I experiment (in
hindsight, haphazardly) to come up with more profitable forex trading
setups. As you can imagine, trading without discipline is a recipe for
diaster. I have given back all the paper gain from this month by the
start of this week and is treading on thin ice with my demo account
dipping dangerously close to the November opening balance. Needless to
say, I do not want to see my account in the red for this month. But that
is what happened after today's string of failed trades. I am officially
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">in the red for this month</a>, for now. While there are several mistakes
I made resulting in this mess, I think it all boils down to one flaw in
my trading this week. Yes, those day trading stints I did surely have
put a dent in my demo account, but what's worse is that I've
unconsciously have let those losses affect my trading mentality. These
losses were stuck in my mind and my mental "goal" for this week was
recovering from them. However, I have approached the problem in the
wrong way by not wanting to lose anymore in my account. In other words,
I was afraid of losing. So how did that materially affect my trading?
Here is a simple example as illustrated in my order history on the
GBP/JPY chart attached at the bottom of this post. The 3 yellow
triangles are my short entries and the 3 red dots marks the stopped
exits. According to my setup, my original entry at 149.50 had a stop at
150.50. But I moved my stop closer to 149.80 in the morning because I
didn't want to risk more. That got taken out easily as 149.80 is within
the congestion zone. Then I tried to short it a couple more times with
tight stops because I see the downside potential to be still intact.
Those were eaten up alive too and now I don't have a position because it
would have been more foolish to keep trying in vain. While just 3 trades
wouldn't have done much damage, I was doing the same thing across the
board in shorting CAD/JPY and EUR/CAD. A few here and a few there. They
add up to a bad day. As of this writing, it looks like these pairs are
finally moving in my direction. But instead of being patient with
reasonable stops, I thought I could do better and micro-managed my
positions to end up taking multiple small losses and with nothing left
on the table to ride the move. So what is the correct way of following
up on a dent in the account? I should have done the following instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce risk exposure by limiting trade size or overall opened
    positions until I am back up.</li>
<li>Focus on what I did wrong last week and stop doing that, i.e. no
    more day trading.</li>
<li>Recall my best trades and do more of that, i.e. my one and only
    finalized setup, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not so coincidentally, now that I'm in the deepest drawdown ever, this
is as good as ever to put this emergency recovery procedure into
practice.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've stayed home from work this week because of the flu. So with spare
time on my hands, I had the urge to experiment with day trading the
forex market. Bad decision. After a good 3-4 days of day trading EUR/USD
with my demo account, here is what I have to show as illustrated in my
account balance graph for the past 4 trading sessions below.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Account balance

Nov 10-14, 2009</a>[/caption] Yes, you can push back up your dropped jaw
now. I considered not accounting for these losses in my paper trading
account because these trades were meant to be experimental only.
However, as the whole point of me paper trading the forex is to learn
and improve, I decided to keep these losses and suffer the consequences
of my own doing. Heck, I wouldn't have had the choice if this were real
money (which is the way that I should treat this demo account anyway). I
stepped out of my circle of strength (swing trading) into something that
has burned me many times before. Well guess what, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/1000-in-2-days/">history does repeat
itself</a>. Enough with lambasting myself. The real focus of this post is
to point out what I did wrong and what can I do to improve in day
trading the forex. Not that I'm intent on day trading though. This is
merely to increase my arsenal in forex trading. Figuring out what I did
wrong is actually obvious in hindsight. Figure 2 below depicts the
trades I made on Nov 13, which led to most of that steady decline in my
account balance as shown in Fig. 1. See the bounce from about 1.4820? I
kept shorting it and shorting it all the way up to 1.4880. What was I
thinking? The main reason for this epic failure is that I broke a
fundamental rule in trading. <strong>Trade what you see and what you thought</strong>
(Techniques of Tape Reading by <a href="http://www.realitytrader.com/blog/">V. Graifer</a>). Based on the previous
day's market sell-off from 1.5000 and the Asian markets failing to break
1.4900, I thought the market would follow through on Friday and break
through this 1.4820 support. In particular, just before NY open before
9:30am, EUR/USD had a couple of big drops, as shown in Fig. 2. All these
circumstances led to my believe that we'll see a weak day like
yesterday.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EUR/USD,
5m"][<img alt="EUR/USD, 5m" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_5m.PNG" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_5m.PNG">EUR/USD, 5m</a>[/caption] However, a support is
still a support until it's broken. I shouldn't keep shorting it even
though it has obviously bounced. While identifying the trend is trivial
in hindsight, what evidence did I have at the time to tell me that? The
evidence was in fact staring me in the face that morning. Figure 3 shows
part of the screen that I usually use for intra-day observation. As you
can see, S&amp;P500 rejected the previous day's close with a strong negative
TICK reading and then broke above the morning range. The TICK also
remained strong with many +800 readings in the morning. All the classic
signs that point to a strong positive trend.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="577" caption="intraday
sentiment"]<img alt="intraday sentiment" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-intraday_am.PNG" />[/caption] Furthermore, if only I had
stepped back and observed the bigger picture, as shown in Fig. 4 with a
30-minute chart, I would have seen that we have a great positive
divergence swing setup (and which I normally would have exploited if I
weren't so focused on trading the 5m that day).</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EUR/USD,
30-minute"][<img alt="EUR/USD, 30-minute" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_30m.PNG" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2009-11-13-EURUSD_30m.PNG">EUR/USD, 30-minute</a>[/caption] What
is my goal in future day trading? Instead of a declining equity curve as
in Figure 1, just flip it up-side-down and that's what would be perfect.
All I needed to change is being able to spot the right trend and ride
it. Easier said than done. So what is the moral of this story? I have
once again proven that I am still no good at day trading. Stick with
swing trades.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>A profitable trade is definitely a good thing. But when you sit idly to
see good profits turn into great profits, and then doing nothing to lock
in some of that windfall, it is time to review your trading strategy.
That is exactly what I have done last night when I saw my AUD/JPY shorts
took a 150 pips dive at the Sydney open to pass a strong support. And it
wasn't AUD/JPY only, all my 4 other pairs also pushed about 100 pips
deeper into the green to test their respective supports. But as quickly
as those unrealized profits appeared, it was quicker that they
evaporated. While I had <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">5 positions</a> last night and they all fit this
scenario, I will use my AUD/JPY short for this particular case study as
it was the most dramatic and easy to read. Here is a brief summary of my
AUD/JPY shorts. Figure 1 is a 3-hour chart of AUD/JPY showing my entries
and exits. I entered twice on Oct 29 (83.76 and 82.47, marked by yellow
triangles) and was stopped out with profits on Oct 31 and Nov 2 (81.7
and 81, marked by red dots). The trades ended up +147 and +206 pips with
1/2 the position size each. As shown in Figure 1, I did manage to
capture most of the down move nonetheless. So these weren't badly
executed at all. (I used my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">FTCS 0.1</a> as the trading setup, so I
won't go into the logic behind my entries and exits here.) What I'd like
to point out though is the long tail candlestick poking through the
support at 80.0. From Figure 2 daily chart, it is apparent that 80.0 for
AUD/JPY is a strong support from prior congestions. Not to mention that
it's a nice whole number. As such, it was naive of me to think that
AUD/JPY could break and maintain this depressed level on thin volume on
a Sunday (EST) Sydney open. Secondly, also note that in Figure 2, the
fall in price of AUD/JPY is quite extended as shown by the RSI's dive
from 90+ to about 40. Even if the pair is poised for further weakness,
there's bound to be some catch of breath before it can take on a strong
support. From the above 2 observations, which I did see at the time,
it's evident that I should have taken some profits (i.e. half of my
positions) when I had the chance. I knew in my mind that 80.0 was hard
to break, but instead of exiting on target, I merely tightened my stops
in hoping for more gains. Don't get me wrong. Using stops for entries
and exits have served me well and it will still remain my primary trade
order method. But if I'm to improve, to go from +200 pips to +300 pips
in a trade, I need to be able to spot and exploit other tools at my
disposal when extraordinary occasions such as last night's appear. So
what can I do in the future to prevent this from happening again? With 2
simple additions to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading strategy</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a profit target and take some chips off when the market reaches
    target at extreme conditions.</li>
<li>Keep these profit targets up-to-date according to the trading setup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that this is analogous to what I have already been doing with my
stops by moving them closeras the price action dictates. However, <strong>one
important caveat</strong> to this technique is that this should never override
the fundamental trading rule of letting profits run. I will only take
profits at a target if the price is severely over-extended according to
my trading setup. In any case, as [Ancient_Warrior][] wrote to me on
<a href="http://twitter.com/Quantisan">Twitter</a>, "<span><span>Well don't 'kick yourself' too much for 200
pip gains please! lol"</span></span></p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After many trials and errors with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex market</a>
for a month, the first of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setups</a> is finally taking shape.
So I would like to document this approach here after a well executed
trade this week (illustrated below). This trading setup is based solely
on technical analysis. Here's an overview of the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a long term time frame for identifying setup.</li>
<li>Draw the major supports and resistances.</li>
<li>Add a momentum technical indicator.</li>
<li>Add a trend indicator.</li>
<li>An entry is signaled by an agreement of the trend and the indicator
    at the support or resistance price level. Do not enter yet.</li>
<li>Define a short term time frame for timing, use this for the
    following steps.</li>
<li>Draw the supports and resistances on this short time frame.</li>
<li>Place an order when the price breaks the short-term trend to be
    aligned with the trend on the longer one.</li>
<li>Exit when the entry conditions are gone (not necessarily reversed).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is very vague. So here's a real example in practice. Figure 1 shows
steps 1 to 5 on the daily chart of CAD/JPY for a short entry. The entry
point is the bar before the marked vertical line on Oct 21. See that
CAD/JPY tested the descending resistance line (step #2) with a negative
RSI divergence (#3). The trend as suggested by the moving averages is a
choppy downtrend (#4). Thus, the conditions were met and a short entry
is signaled. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"

entry, Figure 2 is a 3-hour chart of CAD/JPY with the entries and exits
marked. Yellow triangles are entries and red dots are exits. I entered a
full position after CAD/JPY made the initial dive and then retraced to
the previous support (now resistance) line. It bounced right off that
line strongly (left side of figure). I entered at market price once we
made a hammer candlestick (negative signal) the bar before. Stop was
placed at 88.0, near the recent high and at a round number resistance.

I had a manually adjusted hard stop to be a couple of resistances away.
I kept it loose on purpose because this position was my biggest winner.
(Let your profits run). But once the RSI on the daily passed below 50, I
took a more conservative approach on the exit stop. Then once CAD/JPY
tested 84.50 and hung around 85.0, I tightened my stop and was taken out
at 85.30. Note that my original target was 84.0, so I thought testing
84.50 was close enough. Also note that this setup is expected to be
executed recursively. It is meant to be run so that you're <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">stacking up
your winning position</a> if the conditions and the trend is in your
favour. This is actually where the power with this setup kicks in. I'll
continue with the CAD/JPY example to illustrate this point. Notice in
Figure 2 that I added to this CAD/JPY short at the (second from the
right) yellow triangle point on the chart at 86.3 for 50% more units.
The down move was still intact as shown in Figure 1 at the time. Using
the same setup, I added more units to this position. And by adding 50%
more to my position, I was able to ride that last wave down for +200
pips on these extra units. Otherwise, I would have exited at 85.30 on
the consolidation around 85.0 and left with nothing on the market for
the last big wave. The timing as shown in Figure 2 for this addition
isn't the same as for the original entry. But it's obvious enough on the
figure with the same markings which I used. Simply refer to Figure 2 for
a visual explanation on the timing for this entry. In case you haven't
noticed on Figure 2, but I just re-entered this position with half the
size using the same setup. Since this third entry is still in progress,
I can't comment on it just yet. We'll see how it goes. Finally, for ease
of referencing this trading setup later on, I will call this particular
setup, FTC (forex trend-continuation). Right now it's version 0.1, a
first publication release but still in beta testing with my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper
trading</a>. Once the setup has proven itself, I will use it in live
trading with real money. Then I will christen it with a version 1.0, and
perhaps a better name. In the mean time, I expect more refinement to
this setup as I continue to try it out on paper trading. Check my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC
tag</a> for more sample applications of this trading signal. Update Nov
18, 2009: I've changed the name from FTCS to FTC as I now have a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTR">FTR</a>
setup.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The U.S. dollar finally picked up some strength last Thursday and I
loaded to ride the trend. One of the earliest trade I made in this wave
is going long on USD/CHF. Figure 1 is taken today after a full week
since the initial move in USD. The vertical line marks the day when I
entered this trade on Thursday 22nd late afternoon. Here are my reasons
for making the entry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parity level 1.0000 was a mere 30 pips away from the low the day
    before</li>
<li>Obvious positive divergence on the indicator, Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Breakout on the shorter 3-hour timeframe, Fig. 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>I placed the order just above the resistance and beyond the short term
channel. The order was filled the next day in the morning on the 23rd.
In hindsight, I should have used a half position only and added to it
once it broke the longer term descending resistance as shown in Fig. 2.
That's because a short term break is a low probability move given that
the downtrend was strong. However, USD/CHF was testing parity, which is
as strong a support as you can find for many reasons. As you can see
from Fig. 2, the entry was rather good overall (could have been better
as discussed above). However, I think the exit was also a disciplined
move. My original target was 1.026 as noted below. It was just below
that horizontal resistance at 1.0267 which I marked on Fig. 1. Yet,
there's also the longer term trendline marked on both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.
I had 4-5 positions open at the time and this was one of my strongest
two (the other being CAD/JPY short), so I tried to add to my position
once the pair broke that longer term trendline. However, the line proved
to be strong as USD/CHF retraced and took out my stop as shown in Fig. 2
(red dot, 2nd from right). Nevertheless, the pair remained above 1.0200
and my core position was safe (I moved my stop up). But not all was
well. USD/CHF eventually broke 1.025 but it didn't go far. It printed a
couple more bars on the chart while I kept moving my stop closer and
closer. Also noting that the pair was short-term overbought, I moved my
stop right up to below 1.025 at 1.0245 to lock in most of the profit.
That stop was eventually taken out and the pair took a dive as shown in
Fig. 2. Moving the stop up tight in a short-term overbought condition
was a good choice. I learned this from my recent trades when I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdcad-all-out-1-0872-196-6-pips-and-1-0821-145-6-pips/">left
profits on the table</a>. So I got out against my hope for higher pips
even when the talk of USD making a return to strength was ubiquitous. I
traded what I saw and not what I hoped for, and against the opinions of
other people. If only my entry was a bit more patient, this would have
been one of my best executed trades. Below are the data for my entries.
Position size: 100% First Entry: 1.009 First Stop: 1.0030 First Target:
1.0260 Reward / Risk #1 = 170 / 60 = 2.8 \&lt; 3, but close enough. Second
Position Size: 25% Second entry/stop: 1.0232/1.0220 I didn't have a
target in mind for this addition because it was only to add on the
strength of the existing position.</p>
