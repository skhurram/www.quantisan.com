            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Just closed my GBPJPY long at 146.42 for around +140 pips average gain,
or 0.4% in the account balance. Damn good for a 24 hours holding. Obama
just finished his State of The Union address at the moment. I am not
impressed. Still all talk of change but nothing concrete yet. Anyway,
that's beside the point in this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>. 146.50 price level for
GBPJPY is the 10 day moving average. It has also been a strong support
back in late December. This should be a good resistance level. My guess
is that GBPJPY should stall, or even retrace, here for a while. Thus I'm
taking profit at this price as shown in Figure 1 (yellow triangle). I
still believe my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-gbpjpy-144-24-stop-143-60-target-148/">bullish setup from yesterday</a> is still good. So I'll
be watching this pair for a re-entry. Update: I re-entered at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-gbpjpy-145-24-stop-144-70-target-148/">145.24
the next day</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My previous <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-gbpjpy-146-32-target-143/">short-side setup on GBP/JPY</a> played out beautifully. Yet
I wasn't able to ride it down because I got stopped out on a stop-hunt
counter-move before the dive, see Fig. 1. Now that GBP/JPY has reached
its other end. I am betting for it to go reverse with a long position. I
expect this move to be more fierce with more upside potential as it's in
the direction of the long term up trend. Some people are calling the top
has been printed in the markets and the wind is now blowing the other
way. I am not one to guess what the market is about to do. So it's
business as usual until the trendline is broken. What I really like
about this setup is that GBP/JPY is testing a double trendline cross on
the weekly, Fig. 2. Secondly, the 3-hour chart of Figure 1 is showing a
RSI positive divergence on this test of the long term support. I am
quite confident of this setup. However, I am not confident about the
timing as GBP/JPY is known to be a wild horse and volatility could very
well stop me out, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-gbpjpy-146-32-target-143/">like last time</a>. With
British preliminary GDP number coming out in about 6 hours, it might
have been wiser to wait until the after that to enter. On top of that,
the markets have been on a stall for the last few days waiting for data
in the next 48 hours. End-of-week volatility this week is expected to be
significant. Anyway, I've put in a position already and will just let it
run. This a small initial position with 0.1% of my account at risk. I
have also placed limit orders above resistances to add to this position.
We'll how this turns out soon enough. Lastly, even though I said I've
been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/barred-from-trading-at-work-a-curse-or-a-gift/">cut off from trading at my day job</a>. It doesn't mean I'm
completely out of the game. I just have to adapt my manual trading
strategy while my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated system</a> is still in development.
Basically meaning that I'll trade with a slower timeframe for
longer-term moves. All the better, as longer term moves are generally
less deceptive. Update: I closed this at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-gbpjpy-146-42-for-140-pips/">146.42 for +140 pips gain</a>
the next day.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well, they've done it. The IT guys at my day job have blocked access to
streaming market data. I can't trade at lunch anymore or even doodle on
charts! Yet, this event merely pushes my agenda forward as I've never
intended to trade actively at work (i.e. no intention of getting myself
fired). Although I have honestly been pushing my luck these weeks. For
the longest time, I've traded <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/stocks/">stocks</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/options/">options</a>, and even dabbled
in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures</a> (not while at work!). On a whim in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2009/09/">September 2009</a>, I
decided to try out the foreign exchange markets with a demo account just
to see what the fuzz is about. Since then I have not looked back... Nah!
But no, trading stocks still remain my main staple. I am just curious
about forex and it never hurts to broaden my understanding of the
capital market. I must admit though, forex suits my trading style. I
fully intend to incorporate it in my portfolio in the long run. So what
is my plan about forex trading? What do I want to achieve with my
obsessive <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> lately? My paper trading objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">trading weaknesses</a></li>
<li>Identify my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">strengths</a></li>
<li>Experiment with various <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading signals</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">strategies</a></li>
<li>Get a <em>feel</em> of trading the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex market</a></li>
<li>Understand the dynamics between currencies</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd be a fool to claim that I have achieved my objectives. Trading is a
never-ending learning process. This is nothing but the first stage in my
forex trading sojourn. The next stage now, as I have intended from the
beginning, is to automate some trading processes from what I've learned.
Such that I can remain active in the markets even when I am not around.
Not for more profits, but to reduce risks. This need became blatantly
obvious to me as some of my positions were left running through Asia and
early Europe. Profits were sometimes turned into losses. If only my
stops were moved. Fortunately, the vigorous paper trading in the past
few months does have its advantage. It has given me ideas for 3 new
trading systems. I have disclosed one concept with my post on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC
setup</a>. As I was saying, being blocked from trading at work merely
pushes my agenda forward. I haven't touched a single line of code for 5
months. Now I have no choice but to work on developing some
semi-<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading systems</a> to continue my forex paper trading.
My ultimate goal is to let myself do the high-level decision making,
such as which pair to trade, which side of the position, and when. Then
let loose a simple algorithmic trading system to take care of the timing
for entries and exits, and some basic <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex
trading</a> life continues.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I was saying earlier this week, I have been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">stockpiling in EUR/CHF
short</a> in my demo account (Fig. 1). Aside from that, I've also stocked
up some GBP/CHF shorts this week (Fig. 2). Both positions are now closed
because of my adjusted stops. These positions have single-handedly
lifted me half way out of a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/work-harder-trade-fewer-in-a-long-and-excruciating-trading-drawdown/">deep drawdown</a> in my demo account. These
trades netted me about 1.5% in my demo funds. Yes, you read that right,
a meager 1.5% gain and I'm calling these my best trades. No, it's not
like I haven't had <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">good trades</a> in terms of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-eurjpy-135-00-500-1-pips/">money made</a> or the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/eurusd-95-pips-in-2-hours-an-example-of-swing-and-day-trade-convergence/">fastest pips</a>. These shorts aren't even close from just looking at
the numbers. Heck, it would have been a lot more profitable if I shorted
Euro and Pound with a Dollar or Yen counter this week. So why? If you
read my post on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/">measuring trading performance</a>, you may recall that I
don't measure success by profit alone. It is performance <em>in terms of</em>
amount risked that matters in trading. These shorts in EUR/CHF and
GBP/CHF are my best forex trades ever (in my 4 months of fx trading so
far) simply because I risked no more than 0.2% at any given time (most
of the time there were no explicit risk as my stops have locked in
profits) to make that 1.5%. 1.5% gained by risking maximum of 0.2% gives
a Reward/Risk ratio of 1.5/0.2 = 7.5! There were several occasions when
I had doubts to add to my position or were pondering about taking
profits to settle my worries. Despite all of that, I soldiered on,
managed my stops like they were my babies, and piled more into the
position according to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">my plan</a> and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC/">trading setup</a> (Fig. 1). By the time I started scaling out, I have
built my biggest (non-scalp) position. That gave me a lot of freedom in
scaling out as you can see on my exits shown in Figure 1 (red dots).
This Reward/Risk ratio is the highest I have achieved in recent memory.
I have always read about 10x or even 20x trades at the <a href="http://www.smbtraining.com/blog/">SMB Capital
blog</a>. Those guys can achieve this type of reward/risk ratio day in
and day out (I'm not affiliated with them). I guess that's the
difference between the pros and me. This is definitely something I am
strifing to do myself. <strong>Executing consistently high reward/risk
trades.</strong> How I might do that? By continuing to improve on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">trading
skills</a> and my understanding of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex markets</a>. [caption id=""
