            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>
Cascalog is an abstraction library on top of Cascading [for writing
MapReduce jobs][]. Since the Cascalog library is maturing, the Twitter
guys (core committers) have been building features around it so that
it's not just an abstraction for Cascading. One of which is
[Cascalog-checkpoint][]. It is a small, easy-to-use, and very powerful
little add-on for Cascalog. In particular, it enables fault-tolerant
MapReduce topologies. Building Cascading/Cascalog queries can be
visualised as assembling pipes to connect a flow of data. Imagine that
you have Flow A and B. Flow B uses the result from A along with other
bits. Thus, Flow B is dependent on A. Typically, if a MapReduce job fail
for whatever reason, you simply fix what's wrong and start the job all
over again. But what if Flow A takes hours to run (which is common for a
MR job) and the error happened in Flow B? Why re-do all that processing
for Flow A if we know that it finished successfully? By using
Cascalog-checkpoint, you can *stage* intermediate results (e.g. result
of Flow A) and failed jobs can automatically pickup from the last
checked point. An obvious thing to do but not something I've seen done
in Hadoop. At least not as easy as this:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1915638.js?file=ccl-checkpoint-sample1.clj"></script>
See [Sam Ritchie's post on cascalog-checkpoint][] for more examples. Of
course, you need to coerce your flows such that output from Flow A can
be read by Flow B. However, this is almost trivial via
Cascalog/Cascading. As this notion of mix and match pipes and flows is a
fundamental concept in Cascalog/Cascading. With so many choices of
abstraction frameworks for coding MapReduce on Hadoop, I feel sorry for
anyone using vanilla Java for writing MapReduce besides the most
simplest or recurring jobs.

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Cascalog makes it a lot simpler to build distributed strategy
backtesters on terabytes of market data, for example. It is a data
processing library for building MapReduce jobs. I've been spiking out a
data processing project with it at work for the past couple of weeks. So
I thought I might as well give a lightning talk about it at our monthly
developers meetup. Here are my presentation slides introducing Cascalog
and outlining its features.</p>

Hadoop on CentOS 5 working. I'm more of an Ubuntu guy, so CentOS is a

exception about the java heap space. I couldn't find a solution online
so I just bumped up the memory on the virtual machine and it solved the
problem. In any case, I managed to run <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module3.html#vm-jobs">the pi calculation example</a> on

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Testing is arguably the single most important aspect of trading system
development. You can't tell how well an idea works unless you test it
out. [Testing can also help you identify weaknesses or strengths in your
model][]. The downside to testing is that it takes time to churn through
those gigabytes of data. Backtesting is inherently a linear process. You
feed in your tick data into your algorithm and expect some actions. You
can't really make use of fork/join to let other threads steal from the
process queue as the later process depends on results from the earlier
calculations. However, often times than not, you're interested in
testing many variations of a strategy. This is where MapReduce comes
into play. MapReduce is a Google software framework. It is inspired by
the map and reduce functions ubiquitous in functional programming. They
are as common as for-loops in the Java world. The <em>map</em> function
partitions an input into smaller problems and run them concurrently,
e.g. each of the strategy's variant is executed on a node. The <em>reduce</em>
function takes the results from all the nodes and aggregate them to get
an output, e.g. back-test results from each strategy. Having used
functional programming for some time now, using map/reduce is very
natural for me. Where my knowledge falls short is in implementing a
distributed infrastructure for running these map and reduce with massive
scaling beyond my own multi-core computer. It just so happens that
Amazon AWS has a hosted Hadoop PaaS. Where Hadoop is the Apache's
framework for MapReduce. Hardware, check. Framework, check. This will be
the ~~first~~ second system that I'll be working on in my goal to build
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/towards-a-broker-agnostic-trading-system/">a complete trading R&amp;D platform</a>. Expect some technical discussions
in the coming months as I work my way through. Now, where should I
start...</p>
