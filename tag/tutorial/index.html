            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been looking for a cheap but reliable virtual private server (VPS)
to run my trading program for the last few months. I ran my QTD program
on 3 remote servers in UK and Germany in April for an entire month as
performance testing. One in UK on a Xen cloud. One in Germany on OpenVZ.
And a last one also in UK on KVM technology. This post is a summary of
my initial findings on what to watch for when choosing a server provider
for running a remote trading server. Keep in mind that this is for
low-end, low-frequency, retail trading. Where latencies in the range of
tens of milliseconds are considered good. General target price range is
US\$10 - \$20 per month for an unmanaged server with 512MB of ram and
600MHz-equivalent of circa 2006 Intel CPU. Low price is the primary
consideration here. If you don't care for the technical details, the top
VPS names are <a href="http://www.linode.com">Linode</a>, <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en/">Hetzner</a>, and <a href="http://www.6sync.com">6sync</a> for Linux-based
VPSs. Linode offers Xen VPSs in US and UK. 6sync offers KVM VPSs in US
only. Both companies offer Linux-based 512MB instances for \$20 as a
starter server. Hetzner offers KVM VPSs in Germany for â‚¬7.90. Cloud
servers like Amazon EC2 and Rackspace Cloud are too expensive for
running 24/7.</p>
<h2>Location, Location, Location</h2>
<p>Use a datacenter that's at least in the same sub-continent as your
broker's datacenter. You wouldn't want your data to travel half-way
around the world just to save a few bucks. It adds unnecessary latency
and prices are comparable in either the states or Europe nowadays.
Although Asia is another story. If you use more than one broker, you can
use multiple servers or pick a server location that sits between them on
the internet backbone. TeleGeography provides <a href="http://www.telegeography.com/telecom-resources/map-gallery/index.html">global internet maps</a>
to identify best locations. I trade with Dukascopy and Oanda. One in
Switzerland and another in the states. As such, Internet hubs in cities
like New York, London, and Frankfurt are prime targets for low latency
between both brokers. As I trade more at Dukascopy, I'm biased to
European servers. Furthermore, London and Frankfurt are the #1 and #2
internet hub in the world. London has 7,723 Gbps and Frankfurt has 7,218
Gbps capacity in 2010. Whereas New York, 5th in the world, has 3,850
Gbps.</p>
<h2>Virtualization Technologies</h2>
<p>Virtual private servers are merely reserved resource chunks of a
computer in a datacenter. This is achieved through the use of
virtualization technologies. And there are quite many of those as I have
discovered. Here are three that you'll likely hear about in your search.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>OpenVZ.</strong> This is the most popular and least preferred platform
    for trading servers. It's often used by budget hosts because
    resources between virtualized instances are not well isolated. As
    such, a host can oversell a server's resource as most webapps have
    sporadic resource utilization trend. In other worlds, it is unlikely
    all the virtual private servers would demand their maximum allocated
    resources at the same time. However, trading servers require a
    consistent and guaranteed level of computing resource. So stay away
    from VPS that runs on OpenVZ unless you want to see server hiccups.</li>
<li><strong>Xen.</strong> This is what Amazon EC2 and Rackspace Cloud runs on. Xen
    offers true resource isolation so that you're less likely affected
    by your virtual server's neighbours. What you see is also what you
    get. So if you're promised 512MB of memory, you'll get 512MB of
    memory. However, processing power varies tremendously across
    different VPS providers. A micro instance on Amazon EC2 offers 613MB
    of memory, for example. But it is no match for even a 256MB instance
    on Rackspace Cloud. I was able to run a LXDE desktop GUI plus a java
    program on Rackspace but couldn't do it on Amazon.</li>
<li><strong>KVM.</strong> KVM uses the Linux kernel to virtualize. It's said to offer
    lower overhead to the host server so that it can provide better
    value than Xen. Like Xen, it offers true resource isolation.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, either Xen or KVM are good but stay away from OpenVZ.</p>
<h2>Operating System</h2>
<p>Key question here is: Linux or Windows? If you're unfamiliar with Linux
and is not interesting in learning about it, use a Windows Server 2003
or 2008 provider. Windows Server 2003 is preferred as it uses fewer
resources just to run so it's cheaper. Do note that Windows VPSs are
\$10-\$20 more expensive anyway because you have to pay for a monthly
license lease. With the use of a Windows-based VPS, you can connect to
your server through the remote desktop protocol (RDP). It's just a
matter of running the Remote Desktop application on your local machine
to your remote server. Then you'll see the remote machine's desktop on
your own machine. And then you can control the remote server just like
any other Windows computer. Very simple. However, I prefer to run Linux
because of its renowned stability and lower cost. The downside is that
you need to know what you're doing to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">tweak the server for trading</a>.
Linux uses very little computing resource to run. I can squeeze JForex
and Metatrader together on a Linux VPS with only 256MB memory. By
comparison, you need at least 512MB on a Windows box just to get the OS
running. And there's no licensing fee for Linux too. A double savings.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>When choosing a VPS provider, consider factors such as location,
virtualization technology, and operating system(s) offered. Once you've
narrowed your search to a shortlist of providers, the next step is to
compare their specific VPS offerings by looking at price, services, and
technical specifications.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Having studied the anatomy of an empty JForex strategy (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/anatomy-of-a-jforex-strategy-part-1/">Part 1</a> and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/anatomy-of-a-jforex-strategy-part-2/">Part 2</a>), it's time to dissect a working one. MA_Play is the
strategy that is included with every JForex API download as a
demonstration. You can find the complete source code of this strategy in
/src/singlejartest/ in the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/forex/jforex/library/">JForex API zipped package</a>. Recall that
the first Interface method which runs at the start of the strategy is
onStart. The onStart method of MA_Play is reproduced below. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">onStart</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">IContext</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="n">JFException</span> <span class="o">{</span> 
    <span class="n">engine</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getEngine</span><span class="o">();</span> 
    <span class="n">indicators</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getIndicators</span><span class="o">();</span>

<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The variables <code>engine</code>, <code>indicators</code>, and <code>console</code> are <em>fields</em> of the MA_Play class. They are
global variables within the class. What lines 42--44 do is to save the
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=IEngine">IEngine</a>, <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=IIndicators">IIndicators</a>, and <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=IConsole">IConsole</a> objects for later use.</p>
<p>The last line of onStart, line 45, is merely to <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Console">print a message on your
JForex program console</a> to notify the user that the strategy has
started.</p>
<p>Once onStart is finished processing, the server is likely to
call onTick if a market tick arrives. If it's not during market hours,
then there's no tick and some other event might happen instead of
onTick. Think of the methods as events rather than a linear process. You
program your JForex strategy according to what you want to do with each
of the six IStrategy Interface event. </p>
<p>For this particular strategy, the
programmer decides to implement their strategy at the tick level. As
such, much of the trading algorithm resides in onTick for MA_Play. Note
that this is a design choice, you can use onBar if you want your
strategy to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/anatomy-of-a-jforex-strategy-part-2/">process at the bar level</a> (or you can use both
onTick and onBar).</p>
<p>Here's the source code for onTick in MA_Play. </p>

<p>At a glance, you may notice that the variables <code>ma0</code> and <code>ma1</code> play a key role in
determining the setup. <strong>Hint:</strong> To reverse engineer a strategy, it may
be easier to work backward from when the order is placed, which is done
by <code>engine.submitOrder</code> in this case. </p>
<p><code>ma0</code> and <code>ma1</code> hold results from exponential moving averages (EMA). <code>ma0</code> is the current value. <code>ma1</code> is
the previous bar's value. Lines 56--63 check using IF tests (lines 56
and 60) to see if either of the variables hold invalid data. If the data
is invalid, the indicator is calculated and the rest of the onTick is
skipped with the <code>return</code> statement on line 62.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Indicator values can sometimes be invalid (zero, negative, or <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html">Double.NaN</a>,
depending on the particular indicator implementation) if there is
insufficient data to calculate it or an error occurred, for examples.</p>
<p>The EMAs are fetched in lines 57 and 59 using the IIndicators object
(which was initialized in onStart). The <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Indicators">JForex Wiki provides an
explanation of its use</a>. </p>
<p>Notice that <code>ma1</code> is an array, which was
declared in line 38 with a size equivalent to the number of <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/com/dukascopy/api/Instrument.html">all
available JForex instruments</a>. In particular, it is used with a
special index value as in <code>ma1[instrument.ordinal()]</code>. In other words,
it is asking for the current instrument's slot in the <code>ma1</code> array. The
current instrument is the one that is passed into the method in line 55.</p>
<p>Moving down the code, another point of interest is line 65, showing the
use of <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/com/dukascopy/api/Instrument.html#getPipValue()">instrument.getPipValue(</a>). Line 67 checks if the current total
number of position is zero. If it is, meaning no opened position, then
the strategy proceeds to check the entry signal to enter a trade (lines
68--76). </p>
<p><code>positionsTotal()</code> is a custom method defined in lines 84--92.
It uses a FOR loop to cycle through all the orders obtained from
[<code>engine.getOrders(instrument)</code>][] </p>
<p>Once either of the long or short
condition, lines 68 and 72, respectively, is met, the strategy submits
an order in lines 69 for a short and line 73 for a long. The
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Set_Market_Order">particulars of submitting market orders</a> is described in the JForex
Wiki. </p>
<p>When you stop this strategy, onStop (lines 48--53) is called. For
this strategy, the programmer loops through all the orders again using
<code>engine.getOrders()</code> and closes each of the position with an
[<code>order.close()</code>][] command in line 50. </p>
<p>That is it for this trivial
strategy. If there is one point that you should remember. Note my use of
the many links to the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/">JForex javadoc</a> and <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">JForex Wiki</a> throughout
this post. You are likely to find many of your answers from those two
sources. If not, there's always the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/forex/jforex/forum/">JForex Support Board</a>. Now that
you've had an idea of how MA_Play.java works, it's time to test it. In
the next post in January, we will discuss the JForex Historical Tester
and what to watch for when running a strategy live.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>We looked at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/anatomy-of-a-jforex-strategy-part-1/">four of the six methods in the IStrategy Interface</a> in a
previous post. The last two methods, onTick and onBar, is where your
strategy connect with market data. Either one, or both, of these methods
is where you put your trading algorithm in. Your strategy would then be
able to process the market data as they arrive one tick/bar at a time.
Recall that IStrategy Interface is the skeleton of your strategy. And
that IContext object is the heart of your strategy. onTick/onBar is the
head of your strategy, which contains your trading algorithm, which is
the brain.</p>
<h2>onTick</h2>
<p>Here's the method definition of onTick. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">onTick</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Instrument</span> <span class="n">instrument</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">ITick</span> <span class="n">tick</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="n">JFException</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Important:</strong>onTick is called for each and every instrument that your
JForex platform is subscribed to (the instrument list in your workspace
box). Let me say that again, onTick is called for each and every
instrument that your JForex platform is subscribed to. The standard
practice is to <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Filter_Ticks/Bars">filter out ticks</a> for instruments that you don't want
with a simple IF-return statement.
<code>if (instrument != myInstrument) return;</code> Actual tick data is passed to
your strategy using the ITick object from the onTick method's parameter.
Take a look at the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/com/dukascopy/api/ITick.html">ITick javadoc entry</a> to see what it offers.</p>
<h2>onBar</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">onBar</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Instrument</span> <span class="n">instrument</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Period</span> <span class="n">period</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">IBar</span> <span class="n">askBar</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">IBar</span> <span class="n">bidBar</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="n">JFException</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>onBar works in a similar manner to onTick. In which onBar is called for each
and every subsribed instrument <em>and period</em> known to JForex. Similarly,
you have to <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Filter_Ticks/Bars">filter out all the unwanted instruments and periods</a> or else there will be expected results from your strategy.
Another point to note is that onBar provides both a <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/com/dukascopy/api/IBar.html">IBar</a> askBar and
IBar bidBar, representing the ask and bid bars. <strong>Question:</strong> What
happens when two or more periods overlap as in 13:45? 1, 5, and
15-minutes bars are all arriving at the same time (not to mention the
periods in seconds too). <strong>Answer:</strong> According to Dukascopy Support in
the forum, "They come in a strict order, for example (1min 1min 1min
1min 1min 5min 1min 1min 1min 1min 1min 5min ..) They come in cycles,
where <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/forex/jforex/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=23959">smaller periods comes first</a>."</p>
<h2>JForex Support Forum</h2>
<p>As you program your strategy with JForex, you will no doubt come up with
questions of your own. The best place to ask is at the official <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/forex/jforex/forum/">JForex
Support Forum</a>. This is the last of the three essential JForex
resources that I alluded to earlier. Even if you don't have any specific
question, there are sample codes, coding discussion, and hundreds of
existing Q&amp;A from other JForex developers posted in the forum.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The discussion so far has been very high level. To show you what you can
actually <em>do</em> in an IStrategy, we will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/dissecting-a-jforex-strategy-ma_play-java/">dissect a working strategy in
the next post</a>. And what else better to examine than the most popular
JForex strategy of them all -- MA_Play.java.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Continuing on from Part 1 of this series: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/getting-started-learning-jforex-programming/">Getting started learning
JForex programming</a>, now we're ready to discuss the real thing. You
build JForex strategies by using the IStrategy Interface (<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html">What is an
Interface?</a>). Basically, an Interface is a code skeleton with a set of
predefined empty methods that you'll need to implement yourself. The six
standard methods of the IStrategy Interface are:</p>
<ol>
<li>onStart</li>
<li>onStop</li>
<li>onMessage</li>
<li>onAccount</li>
<li>onTick</li>
<li>onBar</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is an empty IStrategy Interface implementation, also known as a
JForex strategy. This code will compile fine in JForex and you can even
run it. But it doesn't do anything at all because there is no code to
run in each of the methods. Each of the six methods will just be called
and exit immediately.</p>

<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Each of the method is triggered by a specific event. You can probably
guess what they are from their name.</p>
<h2>onStart (line 5)</h2>
<p>This is the first method that is called when you run your strategy. It
will run once and only once at the start of your strategy. Normally you
do your initialization in here. The thing to note for onStart is in line
5 of the code. The method signature of onStart is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">onStart</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">IContext</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="n">JFException</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The object
in the parameter and given to you in this method is an IContext object.
If IStrategy is the skeleton, then IContext is the heart of the
strategy. Please take a look at this <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/com/dukascopy/api/IContext.html">javadoc link to IContext</a> to see
what this object does. <strong>Javadoc?</strong>: Now is a good time to introduce the
second of the three essential resources of a JForex programmer. The
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/">JForex Javadoc</a> is the single most up-to-date API documentation
<em>explaining</em> each and every object and methods of the JForex API. Think
of it like a reference manual. Note that although it's comprehensive,
most of the explanation is very sparse and possibly incomplete. IContext
is a core JForex object to access many important components of the
JForex system, such as the ordering engine, charts, console,
indicators... You get the idea. It is important! You typically want to
keep a local copy of it as this is the only time (in onStart) that this
object will be passed to you in IStrategy.</p>
<h2>onStop (line 26)</h2>
<p>As the name suggest, this method is called once you send a stop command
to your strategy. You do your program wrap-up such as logging and
flushing data here. Not much out of the ordinary with this one.</p>
<h2>onMessage (line 18)</h2>
<p>Whereas we know when onStart and onStop will be called, onMessage is an
asynchronous method in that you don't know exactly when it will run.
This method is called when the Dukascopy server sends your strategy a
message. For example, the server calls onMessage to let you know that
your order has been filled. You receive and process the server message
by accessing the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/com/dukascopy/api/IMessage.html">IMessage object</a> that is passed to you.
<strong>Important:</strong>There is no guarantee that you will receive each and every
message sent to your strategy from the server. Perhaps your strategy
process is clogged. Or maybe your internet connection had a hiccup. If
your strategy onMessage doesn't get called by the server for whatever
reason, the server couldn't care less and won't be checking nor trying
again. So don't do anything critical like managing your orders in
onMessage!</p>
<h2>onAccount (line 22)</h2>
<p>This method is called whenever your account information update is
received. The method provides access to the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/com/dukascopy/api/IAccount.html">IAccount object</a>, which
you use to get your account information. Say if you have an open
position, your account information changes on every tick because your
equity is cash + unrealized profit/loss. In that case, onAccount is
called every 5 seconds by the server at most to avoid flooding your
strategy. <strong>More Important:</strong>The IAccount object is not connected live
to your account in the server. It is merely a snapshot of your account.
For example, if you keep a local copy of an IAccount object. Do some
trading to change your balance. Then ask the same IAccount for account
balance information, you will not see a change. As such, always update
your local copy of IAccount within the onAccount method to keep your
account information up-to-date for your strategy's use.</p>
<h2>To be continued</h2>
<p>onStart, onStop, onMessage, and onAccount methods are <em>administrative</em>
methods for your strategy. The last two methods that we'll discuss,
onTick and onBar, is where the magic happens in a strategy. I am saving
the best for last in the next post.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The biggest problem I had when learning to program my own trading
strategies in JForex is finding where to start learning. There were few
JForex documentation available at the time and I had to teach myself
through painstaking trial and error with the help of Dukascopy's
technical support. Things have certainly changed for the better as a
JForex community is starting to sprout and documentation for it is at
least sufficient to get anyone started. This post is the first of a
series of quick beginner's guide to learning JForex programming by
putting all these resources in a tutorial.</p>
<h2>JForex is a Java tool</h2>
<p>JForex is actually not a programming language. It is an application
programming interface (API) for use with the standard Java programming
language. As such, the first step to learning to program in JForex is to
learn Java. Luckily, Java is one of the most popular programming
languages. So there're plenty of resources on and off the web to learn
Java programming. Some examples of free online tutorials are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/">The Java Tutorials</a> -- This is an official tutorial from the
    developer of Java themselves. Highly recommended.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.roseindia.net/java/beginners/">Beginners Java Tutorial</a> -- More geared for the absolute
    beginners to programming.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you prefer a book, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596009208?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=quantisan-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596009208">Head First Java, 2nd
Edition</a>. I brushed up on my Java from this book. Don't dwell on
Java too much though as you only need to know the basics to get started
with JForex. Just read a few chapters to understand the Java syntax and
then move on. You can always refer back to them later.</p>
<h2>Diving into JForex</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">JForex Wiki</a> is one of the three essential resources for JForex
programmers. I will be referring to some specific pages of the Wiki in
much of this series of posts. If you haven't done so already, <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">signup
for a DEMO account at Dukascopy</a>. Then launch the JForex platform and
follow the instructions on the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Use_in_JForex">Use in JForex</a> wiki page to assemble
your first JForex strategy!</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>So far so good? By this point, I hope you can understand basic Java
source code and know how to start/open, compile, and run a JForex
strategy. In the next post in this learning JForex series, we will
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/anatomy-of-a-jforex-strategy-part-1/">study the anatomy of a JForex strategy</a>.</p>
