            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>No, I haven't unloaded my GS short yet. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-gs-100-apr-09-105-put-872/">I said I would unload it if GS
manage to stay above \$110</a>. But it closed at \$110.60 yesterday. I
can live with a \$0.60 difference.</p>
<p>I watched GS for most of the day yesterday. It's action above \$110 seem
a bit lackluster. Looking at the chart, particularly the daily, you can
see the sword-like candlestick from yesterday. There's probably a name
for it, but I don't remember. Add to that, S&amp;P500 just tested 820
resistance yesterday.</p>
<p>GS's move above \$110 is certainly interesting. The correct play would
be for it to break below \$110 and then observe the pullback, then if
it's weak, that would have been the right time to pound on the short
selling button. Or we could just buy a strangle at this point...</p>
<p>Since I entered pre-maturely on Monday, I'm going to wait this out
because the risk/reward ratio is still very high. At least now I know
\$115 would be my stop and my potential loss.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Once again, I find myself on the other side of the fence. I entered a
short at 10:42am today thinking the gap up is unsustainable. Well, not
only has S&amp;P500 broken 800, it's now resting above 820. Goldman Sachs
(GS) was about 106.50 when I entered the short. GS closed at 111.93
today. I'm down \$210 already. If GS can stay above this 200 day MA at
\$110 later tomorrow, then I'm out.</p>

<p>As you can see, GS went vertical upward once it broke the morning
resistance at \$17.30. The reason for my entry in the morning was
because GS seemed like it was having difficulty breaking \$17.
Furthermore, S&amp;P 500 also seemed hesitant around 800. So I guessed it'd
be reasonable to see a pullback.</p>
<p>However, I failed to take into account today's humongous gap up open. It
would have been counter-productive if we're to close the gap on the
weekend's hype up. This is pretty much a reverse of what we've seen
seeing for the past few months. Panic begets panic. But in today's case,
it's panic of missing the rally train that'll fuel this possibly new leg
of a rally.</p>
<p>My second mistake is trading on lack of information. I traded using the
mobile platform and by just looking at the Google Finance charts. If I
had access to my intraday sentiment chart, I could have easily seen that
the morning momentum remained strong even when S&amp;P was stalling around
800.</p>
<p>Lastly, I really should stick to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/market%20analysis/">my own analysis</a> and not trade on a
spontaneous urge. I did say in the morning that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/beginning-of-another-bull-phase-asian-markets-are-on-fire/">we'll break down if we
fail to maintain 800</a>. Even at the time of my short entry, we were
indeed holding on to the 800 zone. Thus, I have basically shot myself in
the foot for not listening to myself.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Last week's market reacted as planned. We held the S&amp;P500 680 support
level on Monday and shot up from there throughout the week. This <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-weekly-review-march-7-2009/">750 -
800 level as discussed before</a> could form a trading range for the next
few days. However, note that both the S&amp;P index and Goldman Sachs (GS)
are testing the downtrend resistance at 800 and 100 respectively. GS in
particular failed to reach 100 again on declining daily volume. This is
a pretty bad sign. (JPM, C, and BAC looks similar to GS, in that they
are showing a short term double top)</p>
<p>If we fail to keep this momentum going up, I see a pullback to 720 to be
very possible. And if we're to fail to keep the 720 support, 670 would
be next, and then 600 as I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-weekly-review-march-7-2009/">suggested in last week's review</a>.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the reason I'm using GS in particular as a leading
indicator is because we're, obviously, in a financial crisis, so like a
house of cards, the [market is only as strong as the weakest link in
these troubled times][].</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've nearly pulled the trigger today on adding some shorts. Then I
decided against it because there's no action in the market and no good
confirmation. My 50% long, 25% short, and 25% cash distribution seems
alright for now. But Figure 1 below leads me to want to add more to the
short side.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 1, the market is still clearly in a downtrend.
Moreover, we are at the top end of the channel. So shorting at this
point has a good risk/reward ratio.</p>

<p>In particular, Goldman Sachs in Figure 2 seems like a decent play.</p>

<p>But as I was saying, I'd rather wait for GS to break the triangle first
before making a move. With the current market, it's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/auto-bailout-shakeout-december-13-2008/">better to be late
than early</a>.</p> </div>
