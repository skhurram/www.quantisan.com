            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After watching the videos below, and from months of observation of this
latest global financial debacle, I am suddenly awashed with a feeling of
hopelessly powerless to this gross unfairness. In which the average,
hard working citizens are pouring money into the pockets of the filthy
and uber rich. If you don't know what I'm talking about here, watch the
video attached below for the tip of the ice berg in this on-going
problem. While Goldman is arguably the best at "legalized stealing" from
the moms and pops, they aren't the only crook on the block. Governments
around the world (not just the U.S.) were handing out money publicly
left and right in the past few months. And many still are. The whole
system is rigged as <a href="http://www.caracommunity.com">Bill Cara</a> has opined countless times in the last
few years. Bill's ingenious move to relocate his operation to the
Bahamas is only starting to shine in these months (to me). In addition
to voting with your ballot (which is useless if the whole system is
rigged), we can vote with our tax money by relocating our financial
operation. However, for those of us that still rely on a day job, this
is not an option. The best I can do right now is to become adequate with
managing our own money instead of depending on the financial salesmen.
This doesn't seem enough for me as the balance of power appears to be
getting worse by the day. Our government grossly tax us on one hand and
hand them out to the rich and well connected in the other. What have
others done/plan to do with regard to this unfair trap us working bees
are stuck in? The first video is Ratigan explaining how Goldman Sachs
made \$3 billions in 3 months (tipped by Stop Investing blog). The
second video is an interview with Michael Moore and Ratigan about where
all these loots are going now.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Despite <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/end-of-month-review-march-is-bear-rally-month/">my pessimism</a>, I think this bear rally may have steam to go
even farther up in this run before the final flush down. Here're my
reasons.</p>
<p>​1. We have touched the 38% Fibonacci retracement level precisely last
week and have been making higher lows. See Figure 1.</p>
<p>​2. As I noted in the morning, the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/end-of-month-review-march-is-bear-rally-month/">up days have noticeably more volumes
than the down days</a> in this rally.</p>
<p>​3. My two favourite shorts, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">GE</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-gs-100-apr-09-105-put-955/">GS</a>, are resisting to stay
below their supports. In particular, Figure 2 shows that even in today's
swinging moves, they closed above their intra-day supports at noon while
the S&amp;P 500 broke its intraday support at noon, just barely. In fact,
today's move look a lot like <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-277-tck-487/">TCK when it retraced</a> (and when I
unloaded), just to punch through to much higher later. If that's any
indication, these two (and the market) will be breaking their long term
resistances within days.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm out of GS short, which I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-gs-100-apr-09-105-put-872/">bought at 8.72</a>, with a small profit.
This gap down today only attracted some light volume. And we're hitting
the support of \$100. Light volume on a test of a strong support isn't
good. So I'm lightening my short here since I still have my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">GE
strangle</a> to live off of in case we're tanking further as I suspect.
Call me chicken, but <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/goldman-sachs-is-it-up-or-is-it-down/">this position is a bit too heavy</a> to be
comfortable.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After much waiting, Goldman Sachs (GS) is still not giving up the \$110
level. I entered my short on Monday when GS was about \$106.50. [Having
regretted it that very day as GS launched vertical upward near the close
to above \$110][]. Then yesterday, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/goldman-sachs-fooling-around-110/">GS threw a fit and made wild swings
up and down</a>, only to close near its open. Today, GS retraced more but
managed to crawl its way out of a hole back to \$112.95. Just above the
support of \$110, again.</p>
<p>After a historic 7% a day rally on Monday, this shallow pullback of both
GS and the broad market is a textbook bullish signal staring me in the
face. I can't help but feel we're going to explode upward soon. This
could very well be [THE full-blown, back-up-the-cash-truck bear rally
I've been expecting all year][]. And yet, I'm net short in my portfolio
...</p>
<p>I honestly wanted to get out of this short today and go long. As I was
saying in the last update, I've marked my mental stop at \$115, its
recent peak. But we never saw that price again. So even though
emotionally I want out, I don't have a logical reason to ditch and
switch yet. So, the waiting game continues.</p>
