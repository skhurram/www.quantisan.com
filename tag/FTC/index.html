            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I entered CADJPY long at market for 86.88 just now. This is a
continuation of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-usdcad-short-1-0540-for-131-pips/">previous USDCAD short</a> position. However, USDJPY
is on a run upward so I'm switching to go long on the loonie with yen
instead. Figure 1 shows the daily chart of CADJPY. Notice the imminent
MACD bullish crossover and the already in-play stochastic upturn. I like
it. My stop loss level is set at 86.10. It's the high of a previous peak
on February 3, two weeks ago. My target is the round number 88
resistance. 88.0 has been an important price level for CADJPY for the
past few months. So I'm setting my sight there.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="CADJPY,
daily"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-02-17-cadjpy_d.gif" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows my timing for this entry. CADJPY is noticeably meeting
some resistance at 87.50. 87.50 is also the 61.8% Fibonacci level of a
recent down move. This is a cause for concern on my long position as we
could very well retrace here. However, the bullishness of CADJPY is
apparent in Figure 2. Prices have consistently been bought for the past
few days right on the short term moving average (teal line).
Furthermore, the intermediate term moving average (orange line) is about
to cross the long term moving average (red line) as I enter this
position.</p>
<p>Lastly, gold price has taken a dive from 1130 to 1100. Meanwhile, crude
oil price is holding the 77 support nicely. Thus, this confirm my
previous view that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-change-of-wind-for-australian-dollar-shorted-audusd-0-9183-and-audcad-0-9546/">oil has better upside than gold</a> in the
intermediate term. Which is why I've been trading the loonie these past
weeks.</p>
<p>For this particular CADJPY trade, I have another buy order waiting above
current support level to add to my long position. Let's see if CADJPY
can break decisively to the upside in the next 24 hours as US and
Canadian data comes out.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Perhaps third times' the charm? I tried to short USDCAD twice last week
already. Both times I've been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-out-of-usdcad-short-1-0640-for-67-pips-re-entering-1-0680/">stopped out</a> for a total of -0.2% of
account loss. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">intermediate term analysis</a> remains the same as
before. So I won't repeat myself here. Entry signal for this particular
short is shown in Figure 1. I'm just using the 4-hour chart as I have a
well defined (recent top) stop this time. I compensate with a smaller
position size to limit my risk to 0.1%. Reward / Risk = (1.05761 -
1.0671) / (1.0671 - 1.0756) = 1.11 [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well this was awful. USDCAD continued on a rampage upward and I was
caught on the wrong side of the fence. Total loss for this was 0.12% of
my account. At least I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">was light in it</a>. In retrospect, I broke my
own rule and didn't enter at one of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">4 fundamental entry points</a>.
However, after some bear rampage throughout the markets today
(Bloomberg: [Stocks Plunge on Concern Rising Debt, Job Losses Threaten
Global Recovery][]), USDCAD is at the top of my channel as shown in
Figure 1 below. So while my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">previous entry</a>
was early. USDCAD at this price is a good short. I will take it slow
this time by setting a limit order below current support on the 4-hour
at 1.0680, with a stop at 1.0750. And then adding a second chunk at
1.0640, my stopped out price. As is customarily lately, I am only
risking 0.1% of my account on the initial order. On a weekly chart,
1.0750 to 1.0810 is obviously a strong resistance for the USDCAD. It is
a congestion zone in 2007 and 2008. Then USDCAD spent the last quarter
of 2009 trying to break this resistance to no avail. But who knows,
perhaps USDCAD has had enough and it will break this resistance
decisively soon. That's why I'm only betting on this reversal with
limited risk. It's just a matter of wait and see now.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Taking a first position in USD/CAD short here at 1.0573 on a 4-hour
moving averages cross-over (Figure 1). I've also placed a limit order to
add more at 1.0519 below Fibonacci support (shown in Figure 1). Reason
for this trade is that USD/CAD is moving away from an upper bound
channel with a overbought stochastic reading, as shown in the daily
chart of Figure 2. I've also considered going long AUD/USD, but AUD/CAD
trend remains bearish. So I chose to short USD/CAD instead. Secondly,
crude oil (and gold too) looks to be bouncing off an oversold level with
a rapid move in 2 days from 72.43 to 77.39. Coincidentally, INO.com
posted an intermediate term <a href="http://www.ino.com/info/513/CD4184/&amp;dp=0&amp;l=0&amp;campaignid=3">cyclical analysis video with a bullish
outlook</a> (affiliate link). They put out a better case than I do.
USD/CAD might make a short-term upward bounce here because of a
short-term oversold condition. However, there's evidently a lack of
buyers in the past few hours (Fig. 1). The price has been sitting on
support a bit too long in my view. Thus, I'm expecting it to break
without a meaningful retracement (hence the short entry). A confirmation
would be a break below 1.0530. Thus I have a limit order to short more
below that price. I am risking 0.1% of my account on this trade. As you
may have noticed, these charts are from Metatrader. I'm switching over
to the MT4 platform as of today. Having played with its charting
features for the past few hours, I'm quite satisfied with it so far.
Although my needs are low as I was fine with the Oanda platform too
(arguably the most simplistic platform out there). [caption id=""
