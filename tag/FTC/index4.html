            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Several major pairs are testing their support on this market correction
with a 20 points drop in the S&amp;P500 before 10 am. This is a short term
capitulation scenario. From looking at the major pairs, the long term
trend still seem to be intact. In particular, I am interested in
shorting Yen because I'm seeing <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC setups</a> across the board in JPY
crosses. I compared AUD/JPY, CAD/JPY, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, and USD/JPY
pairs to decide which one to go long with. Seeing that I already have a
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-0122-sl-1-0060-tp-1-0225/">USD/CHF long position</a>, USD/JPY is out. Then EUR/JPY is out too
because of recent Euro weakness from my observations of intraday price
actions. I haven't had much luck with British Pounds, so GBP/JPY is out
too. That leaves me with my two favourites, CAD/JPY and AUD/JPY. So I
checked with USD/CAD and AUD/USD charts to see which has better
support/resistance. USD/CAD has a lot of resistance above 1.06, so going
with CAD/JPY long seem like to be less risky. However, from looking at
the 3-hour chart, I changed my mind to go with AUD/JPY long because it
is showing a positive divergence there. From the daily chart of AUD/JPY
shown in Figure 1, we can see that the up-trend is losing steam. The
price action is expected to be choppy. Long term condition, up and
choppy. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"

3-hour chart of AUD/JPY, this is where things get more clear. Notice
that AUD/JPY is testing the lower fChannel the third time in a month
with the lowest RSI. This is a clear positive divergence. [caption id=""

down move is making this long entry very dangerous. Thus, I am using the
NYSE intraday sentiment (Fig. 3) to pin point my entry. Notice the
extreme negative open and then the intraday positive divergence as shown
by the S&amp;P500 and TICK. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500"

intraday sentiment</a>[/caption] As part of my analysis for this trade, I
compared the current scenario with earlier this month. Figure 4 is the
hourly chart of AUD/JPY when I entered this trade. Figure 5 is the
hourly chart of AUD/JPY from Nov 1st - 4th, when AUD/JPY last tested the
lower fChannel. I noticed that AUD/JPY had a tendency to break below my
fChannel by about 50 pips before reversing. With the fChannel at 81.80
today, AUD/JPY should fall to 81.30. I watched that level closely this
morning and timed my entry with the intraday sentiment as described
above. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="AUD/JPY,

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Having had <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-bad-eurusd-day-trading-and-what-to-do-about-it/">a hard time day trading the EUR/USD last week</a>, things
haven't been well for me this week either with the market in a gridlock.
My one and only viable setup so far is <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">built for a trending market</a>.
So this range-bound market is new territory for me as I experiment (in
hindsight, haphazardly) to come up with more profitable forex trading
setups. As you can imagine, trading without discipline is a recipe for
diaster. I have given back all the paper gain from this month by the
start of this week and is treading on thin ice with my demo account
dipping dangerously close to the November opening balance. Needless to
say, I do not want to see my account in the red for this month. But that
is what happened after today's string of failed trades. I am officially
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">in the red for this month</a>, for now. While there are several mistakes
I made resulting in this mess, I think it all boils down to one flaw in
my trading this week. Yes, those day trading stints I did surely have
put a dent in my demo account, but what's worse is that I've
unconsciously have let those losses affect my trading mentality. These
losses were stuck in my mind and my mental "goal" for this week was
recovering from them. However, I have approached the problem in the
wrong way by not wanting to lose anymore in my account. In other words,
I was afraid of losing. So how did that materially affect my trading?
Here is a simple example as illustrated in my order history on the
GBP/JPY chart attached at the bottom of this post. The 3 yellow
triangles are my short entries and the 3 red dots marks the stopped
exits. According to my setup, my original entry at 149.50 had a stop at
150.50. But I moved my stop closer to 149.80 in the morning because I
didn't want to risk more. That got taken out easily as 149.80 is within
the congestion zone. Then I tried to short it a couple more times with
tight stops because I see the downside potential to be still intact.
Those were eaten up alive too and now I don't have a position because it
would have been more foolish to keep trying in vain. While just 3 trades
wouldn't have done much damage, I was doing the same thing across the
board in shorting CAD/JPY and EUR/CAD. A few here and a few there. They
add up to a bad day. As of this writing, it looks like these pairs are
finally moving in my direction. But instead of being patient with
reasonable stops, I thought I could do better and micro-managed my
positions to end up taking multiple small losses and with nothing left
on the table to ride the move. So what is the correct way of following
up on a dent in the account? I should have done the following instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce risk exposure by limiting trade size or overall opened
    positions until I am back up.</li>
<li>Focus on what I did wrong last week and stop doing that, i.e. no
    more day trading.</li>
<li>Recall my best trades and do more of that, i.e. my one and only
    finalized setup, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not so coincidentally, now that I'm in the deepest drawdown ever, this
is as good as ever to put this emergency recovery procedure into
practice.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After many trials and errors with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex market</a>
for a month, the first of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setups</a> is finally taking shape.
So I would like to document this approach here after a well executed
trade this week (illustrated below). This trading setup is based solely
on technical analysis. Here's an overview of the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a long term time frame for identifying setup.</li>
<li>Draw the major supports and resistances.</li>
<li>Add a momentum technical indicator.</li>
<li>Add a trend indicator.</li>
<li>An entry is signaled by an agreement of the trend and the indicator
    at the support or resistance price level. Do not enter yet.</li>
<li>Define a short term time frame for timing, use this for the
    following steps.</li>
<li>Draw the supports and resistances on this short time frame.</li>
<li>Place an order when the price breaks the short-term trend to be
    aligned with the trend on the longer one.</li>
<li>Exit when the entry conditions are gone (not necessarily reversed).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is very vague. So here's a real example in practice. Figure 1 shows
steps 1 to 5 on the daily chart of CAD/JPY for a short entry. The entry
point is the bar before the marked vertical line on Oct 21. See that
CAD/JPY tested the descending resistance line (step #2) with a negative
RSI divergence (#3). The trend as suggested by the moving averages is a
choppy downtrend (#4). Thus, the conditions were met and a short entry
is signaled. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"
caption="CAD/JPY"][<img alt="CAD/JPY" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy.png" />]<a href="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy.png">CAD/JPY</a>[/caption] For timing the
entry, Figure 2 is a 3-hour chart of CAD/JPY with the entries and exits
marked. Yellow triangles are entries and red dots are exits. I entered a
full position after CAD/JPY made the initial dive and then retraced to
the previous support (now resistance) line. It bounced right off that
line strongly (left side of figure). I entered at market price once we
made a hammer candlestick (negative signal) the bar before. Stop was
placed at 88.0, near the recent high and at a round number resistance.
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="CAD/JPY,
3-hour"][<img alt="CAD/JPY, 3-hour" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy_3h.png" />]<a href="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy_3h.png">CAD/JPY, 3-hour</a>[/caption] For the exit,
I had a manually adjusted hard stop to be a couple of resistances away.
I kept it loose on purpose because this position was my biggest winner.
(Let your profits run). But once the RSI on the daily passed below 50, I
took a more conservative approach on the exit stop. Then once CAD/JPY
tested 84.50 and hung around 85.0, I tightened my stop and was taken out
at 85.30. Note that my original target was 84.0, so I thought testing
84.50 was close enough. Also note that this setup is expected to be
executed recursively. It is meant to be run so that you're <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">stacking up
your winning position</a> if the conditions and the trend is in your
favour. This is actually where the power with this setup kicks in. I'll
continue with the CAD/JPY example to illustrate this point. Notice in
Figure 2 that I added to this CAD/JPY short at the (second from the
right) yellow triangle point on the chart at 86.3 for 50% more units.
The down move was still intact as shown in Figure 1 at the time. Using
the same setup, I added more units to this position. And by adding 50%
more to my position, I was able to ride that last wave down for +200
pips on these extra units. Otherwise, I would have exited at 85.30 on
the consolidation around 85.0 and left with nothing on the market for
the last big wave. The timing as shown in Figure 2 for this addition
isn't the same as for the original entry. But it's obvious enough on the
figure with the same markings which I used. Simply refer to Figure 2 for
a visual explanation on the timing for this entry. In case you haven't
noticed on Figure 2, but I just re-entered this position with half the
size using the same setup. Since this third entry is still in progress,
I can't comment on it just yet. We'll see how it goes. Finally, for ease
of referencing this trading setup later on, I will call this particular
setup, FTC (forex trend-continuation). Right now it's version 0.1, a
first publication release but still in beta testing with my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper
trading</a>. Once the setup has proven itself, I will use it in live
trading with real money. Then I will christen it with a version 1.0, and
perhaps a better name. In the mean time, I expect more refinement to
this setup as I continue to try it out on paper trading. Check my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC
tag</a> for more sample applications of this trading signal. Update Nov
18, 2009: I've changed the name from FTCS to FTC as I now have a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTR">FTR</a>
setup.</p>
