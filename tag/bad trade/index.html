            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market took a big bite out of me this week just as when I am not
giving it its fullest attention. I took a short-side trade in Manulife
Financial (MFC.TO) last Thursday simply <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-11jan-put-14-00-0-93-mark-13-97/">because of a price pattern</a>.
I did not seek to confirm my hypothesis with short-term price action and
intermarket analysis like I usually would because I've been so consumed
with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">setting up my trading system on the cloud</a>. I became careless
because of my recent win streak and my involvement in so many matters. I
lost my focus. My short in Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) is deep in red as
of this writing. The market gapped above my stop loss price over the
weekend and never eased back for me to exit at my stop as planned. I've
placed in a limit order to target a retracement to \$14.50 because
there's not much left to recuperate if I dump my position now. MFC.TO is
well above \$15, so I am prepared for the worst. Judging by the volume,
this looks like a valid breakout too. At least my put options don't
expire until January. If my puts expire, this will be a loss of \$372 +
\$9.90 commission = \$381.90 = 3.9% of my RRSP account. To put this into
perspective, according to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>, this may become my biggest
single loss in a trade in this account. Three folds greater than my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/boughtsold-250-tck-b-to-34-1033-68-loss-1-2/">previous biggest loser at 1.23%</a>. Ouch!</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Manulife

blunder this week. The real killer is in Ventana Gold (VEN.TO). As you
may recall, I have been very bullish on VEN.TO. In fact, I've been
stalking this gem for months by <a href="../tag/ven.to/">nibbling on small bullish positions</a>
to test the water now and then. Just as when I dug myself into a hole
because of this extended loss, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-didnt-miss-a-boat-i-missed-a-freakin-rocket/">VEN.TO launched off on a rocket</a> (Fig.
2). I am just staring at its takeoff outside the fence without the
ability to take a position because of my self-regulated risk exposure
limit. There goes a few weeks of research and analysis out the window.
Double ouch! [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

trading can be, at least I am adament with my risk management and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-reasons-why-i-even-bother-trading-a-small-account/">traded within my limits</a>. A 3.9% loss in a trade is horrible, but
it's not catastrophic. I will survive this one, redo my research, regain
my focus, and be able to fight on another day. This is what trading is
about.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update: Crude is making a dive. This might be the move that I waited but
got stopped out. I shorted crude oil on Friday afternoon below the 82
resistance. It was an undocumented trade. Now I am closing at a loss.
It's a slap on the hand for breaking my own trading rules. Oil broke
above 82 over the weekend. Fortunately, the opening gap was filled
before noon and I took the opportunity to cover my short. I was down 1%
at the open. Good thing I didn't panic and waited patiently (with a hard
stop just below the opening low) for a more rational exit. My planned
stop was \$9.15, the opening low was \$8.87, and I covered at \$9.12.
Just a tad under my plan but a lot higher than the low so far. Figure 1
is a chart of U.S. Oil Fund (USO) at the time of my exit. I traded the
Horizons BetaPro Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) as a vehicle for shorting
crude oil. The chart of USO is a better proxy of crude oil prices as
it's a few magnitudes higher volume (i.e. more popular) than HOD.TO.
From the looks of it, I will stay on the sideline until at least the
midterm election in the United States next week. Loss for this trade is
(\$9.12 - \$9.29) * 300 = -\$51 - \$9.90 commission = -\$60.90 = -0.6%.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>What I thought would be an intermediate term hold turns out to have
lasted mere minutes. I bought Teck Cominco (TCK.B.TO) after a small
bounce at \$34 support during lunch today. Figure 1 shows the clear
support level. Also note the fact that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-43-mark-16-27-loss-0-5/">my recent shorts haven't been
working</a>, so I thought I would go with the flow and go long. [caption

immediately after my long entry (something I haven't done in a while).
TCK cracked the \$34 support swiftly to \$33.80, my mental support. My
alert was sounded and I kept an eye on it afterward. But then not long
after \$33.80, my hard stop at \$33.70 was filled and TCK traded down to
\$33.66 or so. It has now stabilized around \$33.80 as of 2pm. Figure 2
shows the intraday chart of TCK.B.TO. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

for this trade is (\$33.68 - \$34.10) * 250 = -\$105 - \$4.95 * 2
commission = -\$114.90 = -1.2% of account. My account is now
experiencing a 3.4% drawdown since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">the high on June 8th</a>. I can't
help but feel that this was a stop hunt. TCK is creeping higher at the
moment. However, as my initial position was stopped out, I am not going
to re-enter this trade just yet. Let's see what it does near the close
today. I am labelling this particular trade as a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">bad trade</a> because
my stop was clearly too tight based on the time frame that I am
observing. I should have reduced my position size and widened my stop to
account for the recent volatility. Update: TCK gapped down 7% the day
after. At least my exit was timely.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Not much is happening in the market as it is trading in a tight range.
This is not good for my options as the time delta will slowly eating
away my premium. So I've decided to unload this position at a small loss
just now as the market is testing support across the board. The U.S.
dollar index is testing \$86 resistance. Oil is testing \$78 support.
S&amp;P500 is testing the 1070 support zone. Purchase price for these puts
were <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-48-mark-16-38/">\$1.48 per contract last Wednesday</a>. When Manulife Financial
(MFC.TO) was trading at 16.38. Loss is (\$1.48 - \$1.43) * 100 * 4 =
\$20 - \$13.95 * 2 commission = \$47.90 = 0.5% of account. As you can
see, the commission is horrible on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">RRSP trading account at
Questrade</a>. I will wind down trading options from now on and move back
to trading forex in the summer. My live account at <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> is
ready... Update: The market finally broke support the day after this
exit. This was not a good exit as I lost patience. MFC is testing \$16
support on June 29th opening hour and I don't expect it to hold. This
could turn out to be a winner if I had held.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Finally a profitable trade in my USDCAD short after being stopped out a
few times. My decision last week to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-short-target-hit-1-0581-trying-something-new-to-hold-for-longer/">hold this for longer</a> after
USDCAD touched my target paid off. I moved my stop closer last Thursday
evening and the order got filled on Friday. However, as I type this on
the following Monday, USDCAD is trading even lower at 1.0478. It looks
as though my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">original target of 1.0415</a> is in the cards. Even though
this is a profitable trade with a 0.17% gain in my demo account, there
is one major flaw with this short USDCAD play. I was not able to squeeze
more out of this profitable move. As I've said, this short took a few
tries. In fact, if we consider all the entires and exits of this play.
My stopped out losses totaled 0.29% and my single win here is merely
0.17%. So I'm actually at a net loss of 0.12% from all these work. My
win/loss rate is about 40% based on my review of recent forex trades. I
was able to edge out more than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">10% profit in four months</a> because
when I am wrong, I take small steps. But when I'm right, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">pile into a
position</a>. Ever since my trading environment has changed, I've been
trying to trade a longer timeframe. This USDCAD short is my first
attempt on a new strategy. Evidently, I will need to re-think and
re-learn what I've become accustomed to in the past few months. One of
the necessary trait of a successful trader is to be able to adapt.
Markets change. Traders need to evolve with the markets or they will
become obsolete. This will be a good test of myself to see if I can
re-invent myself to adapt to a changing trading environment. [caption

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[This post was updated on January 13, see addendum below.] I have
discussed my enthusiasm in shorting the Aussie a few times this week.
First trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">shorting AUD/JPY at 84.53</a>. After that got stopped
out, I re-tried at the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-retrying-audjpy-short-84-52-stop-85/">same level the next day</a>. My trade history in
this currency pair is shown in Figure 1 below. Evidently, I am early in
my trades as the recent upward momentum is still going. But that's just
speaking from hindsight advantage. What is actually wrong with this play
is that I was too eager at the first entry when the price was just at a
minor resistance (short-term trendline of Fig 1). In turn, that caused
me to lose my confidence and not be as aggressive as I should be when
the price reached a major resistance at 85.50. Referring to Fig. 1, I
made 5 attempts on the minor resistance below 84.60 in the first round.
What's worse is that I didn't have enough patience to wait after these
shorts failed and I tried again at 84.52. Even though that resistance
level is voided already. But here comes the kicker. I actually <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">noted
the important 85.50 level before my first attempt</a>. It was clearly on the chart and I even mentioned about its
significance. I just figured that it wouldn't be touched. How wrong I
was. As I said, another problem with being early in a trade is that it
stripe you of your confidence prematurely in a good setup. My setup to
short AUD/JPY is as good as ever now. I am drooling over that negative
RSI divergence shown in Fig. 1... But since I've already taken a beating
in this pair this week, my account drawdown dictates that I limit my
risk. As such, I can't back up the truck to pile in on this trade at
this point. But why not? I won't break one rule to compensate for
another. Although I am light in this trade now, I will not compromise my
risk management rules to compensate for my own mistakes. That would just
open a whole new can of worm. Besides, I can't say this often enough --
risk management is always the top priority in trading. In any case,
there will always be other opportunities. The moral of the story is
this. Do not be too eager to get into a trade. Secondly, adjust your
position size accordingly to the significance of the setup in play.</p>

an updated view of AUD/JPY a week later. The red dot on the 9th was my
last stopped out entry. As you can see, I missed the smooth 200 pips
ride down. This experience is proving to be better than I expected to
illustrate how being early in a trade can really hurt your account.</p>
