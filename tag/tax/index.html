            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If the idea of handing your RRSP contributions over to a sales person
(a.k.a. financial advisor) at a bank isn't appealing to you, then it is
time to consider your investment choices. I am about to contribute for
the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/considering-investment-options-for-my-first-rrsp/">first time ever into my RRSP</a> this year. So I performed my due
diligence by researching and evaluating my choices. This post is a
ranking of my findings. I evaluate each investment strategy according to
three criterias, in descending order of importance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk</strong>. Will I lose sleep at night if I put all my money in it?</li>
<li><strong>Reward</strong>. How much can I potentially gain?</li>
<li><strong>Effort</strong>. How much time and energy do I need to spend on it?</li>
</ul>
<p>My overall portfolio is exposed to enough risk already from my other
trading activities. So my risk appetite is leaning towards a
conservative approach. Also note that I factor in costs as a part of my
risk assessment. I place a 40% emphasis on this criteria. Next, I
consider the return of each investment vehicle using a 40% weight. For
obvious reasons. Lastly, I prefer something that requires as little time
and effort as possible. I weight this criteria at 20%. As I've said
numerous times, I don't like the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/">limitations in a registered
account</a>. It is like trying to invest with one hand tied behind my
back. I do not want to put much effort to manage this account because I
can do better in my regular trading. The resulting ranking of the six
types of markets <em>that I am considering</em> for my RRSP (and TFSA) is as
follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Guaranteed savings</li>
<li>Indices or sectors (through passive mutual funds or ETF's)</li>
<li>Fixed income (using a mutual fund or ETF bond index)</li>
<li>Gold</li>
<li>Stocks</li>
<li>Actively managed mutual funds</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing of note about investing in physical gold within a registered
account is that it can only be done at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> as far as I know.
Although I doubt they are the only one. Here is the table I used to
estimate this ranking. I give each category a score from 1 (bad) to 5
(good) based on my own experience and my sentiment of future market
condition. So yes, it is a very crude guess at best. Nevertheless, the
table shows that my best choice is to either put my RRSP money in a
savings account or invest in indices using passive mutual funds (like
the TD e-Series) or ETF's. However, I plan to do both. I will trade
indices in my RRSP and put my TFSA money in a high yield savings
account. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="493" caption="RRSP

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been fortunate enough to not have to think about taxes for the
longest time. Unfortunately though, that is because of my long stay in
academia plus a couple of years of a low salary research position. I
didn't have to pay much income taxes, if at all. Things are different
now that I am working in a full time job with a decent pay. I am
reminded of the impact of our high Canadian taxes from the missing chunk
on every paycheck. That is why I am looking into what to do with my RRSP
contribution lately. Last month, I analyzed the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">cost-benefit of a Tax
Free <em>Trading</em> Account</a>. I concluded that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-4/">a TFSA trading account is
not worth my while</a> for the moment. So I will probably just stash my
TFSA contribution in a good old savings account for now. That is not the
case with a RRSP. One big difference that change the whole argument
around with RRSP is that any contribution that I make into it is tax
deductible! I won't go into details here because I hate taxes. Refer to
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_Retirement_Savings_Plan">Wikipedia entry on RRSP</a> if you are unfamiliar with it.
Essentially, I am guaranteed about 30% (or your marginal tax rate) of
"profit" by way of tax refund for the amount of money which I put into
my RRSP account. I don't know about you, but 30% is a massive return for
me! And it's risk free! (Technically it's just a refund of my own money,
but still) The benefit of having a RRSP is obvious. What I have been
pondering about is where should I put my money in my RRSP? As I
discussed in <em><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-pay-trading-income-taxes-through-a-tfsa-trading-account/">Benefits of trading in a TFSA account</a></em>, there are many
limitations to a self-directed registered account. Although there are
certainly other options than just trading stocks in a registered
account. Here are the options that I have considered.</p>
<ol>
<li>Savings account</li>
<li>Fixed income</li>
<li>Mutual funds</li>
<li>Exchange traded funds</li>
<li>Individual stocks</li>
</ol>
<p>In my next post, I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/ranking-investment-options-for-my-self-directed-rrsp/">rank my preferences for each retirement investment option</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've always known that foreign exchange trading is treated as capital
gain tax in Canada. But just to be sure before filing my taxes soon,
I've decided to double check the facts from Canada Revenue Agency. As
you know, the difference between income tax and capital gain tax is
substantial. Income tax is taxed at your marginal tax rate. Whereas
capital gain tax is a generous half of your marginal tax rate. That
works out to a 10% to 20% difference. Taxes in Canada is generally
simple to do. The problem though, is sifting through the cacophony of
information within the Canada Revenue Agency to find out the applicable
rules. I've copy and pasted a couple of relevant excerpts from the 2010
CRA <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/menu/ITSC-e.html">Income Tax Interpretation Bulletin</a> for the record. Basically,
forex trading can be treated as either income or capital gain tax in
Canada (surprise). According to <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it95r/it95r-e.html">IT-95R Foreign exchange gains and
losses</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Where it can be determined that a gain or loss on foreign exchange
arose as a direct consequence of the purchase or sale of goods abroad,
or the rendering of services abroad, and such goods or services are
used in the <strong>business operations</strong> of the taxpayer, such gain or loss
is brought into income account. If, on the other hand, it can be
determined that a gain or loss on foreign exchange arose as a direct
consequence of the<strong>purchase or sale of capital assets</strong>, this gain or
loss is either a capital gain or capital loss, as the case may be.
Generally, the nature of a foreign exchange gain or loss is <strong>not
affected by the length of time</strong> between the date the property is
acquired (or disposed of) and the date upon which payment (or receipt)
is effected.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, it is very vague. That's why forex trading can be
considered income or capital gain tax. It is up to you and your
accountant to figure out which works for you. A noteworthy point in the
above excerpt is that the holding period is not taken into account.
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">So there's no 30-day rule
like in the states whereby frequent trading would miss out the capital
loss credit if they re-purchase the same asset within 30-day of
disposal.</span> Update: Looks like I have misconstrued the above
article with regard to capital loss. As Olga pointed out in the
comments, Chapter 5 of T4037 defines <em>Superficial Loss</em>. In which if you
<em>repurchase</em> your property (e.g. stock) within 30-days after a sale at a
loss, then that initial loss cannot be deducted as a capital loss. More
about the <a href="http://www.wheredoesallmymoneygo.com/superficial-loss-rules-in-canada/">Superficial Loss rules in Canada</a> can be found at
WhereDoesAllMyMoneyGo.com. Further down the page in IT-95R, we have the
following bullet.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A taxpayer who has transactions in foreign currency or foreign
currency futures that do not form part of business operations, or are
merely the result of sundry dispositions of foreign currency by an
individual, will be accorded by the Department the <strong>same treatment as
that of a "speculator" in commodity futures</strong> see 7 and 8 or IT-346R.
However, if such a taxpayer has special "Inside" information
concerning foreign exchange, he will be required to report his gains
and losses on income account.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it346r/it346r-e.html">IT-346R Commodity Futures and Certain Commodities</a> explains the tax
treatment of speculation in the commodity markets.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>As a general rule, it is acceptable for speculators to report all
their gains and losses from transactions in commodity futures or in
commodities as<strong>capital gains and losses</strong> with the result that only
one-half the gain is taxable, and one-half the loss is allowable
subject to certain restrictions, (hereinafter called "capital
treatment") provided such reporting is followed consistently from year
to year.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So there, we have it. Amateur forex traders, such as myself, can report
our forex trading gain/loss as capital gains and losses. The reason
being that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex">forex trading</a> isn't part of my business operation because
I have another primary source of income (e.g. salary from another job).</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Alright, so I'm <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-first-food-poisoning-experience/">back from the dead</a>. Let's finish this cost-benefit
analysis before the weekend. Here are back links for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-part-1/">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-2/">Part
2</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/is-a-5000-questrade-tfsa-trading-account-cost-effective-%e2%80%93-part-3/">Part 3</a> in case you missed them. The table below shows my
expected return as derived through part 2 and part 3 of this series. As
you can see, I'm only expected to break-even by risking 1% of my \$5000
TFSA trading account. Trading just for the sake of break-even isn't
exactly an enviable goal. Based on my statistics, I typically say an
expected return of 0.10% per trade is acceptable. Looking at the table,
that would require that I risk 1.5% per trade. [caption id=""
align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TFSA Trading Cost-Benefit for
Reward/Risk = 2.0 and 40% win rate"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/TFSA_trading_cost-benefit_analysis.png" />][][/caption] So I'll have to
risk 1.5% just to scrape in 0.10% of profit? The problem is obvious.
Using a \$5000 trading account with \$5 commission, along with my
historical trading performance simply do not justify the odds. I started
this series to study the cost effectiveness of a Questrade TFSA trading
account. But the conclusion which I derived is much broader. Considering
that even without being taxed, a \$5000 TFSA trading account is
insufficient for trading with a commission of \$5 or higher. Thus, if
this is a taxed, non-registered trading account, the cost would be even
more. As such, not only is \$5000 an insufficient capital for a
Questrade TFSA trading account; \$5000 is simply too little money to
trade any trading account with \$5 of commission per trade for me.
Remember though, this cost-benefit analysis is based on my own
statistics. You can input your own parameters into <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AnZW_RfDqK11dG5jVzUwbDIxWEQ5aFV3cjVRdU5BbFE&amp;hl=en">this spreadsheet</a>
to get <strong>your own set of results</strong>. To be fair, I must clarify that the
problem isn't with Questrade. Even with their <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">lowest trading commission
in Canada</a> (affiliate link), a \$5 trading commission for an account
of \$5000 is simply too much for me. Yes, there's nothing to stop you
from trading with a \$5 commission for a \$5000 account. Heck, many have
claimed to be successful with less than \$5000. However, that's just not
my style. I don't gamble with my hard earned money. I only trade when
the odds are in my favour. If the cost is un-proportionately high, it's
as if I've suffered a setback even before I begin fighting the battle.
As such, I'm going to say "no thanks!" to a Questrade TFSA trading
account for now. My short term plan is to look for a guaranteed TFSA
savings account until I can develop a trading system for Canadian stocks
that would justify the cost-benefit.</p> </div>
