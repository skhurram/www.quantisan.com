            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My semi-automated trading system, Quantised Trading Desk, closed its
first trade this week. I was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-eurgbp-as-hedge-and-bearish-nzdusd-as-diversification/">bullish EURGBP</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-usdjpy-on-week-of-april-17-2011/">USDJPY</a>, and
bearish NZDUSD as per the previous discussions. The QTD system saved me
from the premature calls in both USDJPY and NZDUSD by not making any
trade this week. That, in and of itself, has made me very happy with
QTD's first week of live trading. Particular in light of how fierce that
USDJPY down move has been. As a bonus, QTD entered a long position in
EURGBP for a small 0.19% gain as illustrated below. My parameter were a
maximum of 0.25% risk per position. The gain could have been better if
it weren't for that 61% retracement. Not that I'm complaining as I
haven't even looked at the market this past couple of days while the
system is trading for me. USDJPY touched my threshold support price
80.70, my bullish sentiment needs to be reevaluated. NZDUSD just cracked
a higher high (marginally though), so I'm easing on the bear button for
now. EURGBP is testing some resistance to, so I'm not so eager to dive
in again. Overall, I've been 2/3 wrong. I've told you before that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-didnt-miss-a-boat-i-missed-a-freakin-rocket/">I'm
very bad at timing the market</a>. That's why I developed QTD to trade
for me. Seeing that it's a long weekend, and I'll be way from town, I'm
just going to shut down my remote trade server in London until next week
when I can have some time to re-do my analysis. [caption

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm out of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-200-lll-to-47-04-stop-46-50/">my Lululemon position</a> minutes prior to the close. Holding
time was just a day. I would have liked to hold this position for longer
but the market is directionless. In addition, the stop hunt on the
shorts in LLL.TO is unmistakable as seen in Figure 1. Option expiration
is this Friday. So I'm taking my profit now prior to expected
volatility. A reward/risk of 2 to 1 is too tempting to let go. However,
LLL.TO is pushing higher into the close. So perhaps this is yet another
lack of patience on my part. Update Nov 18: Yes, I was too early indeed.
LLL.TO gapped upward the day after my exit. Option pain is pegged at
\$45 on the American shares (NASDAQ:LULU). LULU is trading just above
\$47 as I close my position. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

EUR/USD is bouncing off a long term support around 1.3600. Thus I'm
covering my short in Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) before the weekend.
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/story-of-a-bad-trade-and-a-missed-opportunity/">This position turned out horribly</a>. I've been waiting for MFC.TO to
print 14.50, just above its 38.6% Fibonacci retracement level at 14.40
on the recent spike. But 14.80 doesn't seem to budge even today with all
that bearishness floating around. Intraday volume is also decreasing on
every new test of this intraday support. So I'm throwing in the towel
here. Loss is (\$0.45 - \$0.93) * 4 * 100 = -\$192 - \$27.90 =
-\$219.90 = -2.3% of account.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update: Crude is making a dive. This might be the move that I waited but
got stopped out. I shorted crude oil on Friday afternoon below the 82
resistance. It was an undocumented trade. Now I am closing at a loss.
It's a slap on the hand for breaking my own trading rules. Oil broke
above 82 over the weekend. Fortunately, the opening gap was filled
before noon and I took the opportunity to cover my short. I was down 1%
at the open. Good thing I didn't panic and waited patiently (with a hard
stop just below the opening low) for a more rational exit. My planned
stop was \$9.15, the opening low was \$8.87, and I covered at \$9.12.
Just a tad under my plan but a lot higher than the low so far. Figure 1
is a chart of U.S. Oil Fund (USO) at the time of my exit. I traded the
Horizons BetaPro Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) as a vehicle for shorting
crude oil. The chart of USO is a better proxy of crude oil prices as
it's a few magnitudes higher volume (i.e. more popular) than HOD.TO.
From the looks of it, I will stay on the sideline until at least the
midterm election in the United States next week. Loss for this trade is
(\$9.12 - \$9.29) * 300 = -\$51 - \$9.90 commission = -\$60.90 = -0.6%.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I got whipsawed out of my crude oil short as the market consolidates.
Seeing that the G20 is meeting in Seoul today and tomorrow, not much is
happening on this flat Friday. EUR/USD is in a 100 pips range. S&amp;P 500
is in a 5 points range. Maybe something will happen near the close, but
I won't be around for it as I have no position in the market anymore.
Crude oil is still looking bearish though as it is crawling on its short
term support line (Fig. 1). Perhaps my stop was just too tight as I
moved it up a couple of times to lock in some profits. Profit is
(<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-300-hod-to-9-19-stop-9-05/">\$9.40</a> - \$9.19) * 300 = \$63 - \$9.90 commission = \$53.10 = 0.5%

            <div class="article-content"> <p>China not-so-surprised the market (their delayed Treasury report was a
hint) with a 0.25% rate hike overnight (WSJ: <a href="http://on.wsj.com/afczTG">China Raises Interest
Rates</a>). The US Dollar shot up, precious metals took a big hit. I
close my gold short soon after the TSX market open to collect some quick
profit. Rinse and repeat. I did mention that this trade is a short term
swing. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-am-sorry-my-precious-bought-350-hgd-to-10-26/">bought this Horizons BetaPro Gold Bear Plus (HGD.TO)</a>, a
leveraged gold short, on Friday and unloaded it this Tuesday. I fought
against my greed to hold just a little longer. But the ascending support
line on gold is too obvious to ignore (Fig. 1). Thus I closed this short
term position with this 5%+ gap up while the market is still deciding
what to do. Furthermore, I noticed the equities market are holding
rather well at the open. S&amp;P500 held onto 1170 price level. Asian
markets were marginally green overnight. And even the CAC in Europe is
fighting an intraday low as the North American markets open. Thus, the
sky is not falling just yet. I figured it would take more omph to push
this market further down as we are indeed in a strong bullish move. At
the very least I am expecting some retaliation from the bulls. This
can't be this easy for the bears, can it?</p>
