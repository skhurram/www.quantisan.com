            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market seem ready to crack but it is not. So I am taking profit on
my CIBC short here on a weaker volumn retest of the \$70.50 support
(Figure 1). I bought <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cm-to-10oct-puts-5-00-mark-74-02/">3 puts contracts four weeks ago at \$5.00</a> when
CM was trading at \$74.02. Then I [added 3 more contracts with the same
strike price and expiry for \$5.65][] when CM was trading at \$72.30.
The average cost was \$5.35. Thus, profit is \$750 - (\$12.95 + \$3.00)
x 2 = \$718.10 = 8.0% of total account.</p>

<p>This is the last of my positions. I have no more outstanding position in
any market. CM.TO looks to be on the brink of a collapse. I may be
making a mistake here by offloading my shorts before the fireworks.
However, as I was saying, the market is still hanging on. Furthermore,
there's a positive divergence for CM.TO as shown on Figure 2 according
to the oscillator at the top of the chart. So I am taking profit now to
reduce my risk as this position is relatively big for my small RRSP
trading account.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my crude oil short with Horizons BetaPro Bear Plus (HOD.TO) at
\$11.94. Purchase <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-11-11/">price was \$11.11 from yesterday</a>. I don't think
this is the end of the oil bear run yet. However, I couldn't give up a
10% gain (totalling 2.2% in account) in one day. Besides, it is Friday
so I would rather take some profits off the table before the weekend.
Profit is \$207.50 - \$4.95 x 2 = \$197.60. The maximum potential risk
was \$152.50 based on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-11-11/">my stop calculation</a>. Thus, the realized reward/risk ratio is 197.60/152.50 =
1.30. It's alright but not that good as I usually aim for 1.50 at least.
Here are the main reasons for my exit. Figure 1 shows the chart of crude
oil. Note that it is end-of-day data only so today's massive drop is not
shown. I marked my exit price of \$71.00 (crude oil) 0n the chart. See
that this price is a support level in the long term.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the intraday chart of U.S. DB Oil Fund (DBO). Notice the
weak volume on the second test of 23.70 support level. This figure was
captured at the time of my exit. DBO traded below 23.70 and HOD.TO
traded above 12.00 as I am writing this. Let's see if they can stay that
way.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update: I closed this at \$6.36 just now as my HOD.TO position is
trekking back close to breakeven. This is a loss of \$37.50 + \$9.90
commission. I re-entered my natural gas short with HND.TO @ 6.51 as
planned on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-380-hnd-to-7-35/">my previous break-even trade</a>. The U.S. Natural Gas Fund
(UNG) is testing the top of its channel at \$7.85 as shown on Figure 1.</p>

support as I'm writing this and is now trading down to \$6.38. My mental
stop is at \$6.20 and hard stop is \$6.00. Figure 2 shows the intraday
chart of HND.TO as the time of my entry. My risk for this trade is
(\$6.51 - \$6.00) * 250 shares = \$127.50 = 1.4% of my RRSP trading
account. This should be the last of my new position for a while. I have
enough on the table with my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cm-10oct-puts-74-00-5-65-mark-72-30/">CM.TO</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-11-11/">HOD.TO</a>, and this. My goal now
is to move my stops to breakeven as soon as possible.</p>

\$8.60 last week while I was away. So I am not taking any chance for
this position to go negative. The net gain in this is \$25 after \$10

it seems that natural gas is in consolidation mode. I will be watching
the channel as drawn on Figure 2 for another chance to short it via
HND.TO later. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update May 10: Looks like I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-illustration-of-what-it-means-by-missing-the-boat-in-trading/">missed the boat</a>. TCK.B gapped up almost
7% at the Monday open to \$38.88. I won't be chasing the market at this
point as the reward/risk ratio isn't appealing anymore. Update: I got
stopped out at breakeven (after commission) before I can post this piece
at the end of the day. I'm back to all cash going into the weekend. I am
taking a dip in Teck Resources (TCK/B.TO) with 110 shares bought at
\$36.03. This is a trade to "buy when everyone else is in fear".
Following my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-hell-and-back-a-review-of-tsx-after-a-v-day/">assessment of the market yesterday</a>, I don't think
things are that bad, yet. So I am establishing a small position in a
strong company today. TCK is trading on its 200 day moving average at
\$35 this week (Figure 1). Yesterday's epic dive and recovery didn't
break this \$35 support. So that's a very good sign for TCK.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Tech Resources
(TCK-B.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO.png" />][][/caption] Furthermore, \$35 is an obvious
psychological round number support. It is also above the recent low of
\$32.50 printed in February of this year as shown in Figure 1. The
oscillator value (top of Figure 1) is making a positive divergence as
TCK is testing this support level). I entered today based on the 5-day
intraday chart. This morning's opening hour test of \$35 support has
lower volume than earlier this week (Figure 2). As such, I think \$35
can hold. So I entered when the price shot above minor resistance at
\$36.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TCK-B.TO
intraday snapshot at time of entry"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO-intraday.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO-intraday.png">1</a>[/caption] The price
drifted back under \$35.50 after I entered but then reversed and tested
\$37. I moved my stop loss to breakeven as it touched an equidistance
price opposite of my stop. Just so I don't see profits turn into losses.
If I get stopped out today, I will not re-enter until after the weekend.
My target is \$40 and original stop was \$35 for about a 4 to 1 reward
to risk ratio. I am risking 1.25% in this trade with a position size of
110 shares.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) position this morning as crude
oil broke below \$80 briefly and the Dollar Index rose above \$84.
My<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">original target was \$27</a> for this short. But considering the fact
that I mistakenly doubled my position size, I am closing this trade a
step above at this \$27.50 support level (see Figure 1 for CVE.TO
support lines). Furthermore, the time decay on the options premium is
accelerating so I needed to sell this soon. The final profit on this
position is \$858.15 (after \$63.80 commission), or just over 10% in my
RRSP account. Although this trade is profitable, it is a horrible trade
for the following reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>I accidentally <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-just-made-a-grave-fundamental-mistake-in-my-cve-to-trade/">bought more contracts when I intended to sell</a>.</li>
<li>Not correcting my mistake immediately.</li>
<li>I risked too much at 3% (of account) initially and then 10% after my
    mistake.</li>
<li>Peak drawdown was over \$1000 (12.5%) at one time.</li>
<li>Too eager to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-10jul17-puts-30-00-mx-2-45-mark-28-64/">add to my position once it moved</a>.</li>
<li>Reward-to-Risk ratio is less than 1.0, so I threw big money for
    smaller gain.</li>
<li>Commission ends up eating 7% of profit away. That is too much.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, I made one, two, ... seven too many mistakes in this
trade. Luckily, I did manage to do some things right.</p>
<ol>
<li>Patience. There were a few days when the price moved sideway. I
    didn't succumb to my emotions and dump the shares when it was nerve
    whacking to hold onto a loss. The price was still below my mental
    stop so I held.</li>
<li>After the initial shock of doubling my position as the price moved
    away, I mentally accepted my loss and was able to study the market
    objectively since.</li>
<li>Didn't take profit too early once the price moved back in my favour
    this week.</li>
</ol>
<p>I won't be as lucky every time. Learn from my mistakes and exploit on my
strengths. That is the lesson from this trade.</p>
