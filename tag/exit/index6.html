            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update: I closed this at \$6.36 just now as my HOD.TO position is
trekking back close to breakeven. This is a loss of \$37.50 + \$9.90
commission. I re-entered my natural gas short with HND.TO @ 6.51 as
planned on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-380-hnd-to-7-35/">my previous break-even trade</a>. The U.S. Natural Gas Fund
(UNG) is testing the top of its channel at \$7.85 as shown on Figure 1.</p>

Fund (UNG)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-06-03-UNG.png" />][][/caption] However, HND.TO cracked the \$6.50
support as I'm writing this and is now trading down to \$6.38. My mental
stop is at \$6.20 and hard stop is \$6.00. Figure 2 shows the intraday
chart of HND.TO as the time of my entry. My risk for this trade is
(\$6.51 - \$6.00) * 250 shares = \$127.50 = 1.4% of my RRSP trading
account. This should be the last of my new position for a while. I have
enough on the table with my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cm-10oct-puts-74-00-5-65-mark-72-30/">CM.TO</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-11-11/">HOD.TO</a>, and this. My goal now
is to move my stops to breakeven as soon as possible.</p>

NYMEX Natural Gas Bear Plus (HND.TO) tested \$7.40 support on notable
volume. Figure 1 shows the intraday chart of HND.TO at the time of my

\$8.60 last week while I was away. So I am not taking any chance for
this position to go negative. The net gain in this is \$25 after \$10
commission, which is essentially breakeven from my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-380-hnd-to-7-25-stop-7-00/">\$7.25 purchase
price a couple of weeks ago</a>. Looking at the daily chart of Figure 2,
it seems that natural gas is in consolidation mode. I will be watching
the channel as drawn on Figure 2 for another chance to short it via
HND.TO later. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update May 10: Looks like I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-illustration-of-what-it-means-by-missing-the-boat-in-trading/">missed the boat</a>. TCK.B gapped up almost
7% at the Monday open to \$38.88. I won't be chasing the market at this
point as the reward/risk ratio isn't appealing anymore. Update: I got
stopped out at breakeven (after commission) before I can post this piece
at the end of the day. I'm back to all cash going into the weekend. I am
taking a dip in Teck Resources (TCK/B.TO) with 110 shares bought at
\$36.03. This is a trade to "buy when everyone else is in fear".
Following my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-hell-and-back-a-review-of-tsx-after-a-v-day/">assessment of the market yesterday</a>, I don't think
things are that bad, yet. So I am establishing a small position in a
strong company today. TCK is trading on its 200 day moving average at
\$35 this week (Figure 1). Yesterday's epic dive and recovery didn't
break this \$35 support. So that's a very good sign for TCK.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Tech Resources
(TCK-B.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO.png" />][][/caption] Furthermore, \$35 is an obvious
psychological round number support. It is also above the recent low of
\$32.50 printed in February of this year as shown in Figure 1. The
oscillator value (top of Figure 1) is making a positive divergence as
TCK is testing this support level). I entered today based on the 5-day
intraday chart. This morning's opening hour test of \$35 support has
lower volume than earlier this week (Figure 2). As such, I think \$35
can hold. So I entered when the price shot above minor resistance at
\$36.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TCK-B.TO
intraday snapshot at time of entry"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO-intraday.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO-intraday.png">1</a>[/caption] The price
drifted back under \$35.50 after I entered but then reversed and tested
\$37. I moved my stop loss to breakeven as it touched an equidistance
price opposite of my stop. Just so I don't see profits turn into losses.
If I get stopped out today, I will not re-enter until after the weekend.
My target is \$40 and original stop was \$35 for about a 4 to 1 reward
to risk ratio. I am risking 1.25% in this trade with a position size of
110 shares.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) position this morning as crude
oil broke below \$80 briefly and the Dollar Index rose above \$84.
My<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">original target was \$27</a> for this short. But considering the fact
that I mistakenly doubled my position size, I am closing this trade a
step above at this \$27.50 support level (see Figure 1 for CVE.TO
support lines). Furthermore, the time decay on the options premium is
accelerating so I needed to sell this soon. The final profit on this
position is \$858.15 (after \$63.80 commission), or just over 10% in my
RRSP account. Although this trade is profitable, it is a horrible trade
for the following reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>I accidentally <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-just-made-a-grave-fundamental-mistake-in-my-cve-to-trade/">bought more contracts when I intended to sell</a>.</li>
<li>Not correcting my mistake immediately.</li>
<li>I risked too much at 3% (of account) initially and then 10% after my
    mistake.</li>
<li>Peak drawdown was over \$1000 (12.5%) at one time.</li>
<li>Too eager to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-10jul17-puts-30-00-mx-2-45-mark-28-64/">add to my position once it moved</a>.</li>
<li>Reward-to-Risk ratio is less than 1.0, so I threw big money for
    smaller gain.</li>
<li>Commission ends up eating 7% of profit away. That is too much.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, I made one, two, ... seven too many mistakes in this
trade. Luckily, I did manage to do some things right.</p>
<ol>
<li>Patience. There were a few days when the price moved sideway. I
    didn't succumb to my emotions and dump the shares when it was nerve
    whacking to hold onto a loss. The price was still below my mental
    stop so I held.</li>
<li>After the initial shock of doubling my position as the price moved
    away, I mentally accepted my loss and was able to study the market
    objectively since.</li>
<li>Didn't take profit too early once the price moved back in my favour
    this week.</li>
</ol>
<p>I won't be as lucky every time. Learn from my mistakes and exploit on my
strengths. That is the lesson from this trade.</p>
