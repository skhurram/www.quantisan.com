was definitely a great entry. Now let's see if this exit is good too or
not. I'll consider re-entering near the close if it goes above \$28.
\$28 is definitely a resistance for TNA in the short term. However, I am
leaning towards entering some real stocks instead if the market proves
ready for a good rally.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Blood on the market again. I've dumped my SLW since it broke my stop of
\$5.30 cleanly at the open. I wouldn't touch it again until SLW can
clear above \$5.40 or below \$4.70.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-120-slw-573/">bought this position for \$5.73</a> a few days ago. That's a net loss,
with commission, of \$49.60. Add to the fact that SLW once rose to
\$6.40 between now and when I bought. I have once again let profits turn
to losses.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the low volume top on Jan 9th followed by a gap downthe
next day should be strong warning sign. Then a hard stop should be
placed at the support of Jan 10th at about \$5.65.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been stopped out of my -2.0 trailing stop placed just minutes ago
this morning. \$135 seems like a strong resistance for SKF. We barely
broke it this morning on decent volume. Furthermore, \$138 is a 50 day
MA and \$140 is a good round number resistance. In other words, there
are a few resistances to be broken going up from here.</p>
<p>Having <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-34-dug-2344-and-bought-10-skf-104125/">entered SKF at \$104 in the new year</a>, I am content with the
gain for this trade. It has exceeded my original short term target of
120.</p>
<p>However, I would watch SKF and see if it breaks below 130. If it can
stay above 130 today, then that's a very good sign.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After holding SLW for a few weeks, I'm finally out for now. I have
traded in and out of SLW for the past few months. So there isn't an
exact price and date of entry for these 246 shares. The effective
purchase price was about \$3.50.</p>
<p>As I noted more than a few times in the past, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">I love SLW</a>. I intended
to hold it as my core position for the long term. However, as I have
learned the hard way, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/auto-bailout-shakeout-december-13-2008/">buy-and-hold isn't an effective strategy</a> in
the current market condition. So I've decided to sell my SLW on some
significant weakness.</p>
<p>From Figure 1, SLW has tested the long term resistance (from 2007) of
\$7 twice recently. We still haven't broken it despite <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2008-post-holiday-market-analysis/">S&amp;P 500 breaking
its own resistance</a>. Moreover, we can see from Figure 2 that this
second top is a lot weaker across the indicators. So this is effectively
a double top formation, for now.</p>
<p>I still have my reserve on this because it is a holiday week, so low
volume is expected. Thus, I would watch for SLW's action next week and
see if it can break \$7 and then get back in at a higher price. I'd
rather miss out on a \$1 or even \$2 than watch it make a double top. I
have nearly doubled on this trade so I'm just trying not to be greedy.</p>
<p>However, there is a possibility that we might gap up from here and
rocket higher next week. If that's the case, I will probably not chase
it and look for another trade (TCK looks good).</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>DUG broke my \$25 stop yesterday. I gave it some room because of the
recent \$6 / share distribution on Dec 22. So that effectively shifted
the chart by 6 points. However, the Crude Oil broke above it's 20-day MA
and is showing signs of strength, Figure 2. So I decided to get out of
DUG as my short hedge and move into SKF.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-34-dug-3000/">DUG shares were bought for \$30</a>. Distribution was \$6.06. So my
net lost per share on this trade is [(\$23.44 + \$6.06) - \$30] =
-\$0.5. Which is a total loss of \$0.5 * 34 = \$17 + \$10 commission.
It's basically a breakeven trade.</p>

<p>As I was saying, I replaced DUG with SKF as my short hedge. We are
testing the Oct support on SKF. Furthermore, despite the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2008-post-holiday-market-analysis/">S&amp;P breaking
above the down channel this week</a> and along with SKF's distribution,
SKF is still above the psychological 100 level.</p>

<p>Stop: \$96, the October support.</p>
<p>Target: \$120, a congestion zone.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is merely a short hedge play so I actualy don't hope
for big gains on this.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>To bail. Not to bail. To bail. Not to bail. Friday's market gapped down
big time on news the bailout failed to pass the senate on Thursday
night. Then just hours later, rumours were surfacing about the White
House stepping in with the TARP money. As of Saturday, FP headline reads
White House holds off on auto bailout.</p>
<p>Since I'm no economist, I am not going to discuss about the auto bailout
here. What matters to me is the market. As I was saying, the market
gapped down Friday morning and even touched 851 in the first few
minutes. However, it hacked its way back up to close positive at 879.73.</p>
<p>We managed to hold this critical 850 support level as I noted in
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/post-market-analysis-december-11-2008/">Thursday's post-market analysis</a>. However, I wouldn't want to add to
the longs at this point because both of my uptrend channels have been
broken. I feel that at this point, it is safer to watch and be more late
into a trend than usual.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to see the S&amp;P 500's behaviour around 860 or
900 (Figure 2), which ever comes first, before adding to my existing
positions.</p>

<p>On a more personal note, my stops for DRYS and SKF were triggered on
Friday.</p>
<p>On December 12, 2008 8:30:32 AM, my -\$1.0 trailing stop for DRYS were
triggered (stop at \$7.90) and my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-200-drys-533/">last 100 shares</a> were sold for a
basement price of \$7.34. I have definitely been a victim by the market
makers gunning for stops. As DRYS pushed higher throughout the day and
closed at \$9.37 on Friday.</p>
<p>As I'm actually away on a trip for these few weeks, I don't think I'll
re-enter DRYS until it clears the resistance at \$12. I simply cannot
watch it as close as I would like.</p>
<p>In any case, I already unloaded half my position <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-drys-111103/">previously at
\$11.11</a>. So although I feel I've been ripped off with my stop, I
believe this is overall still a good trade because I unloaded on
strength and have set a reasonable (using my channel) stop just in case
it turns back down on me while I'm away.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_973" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>My Ultrashort Financials (SKF) stop was triggered on Friday too. This
one I am a little dumbfounded. I have set my trailing stop at -\$17 on
the mark for SKF. The stop price of \$124 was triggered and my 7 shares
were sold for \$124.09. Having <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-7-skf-12883/">bought at \$128.83 the previous day</a>,
this is a small loss.</p>
<p>Notice that giant opening spike in the chart below? This is yet another
example of the market makers gunning for the stops. I believe I should
have set a hard stop instead for this one since I'm using it as a hedge.</p>

<p>This is still a trader's market. Since I'm away oversea, I can't manage
my account as effective as I would have liked. Setting the trailing
stops was a safety measure. Although they worked against me this time, I
still think it was a good decision given my circumstances.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am at 50% longs now with no hedge (not good). My other 50% is
in cash. My primary short term goal now is to seek out a good short
entry to hedge my longs. I don't think I have the guts to add anymore
longs until I see more strength in this rally.</p> </div>
