            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I shorted AUD/JPY on the 20th and then shorted EUR/JPY on the 21st. Both
positions were stopped out before Tokyo opened tonight. I didn't write
an opening post for EUR/JPY because it's the same as usual, long term
setup, short term timing. I'll briefly go over the two trades here and
what I have learned in hindsight. First let's talk about the AUD/JPY
trade. I wrote about the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-50-83-60-stop-85-50/">entry here</a>. Figure 1 shows the daily chart.
AUD/JPY has managed to edge out of its channel with an obvious negative
divergence on the RSI. However, it feels as though it's going to turn
any time soon as seen in Fig. 2. I'm not going to try again though
because I need to learn to trade what I see and what I feel. I shouldn't
even consider to short it until its below the short term channel. For
this AUD/JPY short entry, I entered too early because I drew my channel
too tight. If you compare Fig. 2 in this post with Fig. 2 from the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-50-83-60-stop-85-50/">entry post</a>, you'll see that the supporting line is lower
here. The previous line didn't enclose everything as it should. For my
EUR/JPY trade, I tried to short the top again.... <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">When will I learn</a>?
Fig. 3 shows the setup on the daily. EUR/JPY is obviously testing a
strong resistance. So far so good. Fig. 4 shows the 3-hour chart for my
entry (yellow inverted triangle to the right, the last red dot is the
exit). This is where I failed. EUR/JPY was testing 137 and the top of
the channel before I entered. Then once I saw that EUR/JPY failed to
touch 137 again for a few bars, I entered. Shorting a new top is
ill-advised because the price can consolidate upward along with the
channel as shown in Fig. 4. You'll be fighting a losing battle as the
momentum is working against you. In any case, the lesson from both of
these trades is that I need to learn to be more patient with my entry.
The loss for AUD/JPY is -130 pips for -\$29.82 and the loss for EUR/JPY
is -77 pips for -\$26.46. At least my position size was halved because I
knew these are risky trades. Note: All the charts were taken just now
after the exit. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well, that descending trendline didn't last long for GBP/USD. I shorted
it when it was testing it and saw that the RSI was at a prior high too
(Fig. 1). I placed my order just below the short-term ascending support
to hope for a break to the downside, see Fig. 2. GBP/USD consolidated
around that short-term support for a few hours and has now broken upward
to a strong resistance at 1.6600. It's the top of a previous congestion
zone, highlighted rectangle in Fig. 1. GBP/USD at 1.666 is a very
tempting short, but never short a new high, as my rules say. So I'm
gonna wait for a few more hours with this and see how it goes. Position
size: 50% Entry: 1.634 Stop: 1.645, stopped out. Target: 1.6100 Reward /
Risk = 240 / 110 = 2.2 \&lt; 3, so only 50% position. I think I'll stick
with the 3 factor as a limit. Even these 2+ trades aren't working so
well for me because my probability of success has been low.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my successful EUR/JPY long just before the weekend with a tight
stop. Notice from Figure 1 that EUR/JPY is now in overbought territory.
In addition, a negative divergence is developing on the RSI from the
recent 2 peaks also at 135.00. The best thing about this trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-eurjpy-long-100-129-99-stop-128-80/">my
entry</a>. However, I certainly didn't chop this setup the best I could.
Even though I rode this up for +500 pips, I only had a 50% position
size. There were two easily identifiable adding points which I could
have taken advantage of. When EUR/JPY broke above 132.00, which was a
clear short-term resistance, a day after my entry I should have added to
my position then because of short-term momentum. Another chance came at
132.50 or so. As shown in Figure 2, when the price retested the low end
of the channel at 132.50. Both of these opportunities would have
survived with my usual stop of 100 pips. Another disappointment was that
my second half of the position was stopped out shortly because I moved
my stop up too soon. I was confident enough when I placed the order to
enter a full position size. But my over-zealous need to reduce risk got
the better of me. I observed on a daily time frame but traded in the
3-hour. To be more accurate in pointing the finger, it was my lack of
patience that stopped out my other half of the position. Anyway, I did
rode the wave with a sufficient position size. One thing I just noticed
is the T formation in Figure 2. EUR/JPY is back to where it started a
month ago. Where it heads now is uncertain. I will keep an eye on this
pair and aim to re-enter another long in a few days. The trend is your
friend.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>EUR/USD looked as though it was going to break through 1.50 when it
broke 1.49 (Fig. 1). I waited til it marked a short term top at 1.4920
(Fig. 2) and then placed a stop entry just above it at 1.4921. EUR/USD
traded above it for a few hours but failed to break 1.4970. It has now
retraced to a short term support. If it continues to decline, the double
divergent top will be all written over the wall (Fig. 1) and it'll be a
good short for the next few weeks. Until it moves out of this trading
range though, this is still an uncertain trade. On another note, I have
now had a string of 7 consecutive losses. Good thing these are merely
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trades</a> for experimentation. Looking over the history and
statistics, it's apparent that many of these trades were taken to <strong>try
for the top/bottom</strong> just after signs of reversal in the short term
(except for this EUR/USD trade, which is with the trend). Thus, from now
on, if I'm to go against the intermediate trend (daily), limit my
position size by reducing a 50% position size entry to a 33% entry, at
most. Furthermore, only enter when the instrument has marked a short
term lower top and has broken the immediate support. After paper trading
for a month, my forex trending strategy is finally starting to take
shape...</p>
