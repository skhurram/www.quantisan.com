            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've finally managed to offload my COF puts. This position was entered
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-cof-100-sep-09-35-put-1-90-mark-35-89/">two weeks ago at 1.90</a>, mark 35.89. The <strong>total loss is \$60 +
\$15</strong>. This is yet another poor trade because I didn't exit when my
stop was hit. This has been happening way too often lately while I'm
trying to catch the top (another big mistake). While it might be
obvious, but it's now clear to me that playing with a limited capital is
detrimental to my trading psychology. The commission is too much in
comparison to my position size. So I was often inclined to hold when I
should have been nimble.</p>
<p>The market finally moved downward with a sizable move today. S&amp;P500
tanked 20 points in an hour this morning. However, on a second test of
the 1000 level, I noticed a divergence on the TICK and COF wasn't making
a low like the market. That's when I decided to unload this position as
we're at the bottom of the recent channel. In addition, the long term
support at \$35.45 (Figure 2, pink line) should be a tough nut to crack
in the short term.</p>
<p>My only position left is my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-15-bc-100-sep-09-7-5-put-39-mark-9-12/">puts in BC</a>. I am now going to tie my
hands away from my trading platform and step back to developing my
trade. On the other hand, my quantitative finance work has been
progressing nicely and I should be able to publish some useful updates
soon.</p>
<p>Update: COF closed at \$35.09 today. I was early again. It's pretty
clear by now that my strategy is flawed. The more reason why I need to
put my head down and really start thinking.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've finally liquidated my COF shorts. The bid/ask was 0.25/0.35 and I
placed a limit order at 0.30. It was executed immediately. This leads me
to believe we'll be heading much lower today because of the market's
eagerness to take my puts.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for dumping these puts. First, is that the August
expiry is this Friday. The time decay this week has been brutal. <strong>A new
rule for options trading is that close any long options before the last
8 days or so til expiry.</strong> From then, the time decay really accelerates.</p>
<p>Secondly, we gapped lower today at the market, but there is no follow
through to the weakness at all. In fact, the market is making a
logarithmic rise and holding above 985 on the S&amp;P by 10:30am. The TICK
has also crossed +800 multiple times; whereas the lowest we've got so
far in the TICK is -728.</p>
<p>With the support for COF at \$34.00, there is very little I have to gain
when the market overall is holding above 985 and seem to be going higher
as of now. So I've decided to dump this position.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-cof-100-aug-09-33-put-2-20-mark-32-10/">purchased these puts at 2.20 about two weeks ago</a>. Total loss.
\$380 + \$15 = \$395. This is yet another trade that got away from me. I
am now going to limit my trading until I can find my edge again.</p>
<p>One mistake I've been making is neglecting the market environment. For
one, we've been in a bull market until proven otherwise (probably not
anymore since last Friday). Second, the market has been very choppy and
trading in a range this month. These are factors that I need to consider
in my future trades.</p>

longs this week</a> before expiration. My opportunity came today when PG
broke \$52.50 twice but failed to hold it for long. The time decay is
eating the premium fast this week, so seeing that it's unlikely PG will
make a spike higher now, so I'm unloading my August calls for it.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-pg-100-aug-09-52-5-call-60-mark-52-16/">bought these calls for \$0.60 last week</a> to hedge my shorts. This

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market is finally starting to ease this week. But RTH is holding its
fort pretty well so far. So I placed a stop in the morning at the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-rth-100-aug-09-85-put-3-30-mark-82-91/">original stop of \$83.91</a>. I got stopped out right at 3pm when we
have our usual last hour lift. However, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-cof-100-aug-09-33-put-2-20-mark-32-10/">my COF puts</a> remain in case
the weakness continues.</p>
<p>In hindsight, this trade was bad. The entry was good. But I screwed up
on the exit. When RTH gapped higher (passing my stop) the day after I
entered, I should have looked for an exit. The opportune time to ditch
was on August 5th when RTH backed down to test \$82 briefly but held its
ground to a higher close.</p>
<p>Once my stop is hit, my priority should be to look for an exit to
minimize my loss.</p>
<p>Total loss for this trade is (\$3.30 - \$2.00) x 100 x 2 + \$15 = \$275!</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm back in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-2-vno-100-aug-09-55-put-1-90-mark-56-1399/">Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) once again</a>. This time, I'm
giving it a longer time frame by buying the September puts instead of
the August. The 60 puts premium between the August and September is only
more by 25% or so. And the theta on the September puts are lower.</p>
<p>The market is very choppy lately around this 1000 pivot for the S&amp;P500.
Thus, I've found myself spending way too much time watching the market
when I'm supposed to be doing other things. So I'm putting my chips in
now, at a point which I think have passed the near term top based on
yesterday's close and today's open, to keep myself off the screen.</p>
<p>I was comparing between VNO or COF for this position. Both looked like
good candidates for a short but VNO has a higher weekly RSI at the
moment, so I decided to go for it.</p>
<p>Entry: \$57.48</p>
<p>Stop: \$58, today's high at the open</p>
<p>Target: \$45, see Figure 2</p>
<p>Also, I've put in a hard stop for my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-rth-100-aug-09-85-put-3-30-mark-82-91/">RTH August put</a> too.</p>
<p>Update: I was trying to place a stop order just now and forgot to change
it from the default limit order to stop, so <strong>I accidentally sold my
puts with a horrible spread for \$6.01</strong>!</p>

triggered in the afternoon on the same day. I was taking a wait and see
approach when VNO pushed above \$55.40. Once my stop was hit, VNO
steamed upward without taking a breather. So I ended up having to ditch
my puts at a higher than expected loss. Total loss is about \$120 +
\$15.</p>
<p>I thought I was being safe already by <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-vno-100-aug-09-55-put-2-50-mark-54-60/">entering a bit later than
usual</a>. But what got me this time is
for failing to set a hard stop. When we dipped below \$54 momentarily in
the morning and then held a higher low, that should have been the first
warning. And when we held above \$54.50 for most of the day, that was
the second warning. Then when we broke above \$55, I should have dumped
my shorts.</p>
