            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Sold half of my DRYS today @ \$11.1103, which I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-200-drys-533/">bought for \$5.33</a>.
This is just to get my principle back on this first sign of weakness in
this rally. We tested the resistance at \$12 this morning on historic
volume. I think we will break above \$12 eventually. That's why I'm
still leaving the other half of my position in the game.</p>
<p>What's more concerning for me is the broad market itself. We are still
struggling to <em>break 900 and hold on to it</em>. From Figure 2, we see that
the market (S&amp;P) is in the middle of an important channel right now.
Breaking above 910 is good. Breaking below 885 is bad. We are definitely
in a trader's market these days, so buy-and-hold isn't a strategy to use
now. And since it's unclear to me which direction we'll be heading. I
feel safer to cash in my principle in DRYS now as it's a highly volatile
stock. I believe it will go up, but I can't dismiss the possibility of
it heading back down.</p>
<p>Now that my DRYS position is effectively free money, I can ride it out
if it becomes choppy from now on. After rocketing from \$4 to \$12 today
in like a week, I can't expect DRYS to keep pushing in one direction
even if I expect it to go up.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I bought some SKF today after being <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-30-dug-3163/">stopped out of DUG</a> to hedge my
longs. The low volume in the market made me believe this rally would not
follow through. In addition, the difficulty of S&amp;P to test 870 looked
like a good entry point at the time, Figure 1. Citigroup was also
struggling to break \$7.00 even though S&amp;P made a slightly higher high.
So I was worried about taking a hit for my longs if we're to go down
from here. That's why I made a position in the ultrashort. SKF looked
good because \$150 seemed like a good support and the financials are the
banes of this crash so far.</p>
<p>In hindsight, even the channel on SKF, Figure 2, shows we are in a
downtrend for SKF, so up for the market.</p>
<p>I picked up SKF at 14:28 and was stopped out at 14:54. The reason for my
exit was C breaking above \$7 and then kept on making new highs. My
mental stop was at \$145 too. I kept myself out for the last hour
promising that I would not enter short again unless C can stay below
\$7. That never happened and C closed at \$7.05.</p>

-2.0 trailing stop so that I don't have to keep an eye on it. And
\$31.70 was the low from yesterday. As you can see from Figure 1, DUG
has broken below my trendline cleanly today. I will not enter until
there's some good sign of weakness in the market. Figure 2 on the S&amp;P
internals shows good strength throughout today. However, it seems to be
weakening on the bump to 870 as I write this.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I sold 120 of my 366 shares of SLW just before 3pm today. I still have
246 shares. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-166-slw882-limit/">purchased 166 SLW shares way back before the crash</a> on
October 1 for ... gasp ... \$8.82. I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written about SLW</a> numerous
times and have swing traded options to make up for some of the loss
throughout these couple of months.</p>
<p>What prompted me to sell some SLW today is that Silver is up over \$1.0
to 10.487 yet SLW failed to hold on to its morning gain, see Figure 1
below. The line in the sand for me was the \$3.1 level as shown in the
hourly chart in Figure 2. Then later in the day, it failed to recapture
the \$3.0 level. I got out at \$2.90 as noted.</p>
<p>This dichotomy of rising silver price and falling SLW price shows
weakness on SLW's part. I'd like to think this is a good trade because I
had a plan and followed it. I have let my SLW shares lost 2/3 of its
value already. I am not going to let my bullish precious metal sentimet
affect my SLW trades like before.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>S&amp;P is up 50+ points today. We gapped up at the open, stayed in a
trading range for the day, then slowly rose up in the last hour, but
only to lose a small chunk and settled at 850, again. The volume has
been low throughout the day and the internals didn't look too good.
That's what prompted me to unload about half my positions in the last 45
minutes. The recent beating in my account certainly is making me being
very cautious now. I'd rather <strong>save my ammo to enter higher later when
we get confirmation for a rally than wait for one with bloated bullish
positions</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at the S&amp;P 500, TICK, and Advance-Decline line. Aside from the
open gap up peak, both the TICK and A-D line failed to impress
throughout the day. Actually, it was lack of strength in the numerous
840 tests and the weak 850 breakout about 3:20 that worried me. Notice
the lower lows in both the TICK and A-D line at the 840 and 850
breakouts in the chart below.</p>

<p>The first to go was -90 DELL @ 9.90 at 3:25pm for about a 50% loss. I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-90-dell-1649/">bought DELL at the beginning of October for \$16.49</a> and it has been
underperforming throughout the two months. There's been little volume
since I bought, up or down. Even with the exuberant buying on the market
today, DELL failed to break above \$10 (it did close at \$10.14). Most
important reason for me selling this long term holding now is that
there's very little volume even on this up day when everyone's expecting
a real bear rally.</p>

<p>Next up, I sold my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">C calls from the strangle placed Friday</a>. As I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-uyg-449/">said earlier in the day</a>, the news that the FED is bailing out
Citigroup has rocketed its share price from \$3.17 at my time of
purchase to \$6.50 on the morning rush. However, C share price eased
down throughout the day and failed to break \$6 with high volume. I sold
at about \$6.05. I purchased the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">+2 Dec 5 calls for \$0.79</a> and sold them for \$1.77. This was a
speculative play and I didn't want to be greedy. So I sold when C share
price showed it's lacking steam to continue to move up ahead.</p>

<p>Lastly, I sold my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-abb-100-dec-08-10-call-155/">+2 ABB Dec 10 calls purchased at \$1.55</a> for
\$1.70. A breakeven trade after commission. The drawdown was humongous
in this trade since I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/">missed some previous stops</a>. The ABB share
price action is a lot like DELL today, a lot of fireworks but no real
substance. Yes, the price is up a lot today, but there's no volume from
it. In particular, in the last 15 minute, ABB dived back down to its
major pivot point of \$11.10. I quickly unloaded my calls then.</p>

<p>Like everyone else, I am really hoping for a good bear rally. It would
do everyone, both bears and bulls, some good at this point. The thinking
is, after so many fake rallies lately, this one has to be it, right?
However, having learned my lesson in bottom picking in this bear market,
I'm putting my hope/logic aside and interpret what I see in front of me.
From today's price and volume movement, this rally doesn't seem like it
will follow through.</p>
<p>I do hope I'm wrong though, if we can hold the 845/840 level on the
S&amp;P500 tomorrow. Then I would be looking to add to my already 60% long
holdings.</p>

Friday</a> when the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/">call option was exercised</a>. The effective share
price I bought was \$3.55. I sold it for \$4.49 today. A profit of \$94

Clearly, the commission made this trade a bad one. I didn't know TOS
charge me \$15 for exercising options.</p>
<p>I sold at \$4.50 because it's a resistance level and we tested it a
couple times this morning without breaking it. Although the risk/reward
at \$4.50 still remains favourable, I sold because I don't want to use
margin money. As of this writing, UYG has broken \$4.50 to \$4.67. I
believe \$5.00 is a good target and possible \$5.7 in the near term.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I still have my trump card in the financials. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">C options
strangle</a> is doing quite well now that the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122753629931853007.html">government is pumping
money into Citigroup</a>.</p>
<p>Update: After writing a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/">big piece on trailing stop</a> yesterday, I totally forgot to apply it myself. I really
should have used a trailing stop in this case since I thought \$4.40 was
a good stop. UYG is now trading at \$4.85 without much drawdown. At
least this is a small position.</p>
