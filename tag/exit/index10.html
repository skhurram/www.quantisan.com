                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdchf-entry-10320-stop-10300/" rel='bookmark'>Paper trade:  USD/CHF entry 1.0320, stop 1.0300</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I figured I should write this sooner before the market moves more and
skew my thoughts on this entry. After my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdchf-out-at-1-03998-50-pips-and-1-03798-30-pips/">earlier entry in USD/CHF were
stopped</a> out this morning, I tried to enter once, got stopped out; and
then an even better setup appeared, so I entered again. See Figure 1.
This is a really awesome setup for the following 5 reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend is on our side as it's still pointing up.</li>
<li>Identical setup to last week's dive before the climb, same RSI, same
    candlestick</li>
<li>Bounced right at 1.031, which is at a longer term Fibonacci fan line
    as shown in Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Another support at round number 1.030, which is very near.</li>
<li>Good reward/risk ratio, see below for calculation.</li>
</ol>
<p>I entered 6000 units (2/3 position as usual) and placed the stop at
1.0300, just 20 pips away. USD/CHF climbed up to 1.0345 almost
immediately after my entry. So I moved my first stop to 1.0310
(Fibonacci level) for half my position. That got taken out minutes later
and it marked the bottom (for now) at 1.0309. I was a bit too hasten to
move my stop up for this part. See Figure 2 for my orders. One big
caveat to this entry is my tight stop at 1.0300. It is simply too
obvious of a stop price. I'd imagine the market would try to gun the
stops there before a run-up. However, if 1.030 breaks, it would ruin the
setup as described above. And if they're able to break that level, who
knows how far this can go further down. So I'm keeping my stop as is.
Anyway, I still have half of my initial position left. USD/CHF is
trading around 1.034. I don't think I'll do anything to this position
for now. I'm comfortable with just half position sitting in for the
weekend. Entry: 1.0320, Fib fan line support, see Fig 1. Stop 1: 1.031,
triggered already for a loss of 10 pips. Stop 2: 1.030, round number
support. Target: 1.038 - 1.040, starting point of this quick dive.
Reward/Risk = 60 / 20 = 3, right on the line of my goal. Although I am
secretly eyeing the 1.045 level as a target, I'll be cautious starting
from 1.038. Probably by setting a trailing stop if we do touch that. As
always, let's wait and see how this goes.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm all stopped out of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">USD/CHF positions from a couple of days
ago</a>. I considered re-entering when we failed to break 1.037 a few
minutes later. But the 1.04-1.043 range seemed heavy, so I postponed
that idea. About this trade, the maximum drawdown was terrific at a mere
0.12% (see stats below). I seem to do well with my entry. However, I'm
leaving profits on the table once again. For my second exit, USD/CHF
touched a high of 1.0451 but I was only able to get out at 1.03798.
Granted, this portion is supposed to be loose to capture bigger moves,
but that didn't happen. So once again, <strong>I need to work on my exit</strong>.
Another thing here is that my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">USD/CHF target of 1.045</a> was spot on. I wanted to exit half
my position at that level. But I couldn't figure out how to do both
target stop and stop loss at the same time after my entry order is sent.
This problem has been resolved by asking customer support at Oanda. I'm
not entering any more new trade (aside from the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-nzdusd-entry-stop-0-7040/">NZD/USD stink bid</a>
which I placed this morning) because it's Friday and I don't see anymore
obvious good setup across the board (a small board) for my 4h timeframe.
<strong>Update:</strong> Nevermind, I was eyeing 1.0350 when I got stopped out as a
entry point. USD/CHF just touched it as I'm writing this post. So I'm
back in now with a tight trailing stop... (and it doesn't seem to be
holding after just a few minutes... and it's stopped out for an
additional loss of \$4.86 on this tap.) Entry: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1-03498-stop-1-03240/">1.03498, 6000

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I went long USD/CAD this morning with 1/3 position when we bounced back
up to 1.0800 and then retraced to 1.075. It was stopped out about an
hour and a half later. In hindsight, this was not a good trade for one
major reason. <strong>I should not have gone against the short-term trend on a
weak support level even if the intermediate trend is on my back</strong>. I
should have at least waited for stronger support around 1.0650. Figure 1
is a chart of the 15-min USD/CAD with my orders marked. When USD/CAD
failed to break 1.0800, a major resistance, it was a sign that the short
term trend remains bearish. At least I entered a stop and didn't let the
loss accumulate. Below are the statistics for this trade. On another
note, my stink bid placed at 1.0666 this morning seems likely to be
triggered (USD/CAD is trading at 1.0679 as of this moment of writing).
My stop for that is 1.0600. This is a better entry because there's a
multi-day resistance at 1.0600 and crude is testing a significant \$70
resistance too. Although if I'm more conservative, I should be more
patient and wait for 1.0600 instead... So I'm only entering 1/3 position
for this instead of the 2/3 as in my strategy (revised since my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdcad-all-out-1-0872-196-6-pips-and-1-0821-145-6-pips/">last
paper trade in USD/CAD</a>). See Figure 2 for the support/resistance.
<strong>Update:</strong> I retracted my bid at 1.0666 because crude oil broke above
\$70 and USD/CAD hang on to 1.0672 or so for a few hours. If we do break
it, it would only create another short-term sell-off. So there's no
point in me having an entry just 6 pips below at 1.0666. It will just
get washed down when the support breaks. Entry: 1.07426, 3000 units

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>USD/CAD made a quick run to 1.10 and retraced back down to 1.08. Since
my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-usdcad-1-06754/">entry at 1.06754 almost two weeks ago</a>, there's been both
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-failing-to-break-above-a-short-term-downtrend/">run-down</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/us-dollar-vs-canadian-broke-above-resistance-after-fomc-and-before-g20/">run-up</a> as I have noted. Although this trade turned
out well with an average paper gain of 171.1 pips (see stats below), one
thing that I'd definitely need to work on is not giving back the profit.
For the first half of my position, USD/CAD topped at 1.0948 and I
existed at 1.0872, which is 0.71% of unrealized profit left on the
table. For the second half, USD/CAD topped at 1.0992 and I exited at
1.0821, which is a dismal 1.6% left on the table. I could have doubled
my gain if I can take my chips off the table at a better time.
Obviously, I still need a lot of work to do in sharpening my stops. For
that, I started to keep track of my trades using a detailed spreadsheet
that have custom macros to calculate my performance statistics. Some of
these numbers are displayed below. I will now focus on the <em>quality</em> of
a trade rather than just on the net outcome of a trade while I'm working
on improving my trading. I'll cover this topic another time once the
spreadsheet is done. I am still tweaking the formulas and format as I
record more trades in it. Entry: 1.06754, 5000 units Exit 1: 1.0872,
2500 units Exit 2: 1.0821, 2500 units Net: +196.6 pips and +145.6 pips
Time held: 159:27:00 and 256:14:00 Max. Drawdown %: <strong>0.12%</strong> (a very
good number) % from Max. Gain: <strong>0.71%</strong> and <strong>1.60%</strong> (not so good
numbers)</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Brunswick Corp. (BC) stayed above \$11.00 as we began the week. I placed
a stop at Friday's high before the open today to be executed at 10:30am.
When I got back at lunch, I found that my stop was triggered as soon as
it was sent. Luckily, it was also at the time when BC retraced the
open's gain slightly. So it was a good price to be out since BC has
closed above \$12 today (Figure 1). This trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-bc-100-oct-09-12-5-put-1-95-mark-10-81/">entered last Friday
before noon at 1.95</a>, when BC was trading at 10.81. This represents a
loss of \$65. For this particular trade, I adhered to my exit strategy
(even though it was a loss), so that's good. For the entry, I could have
waited later on in the day on Friday to see how the market performs as
we approached the end of the week. If I had done that, the reward/risk
would have been better. But I think I would have entered short anyway
since the sign were pointing downward when BC hung back to around \$11
at the close after breaking above \$11.20 intraday on good volume. And
the fact hat the market was consolidating too. Looking at the long term,
BC has retraced all its loss since the dive last year. For the market,
S&amp;P500 has etched higher today too but is still about 10 points below
last week's all-year high. The volume for the overall market is
noticeably lighter too. So this uptrend can possibly continue up as not
many is riding this move. We shall see how this goes. As can be seen
from Figure 2, BC at \$12 has some resistance above to \$13. For the
lower end of the range, we have \$9.60. A break below \$9.60 would
signal a stop of this recent bull train's momentum.</p>
