            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been trying to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/?s=bottom">catch falling knives</a> for a few weeks now.
Every time I think we're at a bottom, the market rally a bit to get my
hopes up and then continue to drift down more. In retrospect, there are
so many trading no-no's I have broken with that dangerous mentality. My
account is down significantly as of this writing and I have learned many
old and new lessons throughout these weeks. In fact, I have demonstrated
improving trading <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">technique</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1190/">psychology</a> even as I was losing
money overall (what an oxymoron). Rather I'm trying to comfort myself or
not, the fact is that losing money is simply unacceptable in trading. So
I will review these trades in this post and perhaps learn something from
them.</p>
<p>As the title suggest, this is a post for post-hoc analysis of the
options which I held into expiry (3 losing and 1 winning). I'll do this
chronologically. The longest Nov09 position I have is SLW Nov 2.5 Call.
I have been a big fan of SLW as I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">written and traded SLW numerous
times</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, I've annoted my charts
more than usual and will show more and write less in this post. I noted
my entry point in each trade, and labelled the stop and post-hoc <strong>ideal
exit/stop points</strong>.</p>

<p>My effective <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">entry point in my SLW Nov 2.5 Calls</a> were at SLW share
price of \$2.90 (SLW closed at \$2.81 Friday). I bought 2 Calls for
\$0.55 and at expiry, they are worth \$0.325. A loss of \$45 + \$15 for
commission as of this writing. I held on to my 2.5 calls and exercised
them, so +200 shares of SLW for me.</p>
<p>Next up is ABB on the same day. The share price for ABB was at \$10.31
when I entered. ABB closed Friday at \$9.95. I bougt the three ABB Nov
10 Calls for \$0.90. They are worth \$0.05 each. A total loss of \$255 +
\$15 for commission.</p>

<p>Then we have TCK entered at TCK share price of \$5.575. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-tck-100-nov-08-5-call-100/">bought two
TCK Nov 5 Calls for \$1.00</a> each and they are now worthless. A
complete wipeout of \$200 + \$15 commission.</p>

<p>Lastly, there's this puny winning day trade in the last 40 minute of
Friday. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-uyg-100-nov-08-3-call-55/">bought a UYG Nov 3 Call for \$0.55</a> and it expired for
\$0.95. A profit of \$40 - \$15 comission, so a total of +\$25 so far. I
held on to this call and exercised it. I have +100 shares of UYG to
carry over the weekend.</p>

<p>As you can see, <strong>if only I have used trailing stops, I could have held
onto some of the profits and not turn winning trades into a losing
ones</strong>. I didn't want to let the large swing in premiums stop me out
from a big rally. That's why I didn't use trailing stop. However, the
lack of subsequent follow-through and confirmation in the rally should
have been a glaring alarm sign. I should have put in trailing stops from
this lack of strength in the rally. <strong>Any counter-trend position should
be carefully managed with tighter than usual risk management</strong>.</p>
<p>I have let my <em>undying hope for a rally</em> clouded my judgement. This
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/move-from-certainty-to-curiosity-to-improve-your-trading/">stubborn need to be right</a> is a very fundamental psychological flaw
in trading. If I can't stop doing that in the future, I might as well
quit trading manually and focus on developing my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quantitative financial
engineering</a> work. However, as I have noted, I think I'm improving
lately and upon further reflection, I believe I have come up with a
potential methodology to correct myself in the act ... More on this as I
develop on this technique.</p>

<p>I have covered my FSLR Jan09 70 put as planned. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1320/">shorted it for
\$13.2</a> and covered it for \$11.90. An overnight profit of \$130 after
commission. The share price was about \$92 at the time of this trade. It
is now at \$88 as I type a few minutes later. I covered at a good time,
right at the peak of this morning gap up rush. Frankly, I'm just glad I
can cover it at a profit. I would have done the same even if it's a
loss. Better be small than big.</p>
<p>I believe my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1320/">original reasons for going long</a>
were sound for the <em>long</em> term, but I obtusely forget the fact that I
can't stand a huge potential drawdown. I am clearly still suffering from
this bottom-calling tendency. But at least I caught myself this time. I
think this is a good start to correct this costly habit.</p>
<p>Looking at the trend in this week's down leg indicate we can have a
downside to \$80 for ESLR. Entering long at yeseterday was a low
probability trade. I should have waited til \$80 or better yet, wait for
a confirmation for a rally.</p>

<p>Well that was fast. This trade lasted only 36 minutes. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-325/">shorted for
\$3.25</a> and was stopped out for \$3.50. A lost of \$40 with
commission. I dumped my holding when my stop was hit this time. No
question asked.</p>
<p>The market rallied fast in the last 20 minutes to close at 858.82 for
S&amp;P 500. Let's see how the market does tomorrow.</p>

<p>I covered my last short put. Bought ABB Nov 12.5 put for \$1.95 (bid:
\$1.8, ask \$2.05 at the time). I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-170/">shorted this ABB put at \$1.70</a>. As
I've opined yesterday, things don't look good on the market. Despite <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">my
earlier optimism for a bear rally</a>, the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/monday-after-the-last-minute-market-dive-outlook-for-the-rest-of-the-day/">market obviously haven't
followed through</a>. The reality is that there's a good possibility of
another market crash at this critical support level. Thus, I have exited
today on signs of weakness.</p>
<p>On the broad market, the S&amp;P failed to push through the morning when I
made this trade. Figure 2 shows a double top at 865 with corresponding
double top in the TICK (neutral read) and lower Advance-Decline line
(bearish read).</p>
<p>Another point is that ABB today merely filled the down gap, and this
second retest of 865 on S&amp;P only led to a lower low with lower volume.
In terms of intraday move, this is very bearish.</p>
<p>So rather than sit tight and hope for the best, I unloaded this last
short put as planned to reduce my downside risk.</p>
<p>I still have plenty of long calls in ABB and others if we do rally from
here. I am still very bullish on ABB from its fundamental and signs of
big block accumulations recently. Just that with only 3 more days until
options expiration, I can't risk having the shares put to me now that
I'm low on cash from all the greedy calls buying in the last few days.</p>
