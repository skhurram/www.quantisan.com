            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update at Noon: Looks like I am wrong. LLL.TO is testing its recent high
at \$40.50. However, volume is rather low up to now. I'm out my
Lululemon (LLL.TO) position because of market softness. Bonds (TLT) are
holding a support level. EUR/USD is struggling to hold above 1.27. And
the oversea markets (Asia and Europe) are weak overnight. Perhaps the
market is getting ready to catapult up. Perhaps it is not. But I'm not
going to place my bet on anything as I don't have a clue where it's
about to go at the moment. So I am stopping out of this position at
breakeven. Preserving capital. Moreover, recent price move in Lululemon
(LULU on Nasdaq) is disappointing. Despite the market marking new
consecutive highs for the past few days, LLL is stuck in a rut as shown
in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Purchase price of these shares were <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-140-lll-to-39-86/">\$39.86 from a week ago</a>.</p>
<p>Exact return is (\$40 - \$39.86) * 140 = \$19.60 - \$9.90 commission =
\$9.70. In any case, I'm all cash in my account now. At least I've free
myself from the market for the next two weeks during my trip to Hong
Kong. Here's an updated view of the daily chart of LLL.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>What I thought would be an intermediate term hold turns out to have
lasted mere minutes. I bought Teck Cominco (TCK.B.TO) after a small
bounce at \$34 support during lunch today. Figure 1 shows the clear
support level. Also note the fact that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-43-mark-16-27-loss-0-5/">my recent shorts haven't been
working</a>, so I thought I would go with the flow and go long. [caption

immediately after my long entry (something I haven't done in a while).
TCK cracked the \$34 support swiftly to \$33.80, my mental support. My
alert was sounded and I kept an eye on it afterward. But then not long
after \$33.80, my hard stop at \$33.70 was filled and TCK traded down to
\$33.66 or so. It has now stabilized around \$33.80 as of 2pm. Figure 2
shows the intraday chart of TCK.B.TO. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

for this trade is (\$33.68 - \$34.10) * 250 = -\$105 - \$4.95 * 2
commission = -\$114.90 = -1.2% of account. My account is now
experiencing a 3.4% drawdown since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">the high on June 8th</a>. I can't
help but feel that this was a stop hunt. TCK is creeping higher at the
moment. However, as my initial position was stopped out, I am not going
to re-enter this trade just yet. Let's see what it does near the close
today. I am labelling this particular trade as a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">bad trade</a> because
my stop was clearly too tight based on the time frame that I am
observing. I should have reduced my position size and widened my stop to
account for the recent volatility. Update: TCK gapped down 7% the day
after. At least my exit was timely.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Not much is happening in the market as it is trading in a tight range.
This is not good for my options as the time delta will slowly eating
away my premium. So I've decided to unload this position at a small loss
just now as the market is testing support across the board. The U.S.
dollar index is testing \$86 resistance. Oil is testing \$78 support.
S&amp;P500 is testing the 1070 support zone. Purchase price for these puts
were <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-48-mark-16-38/">\$1.48 per contract last Wednesday</a>. When Manulife Financial
(MFC.TO) was trading at 16.38. Loss is (\$1.48 - \$1.43) * 100 * 4 =
\$20 - \$13.95 * 2 commission = \$47.90 = 0.5% of account. As you can
see, the commission is horrible on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">RRSP trading account at
Questrade</a>. I will wind down trading options from now on and move back
to trading forex in the summer. My live account at <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> is
ready... Update: The market finally broke support the day after this
exit. This was not a good exit as I lost patience. MFC is testing \$16
support on June 29th opening hour and I don't expect it to hold. This
could turn out to be a winner if I had held.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just got psyched out by the Euro rise and oil strength. So I closed my
oil short. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-34/">purchase price was \$10.34</a> two days ago on Tuesday.
Final result in this trade is (\$10.04 - \$10.34) - \$4.95 x 2
commission = -\$75 - \$9.90 = \$84.90 = 0.88% of RRSP trading account.
Normally I would wait for a retracement to exit, but the high volume of
U.S. DB Oil Fund (DBO) at the close yesterday plus the lack of weakness
at the open today (Figure 1) makes me uneasy. Note that even though
EUR/USD is making new highs today, the U.S. equity market isn't
following suit. In particular, S&amp;P500 is still below previous resistance
level around 1115. This may be a bear trap. Or, it could be a short term
term. I couldn't tell. So I'm staying on the sideline for now and will
just be watching the market play itself out. As you can see from my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trading log</a>, my last three trades were not profitable (2 losses and
1 breakeven). As such, I am putting myself on a cautionary mode until I
can grow my account back to my previous high point.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>My Barrick Gold short isn't working as I hoped. My puts premium is
moving closer to breakeven to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-abx-10oct-puts-46-00-4-00-mark-44-67/">purchase price of \$4.00</a>.
Furthermore, the market is cracking above <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-34/">resistance levels today</a>.
In particular, ABX.TO is marking a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern
after a test of its 50-day moving average support (Figure 1). Yes I
know, there's a massive resistance at \$44.00 for ABX.TO. But... As much
as I'd like to believe in the bears, this short position is not safe
anymore. I can't let a positive trade turn negative. It's better to miss
an opportunity than lose money. So I'm ditching this now to reduce my
risks at above breakeven seeing that I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-34/">another smaller short
position in play</a>. Which is underwater at the
close, by the way. My return on this trade is (\$4.15 - \$4.00) * 100
* 3 contracts = \$45 - \$12.95 x 2 commissions = \$19.10 I'm just
lightly short now and mostly in cash.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Oil broke above \$75 resistance overnight. So my Horizons BetaPro Crude
Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) gapped down below my 10.60 mental stop at the
open. I watched the U.S. DB Oil Fund (DBO) price actions this morning to
time my exit as shown on Figure 1. While the price gapped beyond my
stop, the volume was weak this morning (Figure 1). HOD.TO traded below
\$10.40 on the gap momentum but I held on because of the low volume.
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="U.S. DB Oil Fund
(DBO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-06-10-DBO_intra.gif" />][][/caption] I waited and waited until DBO traded near
24.50. This is a short term support level as shown in Figure 1. This was
also the equivalent of my previous stop loss for HOD.TO at \$10.60. Even
though I believe this is a stop hunt for the oil shorts because of the
lackluster volume, I am not one to argue with my plan. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-92/">pegged my
mental stop at 10.60 at the time of entry</a>. HOD.TO broke below my stop
price. I had three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ditch it at whatever price I can get.</li>
<li>Exit on retracement to my original stop price.</li>
<li>Exit on break-even.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the reasons as discussed above, I picked option #2. Here's a
calculation of my loss for this trade. (\$10.59 - \$10.92) * 250 shares
= -\$82.5 - \$9.90 commission = -\$92.40 = -0.95% loss of account total.
In any case, it looks as though my initial low-ball bid at 10.50 was a
good entry point. I shouldn't have gotten impatient and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-92/">entered at a
short-term resistance price level</a>.</p>
