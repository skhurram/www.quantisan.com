            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just closed my USO long position. I bought back the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-175/">puts that I wrote
for \$1.75 about a month ago</a>. This represents a realized profit of
\$280 - \$15 for commission. I actually wanted to get out of this
position last Friday when USO tested \$30. But <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/buy-stop-2-uso-100-may-09-28-put-65/">my stop was never
triggered</a> so I held on to the options through the weekend, thinking
I'd benefit from the time decay anyway.</p>
<p>Today, USO reached \$30.50 with some relatively low volume. \$30.50 also
mark the top of a recent up channel (Figure 2). With my limited profit
potential at this point, I'm inclined to take my profit than risk a
retracement.</p>
<p>This trade has certainly been a roller coaster ride. The <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/review-of-positions-srs-and-uso/">price of USO
didn't move up as planned</a>. It actually took a dive but picked itself
up back to around my entry price on a slow up move. In the end, it was
the time decay of the options that helped to make this supposedly losing
trade into a winning one.</p>
<p>This is another example to favour writing puts instead of buying shares
in this volatile market condition.</p>
<p>On another note, I'll look into USL instead of USO in the future for any
Oil trade. The April roll over contango took a stab at the USO price
last month. I was lucky for the short put strategy saving me.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I placed <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/huge-opening-swing-with-scsc-after-earnings-report/">my stop at \$22.70 as planned</a> today and it was triggered at
10:41 am. The exit price ended up at \$23.52 from a quick run. But SCSC
further pushed along and closed at \$24.14.</p>
<p>I should have noticed from the 200 week MA that SCSC has been pretty
strong lately. I should have only entered when the long term trend is in
sync with my position.</p>
<p>Anyway, after running through a few more charts, it seems that my stock
filter is giving a contrarian indication. There's still a lot of work to
do to develop this new system.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I placed a stop buy this morning for FAZ just above its intraday
resistance along with a stop just below its intraday low. The entry
triggered before lunch (11:44) but then I got stopped out at 12:43pm.
This is a short term play as FAZ was hit hard today with WFC's
"unexpected" profit. But I noticed WFC was unable to sustain its opening
high and continued to drift lower all morning while S&amp;P 500 is hanging
below 850. I interpreted that as a divergence and entered FAZ.</p>
<p>However, FAZ has tanked further and its trading at 12.82 as I write
this. Good that I tacked on a hard stop with my order.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I ditched my GE calls at the open today when the S&amp;P 500 made a gap up
and GE gapped open at \$11.10. These options were purchased at 0.49. So
that's a loss of \$56.35 + \$15 for commission. However, I'm definitely
out too early as GE is hanging around \$11.50 as I'm writing this.</p>
<p>The reason for this quick exit is because the long weekend starts
tomorrow so the options premium is sure to drop. Since I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-5-ge-100-apr-09-11-put-79/">cleared my
puts for GE on Tuesday</a> already, I'm out of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">my GE strangle</a>
entirely now.</p>
<p>In addition to a bad entry on my part, the time decay really ate up my
premiums. I should review the details of this trade another time. I am
off to a long weekend soon.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm out the short side of my GE strangle. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">purchased these puts at
0.872</a>. I loss about \$41 for this trade alone. Doesn't look too bad,
but remember, I still have my calls to get rid of, and those are the
real losers. I'm down \$172 for the calls at this moment.</p>
<p>The reason for ditching my GE puts now is simply because it is refusing
to go down. In fact, it is outperforming the market for the last few
days even as we're retracing in the market, see Figure 1.<em>If a ship is
refusing to sink in a storm, it is surely a sign of strength.</em> GE has
filled a gap with low volume, Figure 2. It could very well shoot back up
from here.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is a long weekend and there's probably going to be
little action all week. The <strong>time decay is going to really hurt me</strong> as
we approach expiration soon. It has been dropping steadily already. Time
is definitely not on my side for this trade. So I've decided to ditch it
on signs of strength of GE.</p>
<p>At this point, I would like to clear this off of my desk and look for a
re-entry.</p>

This gap down today only attracted some light volume. And we're hitting
the support of \$100. Light volume on a test of a strong support isn't
good. So I'm lightening my short here since I still have my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">GE
strangle</a> to live off of in case we're tanking further as I suspect.
Call me chicken, but <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/goldman-sachs-is-it-up-or-is-it-down/">this position is a bit too heavy</a> to be
comfortable.</p>
