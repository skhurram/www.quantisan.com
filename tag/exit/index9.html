            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>420 pips in my demo account to be exact. Still, I feel very lucky. In
this post, I will review why I entered this position, why I added to it,
and why I exited. The goal is for myself to learn from what works and
what can I do to improve on this trade given some hindsight advantage.</p>
<h3>The Signal</h3>
<p>See Figure 1 on the daily chart of AUDJPY (first entry price pointed
with blue arrow). Notice the lower highs, with the 2nd high inside my
fChannel and the 3rd (last, just before entry) high below a yet longer
term fChannel. Plus 1 point for the lower highs and another 1 point for
the highs moving into the channels. Two points here. [caption id=""

<h3>The Choice</h3>
<p>While both AUDJPY and AUDUSD seemed promising. I focused on AUDJPY
because the Yen seemed better poised for strength. I discussed my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-use-fx-futures-to-narrow-down-which-forex-pair-to-trade/">method of choosing a better counter currency for trading</a> in another
post, so I won't discuss it here. However, as this trade became more and
more obvious and into the green, I diversified my short by adding shorts
in NZDJPY and NZDUSD. Those two netted around +100 and +250 pips also.
Another plus 1 point for picking and choosing.</p>
<h3>The Confirmation</h3>
<p>What really gave me confidence in this trade is the price action in gold
in comparison to the Aussie. Figure 2 shows the Gold Futures price (/GC,
lower left) and Australian dollar futures (/6A, middle left). Notice
that gold has been trending up steadily for days but the Aussie made a
lower low. That's a negative divergence. Plus 1 point.</p>

gold, and crude oil</a>[/caption]</p>
<h3>The Timing</h3>
<p>For timing this trade, I observed the intraday movement of AUDJPY,
EURUSD, and other related pairs. The most obvious sign of Aussie
weakness was from comparing the price action of EURUSD and AUDJPY. The
3-hour charts of EURUSD and AUDJPY are shown in Figures 3 and 4,
respectively. Notice on Nov 24 and 25, EURUSD trended higher and made a
new high. At the same time, AUDJPY barely moved on the 24th and squeezed
even more on 25th. The difference was even more noticeable when I was
watching the 30-min at the time. I had thought that my datafeed was
lagging when AUDJPY barely moved yet EURUSD was rocketing up. Plus 1
point for the 3-hour price action and then another 1 point for the
30-minute price action (not shown).</p>

<h3>The Entries and Exits</h3>
<p>Six points total for the trade, time to establish a position. You can
see my orders in Figure 4 above. My first entry was Nov 25 15:12 at
81.37 with a half position. It is marked by a yellow triangle at the
cliff beforethe dive (how lucky). I added another half that evening
23:06 at 79.94. I was waiting for a 50% retracement to 80.50 to add but
that didn't seem to be happening. So I added 1/2 when AUDJPY failed to
break 80.0 with a strategy to add another at 80.50. But 80.50 never
happened and it took another dive. My exits are determined at the time
as usual by using stops. I simply keep moving the stop along and
narrowing them once we break support level. After the move became
vertical, I zoomed out to the daily chart to view potential targets. The
77.0 and 76.00 levels (as shown in Figure 1) became my not-be-greedy
targets. I had my stops really tight at those point and even had a take
profit set for half the position at 76.0, but that level wasn't tested
before I got stopped out. The two red dots at 77.17 and 77.08 are my
stopped exits as shown in Figure 4's last bar.</p>
<h3>The Conclusion</h3>
<p>What made this lucky trade happen is that I had spent a lot of time
analyzing it from different perspectives and watching the intraday price
actions for days. I also took my time to scale in and out to minimize my
risk. To make this a habit, I will use this point counting system from
now on to help me analyze more and trade less. One thing that I'd like
to improve upon is to be more aggressive on a winning position. How?
That will be saved for another post when I figured it out.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-audjpy-81-22-sl-80-99-tp-82-50/">AUD/JPY long from yesterday</a> got stopped out after I moved the
exit stop to a breakeven price. Then I gave it another try once AUD/JPY
had a quick dip and recovered to 81.30 level around Tokyo noon. That has
been a time of large moves recently. My entries and exits are shown on
the 3-hour chart of AUD/JPY in Figure 1. The problem with this entry is
that the downside momentum is stronger than I thought. While being wrong
is perfectly fine in trading, I need to put more thoughts in short-term
analysis to improve my probability. In addition to the analysis which
I've done as previously discussed for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-audjpy-81-22-sl-80-99-tp-82-50/">my entry</a>, I am going to take into account yet another shorter
timeframe for my trade timing. Figure 2 shows a 30-minute chart of
AUD/JPY. Referring to Figure 2, the two blue triangles are my entries.
The two red dots are my exits from stops. In hindsight, my first entry
was about an hour early. Short-term resistance was obvious at 81.60 but
there is no short-term support shown. I should have entered either above
the resistance or when we failed to break 81.10 support the second time.
For the next few hours from 12:00 to midnight, AUD/JPY is testing that
long term resistance fChannel as shown in Figure 2. We can see that the
trendline is imposing a strong resistance on the pair as it hasn't been
able to hold more than a few bars above it. The second entry at 81.60 is
acceptable. AUD/JPY tested 81.30 again but managed to jump right back
up. Particularly if we look at the 3-hour chart of Figure 1, it would
seem that this is merely a short-term retracement from the 82.00
resistance. A stop at 81.30 as I have done has limited risk and it would
mark the line in the sand. If I'm to try going long this pair again with
this setup, I would use a half sized position only as the setup has
failed me twice already. But as can be seen in Figure 2, AUD/JPY is
failing 81.30 this morning again. This is an obvious sign of weakness in
the pair. So that's it for me for now to go long in this pair. A more
detailed log of my trades can be found on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log page</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Seeing that this is my first commitment after the big drawdown, I'll
bring back my tradition of writing a post to log my rationale and market
conditions on this entry for later review. I sifted through the weekly
charts of all pairs on my watch-list tonight and found that USD/CHF long
is the most promising. Figure 1 shows my daily chart for the setup and
Figure 2 is a 3-hour chart with my entry timing. Let's talk about Figure
1 first. USD/CHF is making a triple bottom with a positive divergence as
shown. I have also marked the current major support at 1.0010. USD/CHF
has trade below it for about a week now but failed to break any lower.
Today is the first day when we've opened somewhat above it. Secondly,
note that we have broken above a descending channel as shown in Figure
1. USD/CHF has also tested the 1.0010 support twice already at both
sides of that channel. And accompanied with a positive divergence as I
said. The major caution as shown in Figure 1 is that we're still trading
below the 10-day ma. As for the entry timing, observe Figure 2. Notice
that USD/CHF just made a higher low outside and above the descending
fChannel (the two thicker brown lines). This is the signal for entry.
Note that the fChannel is my proprietary channel. This trade is
initiated according to my new Forex Trend Fading (FTF) setup. Position
size: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">100%</span>,
50%<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> </span> Entry: 1.0122,
from fRays signal. Stop: 1.0060, below major support Target: 1.0225,
first major resistance, ease off some at that point, add more above it.
Reward / Risk = 103 / 62 = 1.66 \&lt; 3. Not not good enough for my usual
R/R target, but I've been considering lowering it to 1.5. So lets see if
an R/R of 1.5 is a good enough number. I would have been more
comfortable with a 2.0 though. Anyway, let's see how this goes. Update:
I took half of it off at breakeven because of the lower R/R and the new
setup. Only 50% in this trade now. I'm looking to add a EUR or JPY cross
for my other half allocation. Update 11/19: I'm stopped out of this
position @ 1.0150 for +27 pips.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>A profitable trade is definitely a good thing. But when you sit idly to
see good profits turn into great profits, and then doing nothing to lock
in some of that windfall, it is time to review your trading strategy.
That is exactly what I have done last night when I saw my AUD/JPY shorts
took a 150 pips dive at the Sydney open to pass a strong support. And it
wasn't AUD/JPY only, all my 4 other pairs also pushed about 100 pips
deeper into the green to test their respective supports. But as quickly
as those unrealized profits appeared, it was quicker that they
evaporated. While I had <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">5 positions</a> last night and they all fit this
scenario, I will use my AUD/JPY short for this particular case study as
it was the most dramatic and easy to read. Here is a brief summary of my
AUD/JPY shorts. Figure 1 is a 3-hour chart of AUD/JPY showing my entries
and exits. I entered twice on Oct 29 (83.76 and 82.47, marked by yellow
triangles) and was stopped out with profits on Oct 31 and Nov 2 (81.7
and 81, marked by red dots). The trades ended up +147 and +206 pips with
1/2 the position size each. As shown in Figure 1, I did manage to
capture most of the down move nonetheless. So these weren't badly
executed at all. (I used my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">FTCS 0.1</a> as the trading setup, so I
won't go into the logic behind my entries and exits here.) What I'd like
to point out though is the long tail candlestick poking through the
support at 80.0. From Figure 2 daily chart, it is apparent that 80.0 for
AUD/JPY is a strong support from prior congestions. Not to mention that
it's a nice whole number. As such, it was naive of me to think that
AUD/JPY could break and maintain this depressed level on thin volume on
a Sunday (EST) Sydney open. Secondly, also note that in Figure 2, the
fall in price of AUD/JPY is quite extended as shown by the RSI's dive
from 90+ to about 40. Even if the pair is poised for further weakness,
there's bound to be some catch of breath before it can take on a strong
support. From the above 2 observations, which I did see at the time,
it's evident that I should have taken some profits (i.e. half of my
positions) when I had the chance. I knew in my mind that 80.0 was hard
to break, but instead of exiting on target, I merely tightened my stops
in hoping for more gains. Don't get me wrong. Using stops for entries
and exits have served me well and it will still remain my primary trade
order method. But if I'm to improve, to go from +200 pips to +300 pips
in a trade, I need to be able to spot and exploit other tools at my
disposal when extraordinary occasions such as last night's appear. So
what can I do in the future to prevent this from happening again? With 2
simple additions to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading strategy</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a profit target and take some chips off when the market reaches
    target at extreme conditions.</li>
<li>Keep these profit targets up-to-date according to the trading setup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that this is analogous to what I have already been doing with my
stops by moving them closeras the price action dictates. However, <strong>one
important caveat</strong> to this technique is that this should never override
the fundamental trading rule of letting profits run. I will only take
profits at a target if the price is severely over-extended according to
my trading setup. In any case, as [Ancient_Warrior][] wrote to me on
<a href="http://twitter.com/Quantisan">Twitter</a>, "<span><span>Well don't 'kick yourself' too much for 200
pip gains please! lol"</span></span></p>
