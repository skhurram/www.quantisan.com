            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>CAD/JPY reached my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-cadjpy-86-88-stop-86-10-target-88-0/">target of 88.00 last Friday</a>. It broke through
88.00 nicely and tested 88.50 on Tokyo open just now. I decided to book
my profit in the demo account on this CAD/JPY long position entered at
86.88 and 87.87. See Figure 1 for the 3-hour chart with the entries and
exits marked. Main reason for my cold feet is that there's a lot of
resistance on CAD/JPY above 88.50, all the way to 90.70, from the daily
chart (not shown). I couldn't tell if CAD/JPY will continue pushing
upward or retrace. So I'm booking my profit now to observe the price
action from the sideline. This position has turned out +40 pips more
than I expected, so I'm trying not to be too greedy in this volatile
time. The net profit on this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trade</a> amounts to +0.3% of my demo
account. The yellow triangle in Figure 1 shows my exit. I risked 0.1% on
the initial entry (first blue triangle). Then added 70% more to the
position above a weak resistance level (second blue triangle) and moved
the stop on the initial size to breakeven.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Finally a profitable trade in my USDCAD short after being stopped out a
few times. My decision last week to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/usdcad-short-target-hit-1-0581-trying-something-new-to-hold-for-longer/">hold this for longer</a> after
USDCAD touched my target paid off. I moved my stop closer last Thursday
evening and the order got filled on Friday. However, as I type this on
the following Monday, USDCAD is trading even lower at 1.0478. It looks
as though my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">original target of 1.0415</a> is in the cards. Even though
this is a profitable trade with a 0.17% gain in my demo account, there
is one major flaw with this short USDCAD play. I was not able to squeeze
more out of this profitable move. As I've said, this short took a few
tries. In fact, if we consider all the entires and exits of this play.
My stopped out losses totaled 0.29% and my single win here is merely
0.17%. So I'm actually at a net loss of 0.12% from all these work. My
win/loss rate is about 40% based on my review of recent forex trades. I
was able to edge out more than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">10% profit in four months</a> because
when I am wrong, I take small steps. But when I'm right, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">pile into a
position</a>. Ever since my trading environment has changed, I've been
trying to trade a longer timeframe. This USDCAD short is my first
attempt on a new strategy. Evidently, I will need to re-think and
re-learn what I've become accustomed to in the past few months. One of
the necessary trait of a successful trader is to be able to adapt.
Markets change. Traders need to evolve with the markets or they will
become obsolete. This will be a good test of myself to see if I can
re-invent myself to adapt to a changing trading environment. [caption

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well this was awful. USDCAD continued on a rampage upward and I was
caught on the wrong side of the fence. Total loss for this was 0.12% of
my account. At least I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">was light in it</a>. In retrospect, I broke my
own rule and didn't enter at one of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">4 fundamental entry points</a>.
However, after some bear rampage throughout the markets today
(Bloomberg: [Stocks Plunge on Concern Rising Debt, Job Losses Threaten
Global Recovery][]), USDCAD is at the top of my channel as shown in
Figure 1 below. So while my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">previous entry</a>
was early. USDCAD at this price is a good short. I will take it slow
this time by setting a limit order below current support on the 4-hour
at 1.0680, with a stop at 1.0750. And then adding a second chunk at
1.0640, my stopped out price. As is customarily lately, I am only
risking 0.1% of my account on the initial order. On a weekly chart,
1.0750 to 1.0810 is obviously a strong resistance for the USDCAD. It is
a congestion zone in 2007 and 2008. Then USDCAD spent the last quarter
of 2009 trying to break this resistance to no avail. But who knows,
perhaps USDCAD has had enough and it will break this resistance
decisively soon. That's why I'm only betting on this reversal with
limited risk. It's just a matter of wait and see now.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Just closed my GBPJPY long at 146.42 for around +140 pips average gain,
or 0.4% in the account balance. Damn good for a 24 hours holding. Obama
just finished his State of The Union address at the moment. I am not
impressed. Still all talk of change but nothing concrete yet. Anyway,
that's beside the point in this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a>. 146.50 price level for
GBPJPY is the 10 day moving average. It has also been a strong support
back in late December. This should be a good resistance level. My guess
is that GBPJPY should stall, or even retrace, here for a while. Thus I'm
taking profit at this price as shown in Figure 1 (yellow triangle). I
still believe my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-gbpjpy-144-24-stop-143-60-target-148/">bullish setup from yesterday</a> is still good. So I'll
be watching this pair for a re-entry. Update: I re-entered at <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-gbpjpy-145-24-stop-144-70-target-148/">145.24
the next day</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I was saying earlier this week, I have been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">stockpiling in EUR/CHF
short</a> in my demo account (Fig. 1). Aside from that, I've also stocked
up some GBP/CHF shorts this week (Fig. 2). Both positions are now closed
because of my adjusted stops. These positions have single-handedly
lifted me half way out of a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/work-harder-trade-fewer-in-a-long-and-excruciating-trading-drawdown/">deep drawdown</a> in my demo account. These
trades netted me about 1.5% in my demo funds. Yes, you read that right,
a meager 1.5% gain and I'm calling these my best trades. No, it's not
like I haven't had <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">good trades</a> in terms of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-eurjpy-135-00-500-1-pips/">money made</a> or the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/eurusd-95-pips-in-2-hours-an-example-of-swing-and-day-trade-convergence/">fastest pips</a>. These shorts aren't even close from just looking at
the numbers. Heck, it would have been a lot more profitable if I shorted
Euro and Pound with a Dollar or Yen counter this week. So why? If you
read my post on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/analysing-monthly-forex-trading-performance-in-changing-market-conditions/">measuring trading performance</a>, you may recall that I
don't measure success by profit alone. It is performance <em>in terms of</em>
amount risked that matters in trading. These shorts in EUR/CHF and
GBP/CHF are my best forex trades ever (in my 4 months of fx trading so
far) simply because I risked no more than 0.2% at any given time (most
of the time there were no explicit risk as my stops have locked in
profits) to make that 1.5%. 1.5% gained by risking maximum of 0.2% gives
a Reward/Risk ratio of 1.5/0.2 = 7.5! There were several occasions when
I had doubts to add to my position or were pondering about taking
profits to settle my worries. Despite all of that, I soldiered on,
managed my stops like they were my babies, and piled more into the
position according to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">my plan</a> and
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC/">trading setup</a> (Fig. 1). By the time I started scaling out, I have
built my biggest (non-scalp) position. That gave me a lot of freedom in
scaling out as you can see on my exits shown in Figure 1 (red dots).
This Reward/Risk ratio is the highest I have achieved in recent memory.
I have always read about 10x or even 20x trades at the <a href="http://www.smbtraining.com/blog/">SMB Capital
blog</a>. Those guys can achieve this type of reward/risk ratio day in
and day out (I'm not affiliated with them). I guess that's the
difference between the pros and me. This is definitely something I am
strifing to do myself. <strong>Executing consistently high reward/risk
trades.</strong> How I might do that? By continuing to improve on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">trading
skills</a> and my understanding of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex markets</a>. [caption id=""

I took profit a few pips earlier than I wanted because the bounce from
0.9025 fooled me. As you can see from Figure 1, AUD/USD is resting on
0.9000 support as I predicted. Now the million dollar question is,
should I go long in this currency pair because of the super long term
trend as I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-change-of-wind-for-australian-dollar-shorted-audusd-0-9183-and-audcad-0-9546/">discussed in my previous post</a>? That brown support line in which AUD/USD is resting on now
(Fig. 1) extends all the way back to April 2008. However, there's also a
nearby support at <a href="http://www.tradergav.com/2010/01/22/is-it-time-now-audusd-is-in-the-zone/">0.8945 as shown on Gav's Trading Blog</a>. Since I
don't trade such a long term timeframe, I will be more conservative on
this by watching how the price reacts in the short term at this 0.9000
level. Gold also broke below 1100 but is holding above its own support
around 1080-1090 too. Both markets are finding support at current
prices. Let's see how well they last. I am flat in this pair until
things are more clear to me. On another note, this isn't exactly a
victory as I've been trying to short the Aussie for days. You would have
been better flipping a coin in comparison to my success rate lately.
I've lost more than I have gained on this move so far. In fact, I am
still on handicap mode (half position size) as I'm <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/work-harder-trade-fewer-in-a-long-and-excruciating-trading-drawdown/">still in a 3%
drawdown</a> as shown in my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trading log</a>. However, I am slowly
crawling my way out with limited risk and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade">profitable trades</a> such as
this.</p>
