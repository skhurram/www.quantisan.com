<p>The market broke my intraday support line today (pink line, first
graph). What appeared to be a good Monday turned out to be very
disappointing. I cleared the last of my short puts (i.e. long) about 5
seconds before the close when the market gained some footing. These
plays are purely for risk management purposes, each individual stock
looks ok to me to be accumulating at this level. But I'm in for the
swing trade and it haven't worked out. So I'm selling them all mainly
because the overall market looks weak.</p>
<p>To illustrate, today's intraday market data looked particularly bad. I
thought the market would turnaround after the TICK retested a -1200 low
for the day at noon on lower price, but the price continued to drift
down afterward. Then the 2pm rally didn't even break 930 (resistance
from yesterday) too. That was the last draw for me and I decided to exit
all risky positions from then on to minimize my risk. So I covered all
my options into the close.</p>
<p>The first of which was Dec SLW 5 put at 15:48 for \$1.70, which I
[bought at \$1.55][]. I still have my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-166-slw882-limit/">166 shares of SLW</a>, so it's an
obvious choice for me to unload the options. I don't want to be too
heavy on precious metal for now. SLW is still holding the \$3.4 level
and marked a higher low in the afternoon. So it's actually looking good.</p>

<p>Next I sold FRO at 15:59:27. The low of today looks like a test of a
daily trendline, pink line below on the right daily graph (Update: I
forgot to attach the graph. I added it a day later below). I normally
would have only sold if it breaks it, but again, the market looks bad.
So a retest of \$30 (highest volume in recent months) seems possible. I
covered the [FRO short puts bought at \$7.90][] for \$8.00. On another
note, I mistakenly placed a sell order on the put rather than a buy (to
cover) at \$8.10. So I quickly covered that accidental trade at \$8.30
regardless of that fact that FRO was moving up at that time. I've
learned my lesson in accidental orders and would cover immediately
regardless. I won't try to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-58-caf-2889-limit/">convince myself like my CAF trade</a>.</p>

<p>I covered my Nov [WFC short put bought at \$3.60][] for \$3.00 at
15:59:55. Fee \$7.50.</p>
<p>I almost didn't want to give up my WFC position. It was the strongest
and the one most profitable of my Friday's swing trades. In particular,
last Friday's turnaround has by far the most volume in several months.
The \$28.0 support looks almost impenetrable. Indeed, today's low of
\$28.04 looks safe and we only tested it at very low volume. Indeed, I
really don't think we'll see this low again in the short term. Looking
at this more carefully now, maybe I should leave it open ... Oh well, I
can always get back in.</p>

<p>I've sold my [CAF position bought at \$28.89][] for \$21.69. A loss of
about \$430. I placed a limit order, and only 56 of the 58 went through.
I'll assume my 2 remaining shares will go through some time today (it
has gone through as I'm writing this). Fee \$5.</p>
<p>CAF gapped open about \$2 today due to this weekend's news of [China's
plan for a stimulus package of about US\$586 billion][]. However, CAF
seem to be being faded on this news. The total downtick volume looks
significant.</p>
<p>On the other hand, FXP (UltraShort China) looks to be on the rise. A
break of above \$70 would be very bullish for it.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_665" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>My bullish view on China in the long term still remains strong. However,
I don't think we're in a time for buy-and-hold strategy anymore. This is
definitely a trader's market and I intend to put my money for swing
trading opportunities. Even though I sold at a significant loss and a
return of CAF to \$25 level seems likely in the short term, I believe I
will lose even more in opportunity cost if my fund is tied with CAF. So
I'm exiting on this weekend news and price strength.</p>

<p>Covered my [short puts on ESLR shorted at \$1.60][] yesterday for

<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-dell-100-dec-08-13-put-180/">unloaded my DELL options</a> a bit too early in hindsight. DELL was

<p>Covered my [short put on DELL shorted at \$1.29][] yesterday now bought
back for \$1.80. A loss of 51 cents. That works out to about \$200 for
my position. Things didn't look good for DELL after it broke \$13. I
covered today at the open when we gapped up a bit. The open gap up
volume was low compared to its previous similar priced \$12 level. DELL
has been my weakest position so far. I might unload the rest of my
shares at a loss on the next rally.</p>
<p>Three main reasons for my cover, 1) uncomfortable with the position due
to price-volume weakness recently, 2) risk management in preparation for
a possible test of 870 and below on the S&amp;P, and 3) loading my ammo by
selling the underperformers and adding to my stronger positions on
weakness if we fall from here.</p>

<p>Covered my [short puts SLW @ \$4.00][] for \$3.40 today. Fee \$7.50.</p>
<p>This is to reduce my risk on the current weak precious metal market.
Silver is failing to break above \$10.6 so far. Gold is down \$14 or so
to below \$750, an important support level.</p>
<p>The weakness seen today after the election is likely a shakeout for an
imminent rally. However, my leveraged position in SLW is too risky due
to weakness in both the equity and precious metal markets, even for the
short term. So I'm unloading it for now to wait for a re-entry. My
strategy with the options is to hold it as short as possible for the
most profit. So I'll be taking swing positions and trade in and out.</p>
<p>In any case, I still have my SLW shares to ride the wave if we do make a
move.</p>
<p>Update: S&amp;P is down 33 to 972 from around 988 when I sold. Yet, SLW is
holding up nicely. This is a very good sign for SLW.</p>

<p>Sold my SKF from a cost basis of [\$102.60 from yesterday][] (fee \$5).
The ETF still seem poised to go higher in the near term. However, since
I'll be off to Taiwan for a few days, I don't want to leave the position
unattended as it is highly volatile. Ideally, I'd like to wait for the
price to reach at least \$110 or later in the week to sell it. Still, I
am satisfied with my small gain and would not risk more for a little
gain (I considered placing a limit sell at \$110).</p>
<p>I still believe SKF has a lot of potential for a much higher price in
the coming weeks to about > \$120 based on the fundamentals (i.e. the
<a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/09/i-got-75b-but-i.html">laughable spin by the media on Buffett's deal with Goldman Sach</a>) and
