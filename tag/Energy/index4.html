            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am shorting Natural Gas via the Horizons 2x leveraged bearish ETF
(HND.TO). The U.S. Energy Information Association (EIA) released their
<a href="http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html">weekly natural gas storage report</a> yesterday. The underground storage
amount is only 4.9% above last year's level. However, as <a href="http://shockedinvestor.blogspot.com/2010/05/why-natural-gas-should-be-shorted-or.html">Shocked
Investor points out</a>, last year's amount was a record high. So 4.9%
above last year's is even higher. Figure 1 shows the two year graph of
natural gas storage and the 5-year avearge channel. [caption id=""

futures was testing \$4.50 resistance yesterday (Figure 2) within a
prolonged downtrend. As such, both fundamental and technical shows
bearishness. So I shorted natural gas with HND.TO today on retracement
to \$7.25 support (Figure 3). This retracement is due to HND meeting
resistance at \$7.50 (50% Fibonacci level on the \$8 to \$7 drop this
week).</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) position this morning as crude
oil broke below \$80 briefly and the Dollar Index rose above \$84.
My<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">original target was \$27</a> for this short. But considering the fact
that I mistakenly doubled my position size, I am closing this trade a
step above at this \$27.50 support level (see Figure 1 for CVE.TO
support lines). Furthermore, the time decay on the options premium is
accelerating so I needed to sell this soon. The final profit on this
position is \$858.15 (after \$63.80 commission), or just over 10% in my
RRSP account. Although this trade is profitable, it is a horrible trade
for the following reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>I accidentally <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-just-made-a-grave-fundamental-mistake-in-my-cve-to-trade/">bought more contracts when I intended to sell</a>.</li>
<li>Not correcting my mistake immediately.</li>
<li>I risked too much at 3% (of account) initially and then 10% after my
    mistake.</li>
<li>Peak drawdown was over \$1000 (12.5%) at one time.</li>
<li>Too eager to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-10jul17-puts-30-00-mx-2-45-mark-28-64/">add to my position once it moved</a>.</li>
<li>Reward-to-Risk ratio is less than 1.0, so I threw big money for
    smaller gain.</li>
<li>Commission ends up eating 7% of profit away. That is too much.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, I made one, two, ... seven too many mistakes in this
trade. Luckily, I did manage to do some things right.</p>
<ol>
<li>Patience. There were a few days when the price moved sideway. I
    didn't succumb to my emotions and dump the shares when it was nerve
    whacking to hold onto a loss. The price was still below my mental
    stop so I held.</li>
<li>After the initial shock of doubling my position as the price moved
    away, I mentally accepted my loss and was able to study the market
    objectively since.</li>
<li>Didn't take profit too early once the price moved back in my favour
    this week.</li>
</ol>
<p>I won't be as lucky every time. Learn from my mistakes and exploit on my
strengths. That is the lesson from this trade.</p>

today (Apr 22). I doubled down on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">my short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO)
position</a> this morning. The price of CVE.TO moved in my favour a day
after my initial short entry. It then bounced back up strongly (about
2.5% rise in a day) yesterday to test \$29.50. However, it has backed
down since. The fact that it didn't touch the \$30 price level is a good
sign. Crude Oil (CL on NYMEX) made a similar move. It tested the 50%
Fibonacci resistance at 84.5 and backed down. This is again a good sign
for my short as it signals the downtrend is a go.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Cenovus Energy
Inc. (CVE.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-21-CVE-TO.png" />][][/caption] However, crude prices became very
choppy in the afternoon today as shown in Figure 2. So perhaps there is
still room to move up. I will keep an eye on the 84.50 and 85.50
resistances for crude and 29.50 and 30.00 for CVE.TO in the coming days.

this addition to my short position.</p>
<ol>
<li>this morning, the Bank of Canada gave strong hint that they will
    raise interest rate in June. However, USDCAD made a marginally new
    low briefly and then bounced back up above parity. This is bullish
    for USDCAD.</li>
<li>EnCana earnings topped estimates but the stock dived after the
    opening rush with at least 3 times morning volume as compared to the
    past five days. ECA.TO is hanging on to the 31.5 support level
    before noon but closed above it today. This is not a good sign for
    the energy sector on the TSX.</li>
</ol>
<p>A confirmation with this down move would be a break of the recent low at
\$28 for CVE.TO and \$82 for crude oil.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I made my first trade in my RRSP! It is a short on Cenovus Energy
(CVE.TO) via buying puts options. I chose the July expiry with the
intention to dispose of this position in May. Two reasons for that. 1)
Before time decay accelerates (about 60 days prior to expiry), and 2)
before the summer starts (low volatility in summer, premiums are
discounted). The following facts/opinions constituted my decision for
this entry.</p>
<ol>
<li>TSX index is toppy according to weekly RSI</li>
<li>TSX is losing steam this week versus the S&amp;P 500 (see Figure 1), but
    this is probably due to the forex market</li>
<li>MX Implied Volatility Index is testing 10.00 support again</li>
<li>Energy sector is weakest of all 3 prominent sectors on TSX (Energy,
    Financial, Material) in intermediate term</li>
<li>Oil is showing negative divergence on weekly chart</li>
<li>U.S. dollar index is in uptrend and testing support at 80</li>
<li>USD/CAD is testing major support at parity</li>
<li>CVE.TO looks weakest amongst top 5 traded Oil/Gas on TSX (for
    liquidity)</li>
<li>Negative divergence as seen on CVE.TO chart (Figure 2)</li>
<li>\$30 is a strong resistance level (Figure 2)</li>
<li>CVE.TO v. Crude Oil chart shows an intermediate term steady down
    trend</li>
</ol>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="512" caption="TSX Composite v.
S&amp;P 500"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-14-TSX-SPX.png" />][][/caption] Stop: \$32. Target: \$27. Commission paid
is \$12.95 on this trade (double that for a round trip). A rough
estimate of the premium by May expiry if CVE.TO is priced at \$32 then
would be \$0.80. Thus, I am risking about \$240 of my \$8,000 account in
this trade on a worst case scenario. Which is 3% of my RRSP account.
This is <em>significantly</em> more than my usual risk appetite (less than 0.2%
per trade in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex trading</a>). But any less would be pointless due to
the high relative commission for options. I had the choice of shorting
the market using options or leveraged bear ETF. The deteriorating value
of a bear ETF made it less favourable for holding for more than a few
days. So I traded options due to a lack of choices in my RRSP. Anyway,
that's my thought on this. Yet nothing matters but the price. Let's wait
and see how this goes. I plan to make one trade per quarter in my RRSP.
This one is for Q2.</p>
