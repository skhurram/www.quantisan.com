topping COT (<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm">CFTC: Commitments of Traders</a>) lagging open interest
data (bottom of Fig. 1). I waited for a breakdown in the hourly chart
(Fig. 2) to make my entry into this short. The market has been coiling
up for the entire month of October. Something big is about to happen
sooner or later. Perhaps the U.S. midterm election tomorrow can finally
move this market? Stop is at 8.80. Risk is (\$9.03 - \$8.80) * 250 =
\$57.50 + \$9.90 commission = \$67.40 = 0.68% of account. Position size
is still small with this lack of market volume.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update: Crude is making a dive. This might be the move that I waited but
got stopped out. I shorted crude oil on Friday afternoon below the 82
resistance. It was an undocumented trade. Now I am closing at a loss.
It's a slap on the hand for breaking my own trading rules. Oil broke
above 82 over the weekend. Fortunately, the opening gap was filled
before noon and I took the opportunity to cover my short. I was down 1%
at the open. Good thing I didn't panic and waited patiently (with a hard
stop just below the opening low) for a more rational exit. My planned
stop was \$9.15, the opening low was \$8.87, and I covered at \$9.12.
Just a tad under my plan but a lot higher than the low so far. Figure 1
is a chart of U.S. Oil Fund (USO) at the time of my exit. I traded the
Horizons BetaPro Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) as a vehicle for shorting
crude oil. The chart of USO is a better proxy of crude oil prices as
it's a few magnitudes higher volume (i.e. more popular) than HOD.TO.
From the looks of it, I will stay on the sideline until at least the
midterm election in the United States next week. Loss for this trade is
(\$9.12 - \$9.29) * 300 = -\$51 - \$9.90 commission = -\$60.90 = -0.6%.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I got whipsawed out of my crude oil short as the market consolidates.
Seeing that the G20 is meeting in Seoul today and tomorrow, not much is
happening on this flat Friday. EUR/USD is in a 100 pips range. S&amp;P 500
is in a 5 points range. Maybe something will happen near the close, but
I won't be around for it as I have no position in the market anymore.
Crude oil is still looking bearish though as it is crawling on its short
term support line (Fig. 1). Perhaps my stop was just too tight as I
moved it up a couple of times to lock in some profits. Profit is
(<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-300-hod-to-9-19-stop-9-05/">\$9.40</a> - \$9.19) * 300 = \$63 - \$9.90 commission = \$53.10 = 0.5%

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I shorted some crude oil to hedge my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-300-ven-to-8-95-stop-8-80/">gold miner long</a> right at 2 pm
today. EURUSD looks to be trading in a range. And since FOMC and G20 are
right around the corner, I am not expecting the market to do anything
drastic (i.e. breakout). So I am shorting commodity (to long US dollar)
as EUR/USD is at the top of its channel (Fig. 1). I picked Horizons
BetaPro Oil Bear Plus ETF (HOD.TO) because it's one of the most active
reverse ETF on the TSX. I considered buying HFD.TO (for shorting
financials) but that one has a fraction of the volume of HOD.TO. The
falling star candle right below the 82.50 resistance on the hourly chart
of crude oil (Fig. 2) is also a factor in my timing. Risk is (\$9.19 -
\$9.05) * 300 = \$42 + \$9.90 commission = \$51.90 = 0.5% of account.
Figures 1 and 2 were captured at the time of entry. The markets are
still hanging on the ceiling approaching the close. [caption id=""

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just got psyched out by the Euro rise and oil strength. So I closed my
oil short. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-hod-to-10-34/">purchase price was \$10.34</a> two days ago on Tuesday.
Final result in this trade is (\$10.04 - \$10.34) - \$4.95 x 2
commission = -\$75 - \$9.90 = \$84.90 = 0.88% of RRSP trading account.
Normally I would wait for a retracement to exit, but the high volume of
U.S. DB Oil Fund (DBO) at the close yesterday plus the lack of weakness
at the open today (Figure 1) makes me uneasy. Note that even though
EUR/USD is making new highs today, the U.S. equity market isn't
following suit. In particular, S&amp;P500 is still below previous resistance
level around 1115. This may be a bear trap. Or, it could be a short term
term. I couldn't tell. So I'm staying on the sideline for now and will
just be watching the market play itself out. As you can see from my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trading log</a>, my last three trades were not profitable (2 losses and
1 breakeven). As such, I am putting myself on a cautionary mode until I
can grow my account back to my previous high point.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Current state of affair: S&amp;P500 testing 1108 resistance. Oil testing
77.50 resitance. EUR/USD testing 1.2350 resistance. USD/CAD marking
higher bottom at 1.0280, low of day was 1.0260. I am shorting oil
(HOD.TO) here because it looks like that the rally is non-sustainable in
the short term as we are testing resistances across the board within a
longer term downtrend. Moreover, the reward/risk is good at this point
since the stops are clear (e.g. the various resistance price levels in
first paragraph). Figure 1 is the long term chart of U.S. DB Oil Fund
(DBO). It shows DBO is at the top of a congestion zone in a longer term
down trend.</p>

<p>Evidently, my stop is DBO pass \$25. That is around \$10.00 for HOD.TO.</p>
<p>Thus, my risk is (\$10.34 - \$10.00) * 250 = \$85 + \$9.90 commission =
\$94.90 = 0.98% of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade RRSP trading account</a>.</p>
<p>Frankly, my conviction in this trade isn't that strong. But as the setup
is there and the reward/risk is good, I am taking a light stab at it.</p>
