            <div class="article-content"> <p>I placed a stop buy this morning for FAZ just above its intraday
resistance along with a stop just below its intraday low. The entry
triggered before lunch (11:44) but then I got stopped out at 12:43pm.
This is a short term play as FAZ was hit hard today with WFC's
"unexpected" profit. But I noticed WFC was unable to sustain its opening
high and continued to drift lower all morning while S&amp;P 500 is hanging
below 850. I interpreted that as a divergence and entered FAZ.</p>
<p>However, FAZ has tanked further and its trading at 12.82 as I write
this. Good that I tacked on a hard stop with my order.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I entered a long position in US Oil Fund (USO) today by writing puts.
(CBOE has a good article about put writing strategy, <a href="http://www.cboe.com/micro/put/PUTIndexEnnisKnupp.pdf">PDF here</a>) At
least this time, time decay will be on my side. Seeing that USO traded
down to 28.40's in the pre-market, I placed a limit order at 8am at
2.05, but it was never triggered when I got back to my desk at 10:30. NY
crude oil futures (QM) went just below \$48 but it bounced back pretty
quick. This led to my conviction that Oil has strength underneath its
belt.</p>
<p>As I suggested in the weekly review, I'm to look for values in the
tech/telecom. But I also noted Basic Materials as a viable alternative.
Well, I read through a few charts last night, namely ADBE, INTC, and
CHL, but as nice as they were, they aren't screaming buys at this point
based on the indicators and chart.</p>
<p>I also considered precious metals using SLW, but Gold/Silver seems to be
at a pivot level at this point. So it's anybody's game for them.</p>
<p>Then I read a couple of blog posts regarding USO/UCO from some
respectable traders. Figure 1 and Figure 2 shows my own analysis. The
pattern looks good and the indicators are in buy zone too. On top of
that, the overnight and premarket moves as I explained above looked good
too. That's when I decided to enter.</p>

<p>Target: From Figure 2, \$32 is first level. Then \$34.</p>
<p>Stop: Recent lows about \$28.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Since I wrote puts on this, time is on my side. The time
decay in options will add to my bottom line. And because we long weekend
coming, the options premium is going to drop and bunch as well as low
activity level expected this week. I will try to hold this until next
week and hopefully longer.</p>
<p>On a sidenote, I feel that I've learned from my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-5-ge-100-apr-09-11-put-79/">recent mistakes</a> of
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-31-srs-4808/">entering too early</a> and demonstrated patience and discipline in this
entry. In particular, I <strong>waited til the morning and watched it bounce
on support before placing a limit order</strong>.</p>
<p>USO touched \$29 and retraced to close its intra-day gap when I entered
this position. It just glided over the support and bounced right back.
That was very bullish in the short term. As I'm writing this, USO
continued its climb to \$29.80 now.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>S&amp;P 500 at 840 looks like a strong resistance so far. Volume is light
today. In addition, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">my short, GE</a>, is still below its \$11
resistance. And the finanacials isn't moving much.</p>
<p>Target: \$85, around the 200d MA and my trendline as shown, Figure 1
right.</p>
<p>Stop: around \$45 - \$46. Or S&amp;P 500 staying above 850.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This rally in the market looks a bit over stretched based
on the indicators. We've been going up and up since the beginning of
March. I still believe we're in a long term downtrend. That's why I'm
shorting this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-is-looking-ready-to-continue-its-bear-rally/">counter-trend rally</a>. And today looks like a good day.</p>
<p>Update: I seem to have a thing for picking my stops. SRS just glazed
below \$45 and then bounced back to above \$46. My stops typically mark
the turning point. In other words, I'm usually in too early. So if I
just set my entry price to my stops instead and let the price come to
me, then that might be a better entry for me. Better yet, <strong>before
entering a position, wait for the stock to hit my mental stops and watch
how it performs</strong>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I was saying this morning, I placed an order before going to work for
a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/general-electric-the-next-aig/">Apr09 11/10 strangle on General Electric</a> (GE). My limit was at
\$1.31 (total) but the morning mark started at \$1.37 and kept creeping
up. I waited until 10 am and GE slowly gained in price. It stayed above
\$11 shortly and so I checked the strangle price on the 12/11 instead.
It was about \$1.40 too. So I just changed my order from 11/10 to 12/11
and upped my limit to meet the mid spread.</p>
<p>The risk profile for 12/11 is definitely different than 11/10. 11/10
would have been a good neutral position because GE is obviously
congested around the \$10.xx range. The 12/11 range is more short-heavy
because GE was only around \$11.07 when I entered. It's at the top of a
trading range. However, I took it anyway because I'm actually leaning to
the short side, in case you haven't noticed...</p>
<p>As you can see from Figure 1, daily on left and weekly on right, \$10.5
is a major long term pivot point. We are testing it at the moment on
weak volumn. Figure 2 shows the hourly on left and daily on right. As I
was saying this morning, GE's rally in March looks weaker as compared to
S&amp;P 500. The 10d MA haven't even crossed the 40d MA yet. Add to that,
last time the indicators were at this almost overbought level was last
year in the \$15 range. You can see what happened to that afterward. GE
skidded down to \$6.</p>
<p>However, we have broken that long term downtrend, see Figure 3. And
we're forming a long flag. This is definitely a glaringly bullish sign.
After all, we can't keep using the same channel forever.</p>
<p>Rather long or short, the important point is that GE is at a major
junction right now. Although I'm favouring the short side, but from
observing the action of the market in the past few days, there's also a
good chance GE will get lifted along with the rest of the market soon.
That's why I've put on a strangle to take advantage of both the long and
the short prospects.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Once again, I find myself on the other side of the fence. I entered a
short at 10:42am today thinking the gap up is unsustainable. Well, not
only has S&amp;P500 broken 800, it's now resting above 820. Goldman Sachs
(GS) was about 106.50 when I entered the short. GS closed at 111.93
today. I'm down \$210 already. If GS can stay above this 200 day MA at
\$110 later tomorrow, then I'm out.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1125" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="S&amp;P 500 ETF"]<img alt="S&amp;P 500 ETF" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/2009-03-23-spy.png" title="2009-03-23-spy" />[/caption]</p>

<p>As you can see, GS went vertical upward once it broke the morning
resistance at \$17.30. The reason for my entry in the morning was
because GS seemed like it was having difficulty breaking \$17.
Furthermore, S&amp;P 500 also seemed hesitant around 800. So I guessed it'd
be reasonable to see a pullback.</p>
<p>However, I failed to take into account today's humongous gap up open. It
would have been counter-productive if we're to close the gap on the
weekend's hype up. This is pretty much a reverse of what we've seen
seeing for the past few months. Panic begets panic. But in today's case,
it's panic of missing the rally train that'll fuel this possibly new leg
of a rally.</p>
<p>My second mistake is trading on lack of information. I traded using the
mobile platform and by just looking at the Google Finance charts. If I
had access to my intraday sentiment chart, I could have easily seen that
the morning momentum remained strong even when S&amp;P was stalling around
800.</p>
<p>Lastly, I really should stick to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/market%20analysis/">my own analysis</a> and not trade on a
spontaneous urge. I did say in the morning that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/beginning-of-another-bull-phase-asian-markets-are-on-fire/">we'll break down if we
fail to maintain 800</a>. Even at the time of my short entry, we were
indeed holding on to the 800 zone. Thus, I have basically shot myself in
the foot for not listening to myself.</p> </div>
