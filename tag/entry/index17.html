            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have moved up my entry/exit stops for GE once again for a short
position. The <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/ge-short-stop-entry-13-14/">analysis remains the same as before</a>.</p>
<p>Short entry stop: \$13.93</p>
<p>Exit stop: \$14.13, intraday support as of now</p>
<p>Target: \$12.5, I've raised it to a short term support (Figure 1, on
hourly chart) from a previous intermediate term target.</p>
<p>Reward / Risk = 1.43 / 0.2 = 7.15</p>
<p>I seriously considered entering long into SLW instead. But with Gold
hitting resistance at 940, it's better to wait until it broke above it
before joining the run.</p>
<p>Update: My entry stop order was triggered at 12:01 pm. I have shorted 74
shares of GE @ 13.93. Because of the verocity of the intraday down move
(GE moved from \$14.13 to \$13.90 in 20 minutes), I've moved my exit
stop to \$14.23 expecting some sort of retracement to wipe the bears.</p>
<p>Update 2: I've moved my exit stop down to \$14.20 just so my R/R can be
above 5.0.</p>
<p>Update May 21: GE tanked over 3% on the open. I've tightened my exit
stop slightly to \$13.90. I'm inclined to move it closer to the mark
later today after seeing how it moves intraday. This trade is working
well so far.</p>
<p>Update: After a quick peek at 11:10am, I've moved my stop to \$13.75. GE
is hanging around \$13.30 this morning. Next up at \$13.50 is a
significant short term resistance. My \$13.75 resistance is the one
after that, and it's also the top of today's gap down open. So if it
gets taken out today, then this break down is very questionable. My
intention is to hold this for a swing trade, so I don't want to trade
too much.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm giving my GE short another try since being <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/ge-short-stop-entry-13-00/">stopped out this
morning</a>. I have considered VE, USO, and OIH as alternatives for my
short position. But GE offers the least resistance on the way down.
Actually, USO and OIH seem decent, but USO is hard to borrow and OIH's
reward/risk isn't as good.</p>
<p>Short stop entry: \$13.14, obvious intraday support at \$13.15 from the
minute chart (not shown)</p>
<p>Exit stop: \$13.50</p>
<p>Target: \$10, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/ge-short-stop-entry-13-00/">same target as last week</a>.</p>
<p>Reward / Risk = 3.14 / 0.36 = 8.72 > 5 (<strong>I am raising my R/R
threshold</strong> for now because of the volatility)</p>
<p>However, I doubt my entry stop would be triggered seeing how strong
today's up move is. The upward momentum seem pretty strong to me with a
strong positive average TICK and the price is holding even at the low
TICKS so far (Figure 3).</p>
<p>Update May 19: This entry stop didn't get triggered yesterday. I am
givingi it another try today again with a short stop entry @ \$13.14.
But I moved my stop a bit higher to \$13.60, the support for this
morning. The reward/risk should be still above 5 for this. Today seem to
be a range-bound day for the market. So I didn't move my entry up as
I've pondered about using \$13.40 as entry instead. I only want to enter
when the trend is clear to minimize trading.</p>
<p>Update: I've upped my stops to \$13.30 for short entry and \$13.76 for
exit to correspond with the now elevated level of GE (topping around
\$13.80 as we speak) and the not that strong of a rally in the market
based on intraday sentiments.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've entered a short stop order just now set at \$13.00. GE is hovering
above \$13.10 now. S&amp;P500 bounced back about 1.3% today, as of this
writing, after yesterday's raid. However, S&amp;P500 merely tested 900 and
failed to go above it. This is definitely a strong sign for the bears.</p>
<p>Thus, I have decided to add to my short with GE. Why GE? See for
yourself in the figures below. It satisfy my usual criteria for a setup.
In addition, the risk/reward is great!</p>
<p>Entry stop: \$13.00.</p>
<p>Exit stop: \$13.30, short term resistance.</p>
<p>Target: \$10, nice round number just above the long term trendline.</p>
<p>Reward / risk = \$3 / \$0.30 = 10 > 3.</p>
<p>In Figure 1, note the symmetry in the daily chart. The test of
resistance below \$15 failed miserably. Also note the Chaikin in the
weekly for a huge negative divergence.</p>
<p>For Figure 3, observe that the recent uptrend is breaking. My entry of
\$13 is at the 25% point within the channel and it's a recent support.</p>
<p>Update: My order is filled at 15:38 for average of \$13.0042308 for 78
shares.</p>
<p>Update 2: I was stopped out at \$13.30 on Monday, May 18 at 10:23 am.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Here's another <strong>paper trade</strong>. I've been trying this new strategy a
couple of times now, although it has generated 2 entry orders, none were
triggered so far (the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-50-scsc-2352/">SCSC trade</a> was from version 1, I'm at version
1.1 now). This is mostly because I've been entering shorts but the
market has been chugging upward like a relentless train. It's not that
I'm not keeping an open mind, but at this point, I haven't been able to
spot a good long trade.</p>
<p>Here are my logic for this play.</p>
<p>​1. We are still in a long term bear market. Although we're definitely
in an intermediate up trend at the moment.</p>
<p>​2. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) is a real estate play. Everyone knows
real estate stocks are in a severe bear trend. That's inline with the
direction of this play.</p>
<p>​3. VNO is testing the lower boundary of a congestion zone between
\$50-\$60.</p>
<p>​4. VNO's weekly indicators look bearish. And its daily ones look way
overbought.</p>
<p>​5. I am entering below its current up channel and below a support at
\$49.76.</p>
<p>​6. Reward/Risk of 7.07/1.90 = 3.72</p>
<p>Points 1-5 setup a favourable probability of this trade. Point 6 is the
reward/risk.</p>
<p>Entry stop: \$49.70</p>
<p>Exit stop: \$51.60</p>
<p>Target: \$42.63</p>
<p>The target I'm setting is a long term support from December of 2008. It
is also above the 25% intermediate term upward channel established from
March 2009, the bounce from its low. And it is at the 50% Fibonacci
retracement level from its recent run.</p>
<p>Update: My entry was triggered at 9:34 a.m. I have 25 shares of VNO
shorted at \$49.70 on paper now.</p>
<p>Update2: VNO almost touched \$52 on Friday May 8, so my position was
stopped out. I will probably put on another trade as VNO came back down
to below \$50 on Monday today.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>In my <a href="/about/">About page</a>, I summarized my trading history. You'll no doubt
see that between now and then, I admitted that I plundered my trading
account twice. Needless to say, that was a memorable period in my life.
The easy money from my lucky early years bit back hard and were taken
away within months. I'm surprised at myself why I'm even back at this
game now. There's a reason why I'm bringing this up. No, I am not broke
again. I only commit what I can lose in trading now. Still, I am aware
that I need to do a lot better in terms of risk management and
discipline before I can become a decent trader. But I digressed. You
see, like a dead pirate clinging on to his treasure, I've never let go
of those shares from that trade that broke me. As of this writing, I
still have a sizable shares of EMFP that I purchased from 2006 for
average of $1.23. For the record, here are my 3 entries:</p>
<ol>
<li>November 9, 2006 for 3500 shares at $0.77</li>
<li>November 30, 2006 for 9512 shares at $0.56</li>
<li>December 31, 2006 for 34695 shares at $1.46</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, comparing the dates and entry prices with the chart of Figure
1, it seems that my record is wrong because the trading prices on those
dates are way off. I will need to dig up some paper and check my record.
Anyway, my average price is correct at $1.23. For the first few months
of the share price dive, I was so naive that I thought the stock was
<em>cheap</em>. Then once reality sets in, I was just in shock that I didn't do
anything about it. By then, it was too late to savage anything
worthwhile.</p>
<p>As you can see from Figure 1, the move from $2.00 to $0.20
took 1 year. Since then, I just wrote this position off in my mind and
left the shares to collect dust. As you can see, EMFP even dipped to
$0.01 last year. My intention is to unload it in a later year when I
need a tax break. However, this week, EMFP moved from $0.07 to $0.35
and closed at $0.20.</p>
<p>You see, EMFP, or Emergency Filtration Products
Inc., markets a product called NanoMask that has been independently
tested to be effective against influenza and other viruses as a face
mask. With the recent talk of a global pandemic because of the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-04-28-swine-flu_N.htm">swine flu scare</a>, it's clear to see why there's renewed interest in EMFP.</p>
<p>In fact, the volume has spiked to about 2 million yesterday and almost 1
million shares today. There were days and weeks with no share traded at
all for EMFP in the past year. I am not so naive anymore to think EMFP
may climb back to its former glory. However, I hope EMFP can stir up
some more interest and trading volume, just so I can finish the fight
once and for all and close this embarassing trade in my log book. So,
I'd like to start this trade log and put EMFP back on my radar. I should
have unloaded a chunk of my holding yesterday when EMFP stayed around
$0.25. </p>
<p>However, I thought that I've waited this long, I might as well
let this flu panic play out and give EMFP more time to do something.
This is the first of my mistake, greed. This could very well cost me my
last chance to ditch this. My reason for holding is that we've hit the
200 day MA at $0.35 yesterday (Figure 2), so a bounce back was
expected.</p>
<p>Then today, EMFP held above the $0.13 support (low was
$0.14) on the retracement. With the still relatively low volume, this
stock is swinging like a wild bull. So large trading ranges is a given.
There are definitely a lot of resistance at $0.30. Yet, we have
established an up trend since the bounce from $0.01. This recent gap up
at huge volume would look good if EMFP can break above this up trend
with this momentum. Otherwise, breaking below $0.13 support would lead
this back to the coffin. Anyway, it's too early to tell. I usually say
watch the price levels at this point, however, in this case, I say that
it's more important to watch the volume. A sustained level of volume in
EMFP means there's finally some interest. And since we're pretty much at
rock bottom for the price, volume would lead to higher prices.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am experimenting with a new trading strategy. This is a log for a
<strong>paper trade</strong> I'm taking using this strategy for the first time.</p>
<p>The new stock filter as part of this new strategy generated a list of
stocks yesterday based on options volatility. Then I hand picked
ScanSource (SCSC) in particular to watch today as it looked to be
forming a basic setup where I can recognize.</p>
<p>To be clear, the signal is for short. So this is a setup for a short
entry. Following my newly etched 3 rules, I'm not jumping in with a
market order. Instead, I'll be setting up a short entry stop and
attaching it with an exit stop on the order.</p>
<p>Following <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/end-of-the-6-week-rally-and-back-with-the-year-long-beartoday/">Monday's epic dive</a> and Tuesday's rebound, the market has
closed below 845 on Wednesday. In particular, the late day dive is
looking good for the bear. Let's see if we can break below 835 tomorrow.
In any case, I don't want to digress into a market analysis here. Just
note that for the short and intermediate terms, the market seem to be
going down. Thus, I'm looking for shorting opportunities.</p>
<p>Back to SCSC. Notice the negative divergence on the daily and weekly
indicators. Also notice that \$22.70 is a long term resistance from last
October. Thus, I'm setting a stop at \$22.70 for this trade.</p>
<p>Secondly, when should I enter? I have given the entry more leeway since
we're in a choppy market. Also, I would like to enter at an obvious
point when the stock is starting to tank. So there's a higher
probability of success. I chose the entry stop at \$21.40. It is the top
for a previous run-up on April 3. See figure 2.</p>
<p>My target is marked on Figure 2 at \$18.50. It was a major support for
January and February before the run down into the abyss for SCSC. Also,
I took into account the Stochastic information. SCSC has been in an
overbought level on the daily for almost a month now (along with the
rest of the market). The previous support point according to the
stochastic was in early February, which had a range around \$18 to \$20.
Furthermore, \$18.30 is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level if we're to
go down.</p>
<p>The risk taken for this trade is \$22.7 - \$21.4 = \$1.30</p>
<p>The reward is \$21.4 - \$18.5 = \$2.90</p>
<p>Reward/Risk = 2.23</p>
<p>At 2.23, the reward/risk isn't that good. I would like to aim for at
least a 3-fold return. However, I'll let this go this time because I'm
only experimenting with this strategy. So I just want to see how it goes
and learn from it.</p>
<p>I've set my <strong>simulated order</strong> to be submitted after 10am tomorrow for
50 shares (about \$1000 paper money). We'll see what happens.</p>
<p>Update: The short entry stop order executed at 10:01:59 am and shorted
50 shares of SCSC at \$21.36, simulated.</p>
