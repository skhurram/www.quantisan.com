            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm long Ventana Gold Corp. (VEN.TO), a junior gold mining company.
Here's a look at gold (Figure 1) and the junior gold mining company
index (GDXJ, Figure 2).</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570"
caption="Gold"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-15-Gold.png" />][][/caption] [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

<p>Both figures are from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/finviz/">Finviz</a>.</p>
<p>The reason why I picked VEN in particular is related to this article in
June. Ventana Gold raises \$20 million in private placement. Silver
Wheaton (SLW) paid \$20 million for shares priced at \$11.11 per share
back in June. SLW is a well managed company in the precious metal
industry. I've traded it before and it has always been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">on my radar to
buy</a>.</p>
<p>VEN has been taking a heavy beating in the past few weeks since SLW's
investment as shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Ventana Gold
Corp. (VEN.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-15-VEN.TO.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-15-VEN.TO.png">2</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>\$6.80 is the 50% retracement level to that recent rally (the first
since the dive beginning in June). It seems to be holding well today
despite market weakness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, EUR/USD rocketed upward and is trading around 1.29. This
isn't something to be ignored.</p>
<p>So I'm taking a small bet here at \$6.93. Stop loss order is opened at
\$6.40. My risk is thus, (\$6.93 - \$6.40) * 250 = \$132.50 + \$9.90
commission = \$142.40 = 1.5% of account.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market may be initiating a bear rally again according to the breath
indicator of Figure 1. We are seeing a positive divergence from the
upticking companies above 50-dma/200-dma ratio (solid line in main
graph) and the lower low on the TSX. Furthermore, TSX index price has
been holding a longer term support at 11000 despite a new recent low on
the number of companies above their respective 200 day moving average
(top indicator) . The CDNV to TSX ratio is also showing a similar
positive divergence.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Toronto
Composite (\$TSX)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-TSX.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Thus, I am taking a bullish step with a cautious long position in
Lululemon (LLL.TO). There's a strong uptrend in this one as shown in
Figure 2. \$37.50 looks like a long term support. However, my stop is
\$38-\$39 zone to be in sync with the market move. Also, the gap to
\$37.50 support has been closed previously already in May, so a second
re-test wouldn't bold well for LLL.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Lululemon
Athletica (LLL.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO.png" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO.png">1</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>In addition to the chart, LLL currently has an enormous 22.79% short
floats according to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/finviz/">Finviz</a>. It is 70.51% owned by the big money with
a 3.72% increase in holding in the last quarter. Short squeeze, anyone?</p>
<p>I took timed my entry based on intraday chart Figure 3. The top gap
today held for the first hour at least and then there were some
increased volume at the intraday support. I entered then.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="LLL.TO intraday
chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO-intra.gif" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-06-LLL.TO-intra.gif">2</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>However, LLL touched \$40 and is now retraced below \$39.50.</p>
<p>My mental stop is \$39.00 and my hard stop is \$38.50.</p>
<p>That is a risk of (\$38.50 - \$39.86) * 140 = \$190.40 + \$9.90
commission = \$200.30 = 2.13%.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>What I thought would be an intermediate term hold turns out to have
lasted mere minutes. I bought Teck Cominco (TCK.B.TO) after a small
bounce at \$34 support during lunch today. Figure 1 shows the clear
support level. Also note the fact that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-4-mfc-10oct-puts-17-00-1-43-mark-16-27-loss-0-5/">my recent shorts haven't been
working</a>, so I thought I would go with the flow and go long. [caption

immediately after my long entry (something I haven't done in a while).
TCK cracked the \$34 support swiftly to \$33.80, my mental support. My
alert was sounded and I kept an eye on it afterward. But then not long
after \$33.80, my hard stop at \$33.70 was filled and TCK traded down to
\$33.66 or so. It has now stabilized around \$33.80 as of 2pm. Figure 2
shows the intraday chart of TCK.B.TO. [caption id="" align="aligncenter"
width="570" caption="TCK.B.TO intraday chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-06-28-TCK.B.TO-intra.gif" />]<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-06-28-TCK.B.TO-intra.gif">1</a>[/caption] Loss
for this trade is (\$33.68 - \$34.10) * 250 = -\$105 - \$4.95 * 2
commission = -\$114.90 = -1.2% of account. My account is now
experiencing a 3.4% drawdown since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">the high on June 8th</a>. I can't
help but feel that this was a stop hunt. TCK is creeping higher at the
moment. However, as my initial position was stopped out, I am not going
to re-enter this trade just yet. Let's see what it does near the close
today. I am labelling this particular trade as a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/bad-trade/">bad trade</a> because
my stop was clearly too tight based on the time frame that I am
observing. I should have reduced my position size and widened my stop to
account for the recent volatility. Update: TCK gapped down 7% the day
after. At least my exit was timely.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market is under pressure as illustrated by EUR/USD weakness (Figure
1). I'm not sure which way it will go just yet. But I am placing my bet
on the bears as oil (DBO) has already cracked. I waited the whole week
for a retracement to re-enter a short position. I thought the FOMC
announcement today could produce some sort of short-term rally. But
nothing materialized. This lack of a retracement rally after a 30 points
drop in the S&amp;P500 between Monday and Tuesday is good for the bears.
Furthermore, seeing that EUR/USD is testing resistance again, I am
establishing an equity short with a financial company. In particular,
Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) is my victim as it appears to be the weakest
of them all (Figure 2).</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="EUR/USD hourly
chart"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-06-23-EURUSD.png" />][][/caption] I say that because despite the recent advance
in the market, MFC.TO is still struggling around the year-low (Figure
2).</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Manulife

<p>My mental stop is a close above \$16.50. A hard stop is \$1.00 on my
options premium.</p>
<p>That equates to (\$1.00 - \$1.48) * 100 * 4 = -\$192 - (\$13.95 x 2)
commission = \$219.90 = 2.3% of account.</p>
