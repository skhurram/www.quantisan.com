            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update: Cenovus offers <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/cenovus-defends-report-on-resources/article1543697/">an explanation of why it tanked</a> almost 5%
today (Apr 22). I doubled down on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">my short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO)
position</a> this morning. The price of CVE.TO moved in my favour a day
after my initial short entry. It then bounced back up strongly (about
2.5% rise in a day) yesterday to test \$29.50. However, it has backed
down since. The fact that it didn't touch the \$30 price level is a good
sign. Crude Oil (CL on NYMEX) made a similar move. It tested the 50%
Fibonacci resistance at 84.5 and backed down. This is again a good sign
for my short as it signals the downtrend is a go.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Cenovus Energy
Inc. (CVE.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-21-CVE-TO.png" />][][/caption] However, crude prices became very
choppy in the afternoon today as shown in Figure 2. So perhaps there is
still room to move up. I will keep an eye on the 84.50 and 85.50
resistances for crude and 29.50 and 30.00 for CVE.TO in the coming days.

this addition to my short position.</p>
<ol>
<li>this morning, the Bank of Canada gave strong hint that they will
    raise interest rate in June. However, USDCAD made a marginally new
    low briefly and then bounced back up above parity. This is bullish
    for USDCAD.</li>
<li>EnCana earnings topped estimates but the stock dived after the
    opening rush with at least 3 times morning volume as compared to the
    past five days. ECA.TO is hanging on to the 31.5 support level
    before noon but closed above it today. This is not a good sign for
    the energy sector on the TSX.</li>
</ol>
<p>A confirmation with this down move would be a break of the recent low at
\$28 for CVE.TO and \$82 for crude oil.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I made my first trade in my RRSP! It is a short on Cenovus Energy
(CVE.TO) via buying puts options. I chose the July expiry with the
intention to dispose of this position in May. Two reasons for that. 1)
Before time decay accelerates (about 60 days prior to expiry), and 2)
before the summer starts (low volatility in summer, premiums are
discounted). The following facts/opinions constituted my decision for
this entry.</p>
<ol>
<li>TSX index is toppy according to weekly RSI</li>
<li>TSX is losing steam this week versus the S&amp;P 500 (see Figure 1), but
    this is probably due to the forex market</li>
<li>MX Implied Volatility Index is testing 10.00 support again</li>
<li>Energy sector is weakest of all 3 prominent sectors on TSX (Energy,
    Financial, Material) in intermediate term</li>
<li>Oil is showing negative divergence on weekly chart</li>
<li>U.S. dollar index is in uptrend and testing support at 80</li>
<li>USD/CAD is testing major support at parity</li>
<li>CVE.TO looks weakest amongst top 5 traded Oil/Gas on TSX (for
    liquidity)</li>
<li>Negative divergence as seen on CVE.TO chart (Figure 2)</li>
<li>\$30 is a strong resistance level (Figure 2)</li>
<li>CVE.TO v. Crude Oil chart shows an intermediate term steady down
    trend</li>
</ol>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="512" caption="TSX Composite v.
S&amp;P 500"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-14-TSX-SPX.png" />][][/caption] Stop: \$32. Target: \$27. Commission paid
is \$12.95 on this trade (double that for a round trip). A rough
estimate of the premium by May expiry if CVE.TO is priced at \$32 then
would be \$0.80. Thus, I am risking about \$240 of my \$8,000 account in
this trade on a worst case scenario. Which is 3% of my RRSP account.
This is <em>significantly</em> more than my usual risk appetite (less than 0.2%
per trade in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex trading</a>). But any less would be pointless due to
the high relative commission for options. I had the choice of shorting
the market using options or leveraged bear ETF. The deteriorating value
of a bear ETF made it less favourable for holding for more than a few
days. So I traded options due to a lack of choices in my RRSP. Anyway,
that's my thought on this. Yet nothing matters but the price. Let's wait
and see how this goes. I plan to make one trade per quarter in my RRSP.
This one is for Q2.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I entered CADJPY long at market for 86.88 just now. This is a
continuation of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-usdcad-short-1-0540-for-131-pips/">previous USDCAD short</a> position. However, USDJPY
is on a run upward so I'm switching to go long on the loonie with yen
instead. Figure 1 shows the daily chart of CADJPY. Notice the imminent
MACD bullish crossover and the already in-play stochastic upturn. I like
it. My stop loss level is set at 86.10. It's the high of a previous peak
on February 3, two weeks ago. My target is the round number 88
resistance. 88.0 has been an important price level for CADJPY for the
past few months. So I'm setting my sight there.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="CADJPY,
daily"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-02-17-cadjpy_d.gif" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows my timing for this entry. CADJPY is noticeably meeting
some resistance at 87.50. 87.50 is also the 61.8% Fibonacci level of a
recent down move. This is a cause for concern on my long position as we
could very well retrace here. However, the bullishness of CADJPY is
apparent in Figure 2. Prices have consistently been bought for the past
few days right on the short term moving average (teal line).
Furthermore, the intermediate term moving average (orange line) is about
to cross the long term moving average (red line) as I enter this
position.</p>
<p>Lastly, gold price has taken a dive from 1130 to 1100. Meanwhile, crude
oil price is holding the 77 support nicely. Thus, this confirm my
previous view that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-change-of-wind-for-australian-dollar-shorted-audusd-0-9183-and-audcad-0-9546/">oil has better upside than gold</a> in the
intermediate term. Which is why I've been trading the loonie these past
weeks.</p>
<p>For this particular CADJPY trade, I have another buy order waiting above
current support level to add to my long position. Let's see if CADJPY
can break decisively to the upside in the next 24 hours as US and
Canadian data comes out.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Perhaps third times' the charm? I tried to short USDCAD twice last week
already. Both times I've been <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-out-of-usdcad-short-1-0640-for-67-pips-re-entering-1-0680/">stopped out</a> for a total of -0.2% of
account loss. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">intermediate term analysis</a> remains the same as
before. So I won't repeat myself here. Entry signal for this particular
short is shown in Figure 1. I'm just using the 4-hour chart as I have a
well defined (recent top) stop this time. I compensate with a smaller
position size to limit my risk to 0.1%. Reward / Risk = (1.05761 -
1.0671) / (1.0671 - 1.0756) = 1.11 [caption id="" align="aligncenter"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well this was awful. USDCAD continued on a rampage upward and I was
caught on the wrong side of the fence. Total loss for this was 0.12% of
my account. At least I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-usdcad-1-0573-stop-1-0640-target-1-0415/">was light in it</a>. In retrospect, I broke my
own rule and didn't enter at one of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">4 fundamental entry points</a>.
However, after some bear rampage throughout the markets today
(Bloomberg: [Stocks Plunge on Concern Rising Debt, Job Losses Threaten
Global Recovery][]), USDCAD is at the top of my channel as shown in
Figure 1 below. So while my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-fundamental-entry-signs-for-trading-and-why-they-are-not-that-important/">previous entry</a>
was early. USDCAD at this price is a good short. I will take it slow
this time by setting a limit order below current support on the 4-hour
at 1.0680, with a stop at 1.0750. And then adding a second chunk at
1.0640, my stopped out price. As is customarily lately, I am only
risking 0.1% of my account on the initial order. On a weekly chart,
1.0750 to 1.0810 is obviously a strong resistance for the USDCAD. It is
a congestion zone in 2007 and 2008. Then USDCAD spent the last quarter
of 2009 trying to break this resistance to no avail. But who knows,
perhaps USDCAD has had enough and it will break this resistance
decisively soon. That's why I'm only betting on this reversal with
limited risk. It's just a matter of wait and see now.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Taking a first position in USD/CAD short here at 1.0573 on a 4-hour
moving averages cross-over (Figure 1). I've also placed a limit order to
add more at 1.0519 below Fibonacci support (shown in Figure 1). Reason
for this trade is that USD/CAD is moving away from an upper bound
channel with a overbought stochastic reading, as shown in the daily
chart of Figure 2. I've also considered going long AUD/USD, but AUD/CAD
trend remains bearish. So I chose to short USD/CAD instead. Secondly,
crude oil (and gold too) looks to be bouncing off an oversold level with
a rapid move in 2 days from 72.43 to 77.39. Coincidentally, INO.com
posted an intermediate term <a href="http://www.ino.com/info/513/CD4184/&amp;dp=0&amp;l=0&amp;campaignid=3">cyclical analysis video with a bullish
outlook</a> (affiliate link). They put out a better case than I do.
USD/CAD might make a short-term upward bounce here because of a
short-term oversold condition. However, there's evidently a lack of
buyers in the past few hours (Fig. 1). The price has been sitting on
support a bit too long in my view. Thus, I'm expecting it to break
without a meaningful retracement (hence the short entry). A confirmation
would be a break below 1.0530. Thus I have a limit order to short more
below that price. I am risking 0.1% of my account on this trade. As you
may have noticed, these charts are from Metatrader. I'm switching over
to the MT4 platform as of today. Having played with its charting
features for the past few hours, I'm quite satisfied with it so far.
Although my needs are low as I was fine with the Oanda platform too
(arguably the most simplistic platform out there). [caption id=""
