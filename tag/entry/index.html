            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've had more time to study the market tonight and is running a second
and a third instances of Quantised Trading Desk (QTD) to trade 3
currencies in total simultaneously. For my dollar bull sentiment, I'm
dividing between USDJPY long and NZDUSD short. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bullish-usdjpy-on-week-of-april-17-2011/">QTD still hasn't taken a
position in USDJPY in the past 24 hours</a>. That's a good thing as
USDJPY is still drifting downward today even as the dollar is gaining
some ground. My line in the sand is at 80.70 for USDJPY and above 0.8100
for NZDUSD. EURGBP long is a hedge against my dollar longs. Again, I'm
not making any trade at this point but merely <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/quantised-trading-desk/">setting up QTD to wait
for the right moments to enter</a>. A break below 0.8660 for EURGBP would
challenge my bullish bias. These three currencies should be my complete
market bias for a while. I'm just going to let QTD do its thing and
trade for me. Hopefully this will be the last you'll hear from me about
my market bias for a while. [caption id="attachment_5342"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have unofficially launched my Quantised Trading Desk (QTD) expert
system this weekend as the system is ready for live trading after almost
a year in development. You can't miss the announcement if you visit the
new frontpage of this blog. So, I won't talk about it anymore here. The
purpose of this post is to discuss my forex trade. It's been over 7
months since I've traded on the forex market. I have been working on QTD
during all these months to improve my overall trading. Anyway, let's
dive right to it for my first trade back into forex. I am bullish on the
U.S. dollar this week. Why? The Financial Times is letting on <a href="">rumours
that the US Fed is signalling an end to quantitative easing</a>.
Coincidentally, the U.S. dollar appears to be testing supports across
all major currencies. Secondly the US equities market hasn't been able
to make higher highs even as the dollar is marking new lows. Still, I'm
not one to call a bottom, nor am I hunting for one. This is merely a
good risk-reward trade to gun for an obvious move. In particular, USDJPY
appears to be the best of the bunch as its been holding well over the
past few months while the dollar crumbled. The fact that Europe and US
are rumoured to be lighting up on the money printing whereas Japan's
money printing press is on full steam for the quake reconstruction (Yen
bearish) is a decent excuse to place some chips on USDJPY. You might
have noticed, I haven't specified my entry price, amount, or stop loss
price as usual. This is because I am relying on the Quantised Trading
Desk expert system to trade USDJPY for me. QTD will monitor the market
for me and execute trade entries and exits as it sees fit to accumulate
a long position in USDJPY. All the risk management and quant analysis
are built into the system. So I don't have a position yet because I'm
waiting for QTD to do the grunt work. [caption id="attachment_5332"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p><strong>Update January 26:</strong> The share price of PMV.V crossed my mental stop
yesterday so I had to reassess the position. I sold my shares at \$0.56
for a loss of (\$0.56 - \$0.62) * 1000 = \$70 + \$19.90 commission =
\$89.90 = 0.9% of account. Gold is falling while USD tanked this week.
The lack of volume on today's goldminers rally is also uncharacteristic
of the recent uptrend. The long term uptrend of gold and gold miners is
unmistakable on both fundamental and technical basis. I am taking a
dabble in this junior gold miner as its share price is making a gap fill
on a recent breakout (Fig. 1), amongst other things. Intraday chart
(Fig. 2) is also showing signs of life at this support level. What's
going to happen to gold as it breaks below 1350 (first time since
November) from worries about Chinese inflation, which led to strength in
USD (on fear of further Chinese tightening) as EURUSD dropped 60 pips in
2 hours. See FT: <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ab89d906-244e-11e0-a89a-00144feab49a.html">Fears grow that China is overheating</a>. Couple that
with political and economic uncertainty, we have a short term
uncertainty in gold's direction. However, all these is in line with the
underlying gold-bug case that money is becoming more worthless as
governments pump in money to their respective economies. Another point
to note is that as the Shanghai Composite and Bombay Stock Exchange
(i.e. growth markets) are making 3-month lows in recent weeks, people
will start to look for other assets to diversify their wealth. This is
all conjectures anyway. I can't predict the future.I am merely placing
my bet as the stars seem to have aligned for me to increase the
probability of this good reward/risk trade. Mental stop is \$0.55. Hard
stop is \$0.48, however, I'll give it some margin and say 0.40 is my
stop as liquidity is thin in this junior. Thus, risk is (\$0.62 -
\$0.40) * 1000 = \$220 + \$9.95 commission = \$229.95 = 2.4% of
account. Note: You might have noticed that my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">trade log</a> style has
changed for 2011. I am trying to jot down my thought process rather than
the data analysis and numerical logic to better capture my <em>thinking</em>
for the record.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Market is tanking (Figure 1). Lots of pessimism in the news. Time for me
to load on some growth stocks. I'm passing the goldminers in this move
as the dollar seem to be rising from the dead and gold may be
consolidating.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TSX, 12500 looks
like a fine support, doesn't it?"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-11-16-TSX.png" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Instead, I'm picking a growth stock, Lululemon (LLL.TO). Lululemon is
holding well in this down move. Furthermore, the intraday test of
support at 46.50 looks promising as there were few sellers at that price
level. The recent break above long-term resistance at 48 is good too. So
is the 19.6% short float... Anyway, you get the picture.</p>

of account. I'm giving <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-300-hod-to-9-12-loss-0-6/">this short oil play another try</a>. See the
topping COT (<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm">CFTC: Commitments of Traders</a>) lagging open interest
data (bottom of Fig. 1). I waited for a breakdown in the hourly chart
(Fig. 2) to make my entry into this short. The market has been coiling
up for the entire month of October. Something big is about to happen
sooner or later. Perhaps the U.S. midterm election tomorrow can finally
move this market? Stop is at 8.80. Risk is (\$9.03 - \$8.80) * 250 =
\$57.50 + \$9.90 commission = \$67.40 = 0.68% of account. Position size
is still small with this lack of market volume.</p>
