            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I placed this EUR/JPY long order a couple of days ago. It just got
triggered overnight in the Pacific market hours. See Figure 1 for my
entry chart. Note the following reasons for long EUR/JPY:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support trendline coincide with round number 130.00</li>
<li>RSI in oversold territory and moved up</li>
<li>EUR/JPY in a trading range with the MA's oscillating since April</li>
</ol>
<p>EUR/JPY was testing 131.00 when I placed this order and I didn't think
it would get triggered. I placed a full 100% position in this but 1/2 of
my position has a trailing stop of 50 pips and it got run down within a
few hours of entry. That 1/2 was out at 129.666 for a loss of 3.33 pips.
I'm only left with a 1/2 position in this at the moment. In hindsight,
that trailing stop was too close as the 3-hour ATR is 25-30 pips. Entry:
129.99, round number support Stop: 128.80, see Figure 2, just below
recent low and support line Target: 134.00, see Figures 1 and 2. At the
bottom range of a congestion zone. Reward / Risk = 401 / 119 = 3.4 > 3.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>In addition to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdchf-50-long-1-02747-trailing-stop-1-0236/">my USD/CHF long</a>, I also placed this NZD/USD short
order last night. Having failed to short this earlier on a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-nzdusd-short-stop-entry-0-7262-exit-trailing-stop-0-7300/">resistance
test of 0.7300</a> using the 4 hour time frame, I'm testing out my daily
method now for shorting at resistance at 0.7380. 0.7380 is an important
resistance for NZD/USD because it marks the breaking point back in July
2008 when NZD/USD started a 6-month long downtrend. Although 0.7500 is
definitely a much stronger and more obvious resistance level, it is a
bit too obvious to wait to shorting it then. I would not short at 0.75
just because it's too obvious to be run down. Furthermore, NZD/USD has
been chugging upward relentlessly. It is deep in overbought territory as
shown by the RSI of Figure 1. Thus, I'm feeling confident enough in this
trade to enter with a full 100% position. Entry: 0.73701 Stop:
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">0.7500</span>, 0.7480
Target: 0.7000 Reward / Risk = 370.1 / 129.9 = 2.8 \&lt; 3. So I'm moving
my stop closer, right at the resistance from the starting point of the
long term drop which started in July 2008. Reward / Risk = 370.1 / 109.9
= 3.4 NZD/USD took a quick dive of about 70 pips within hours of my
entry. So I moved 1/2 of my stop to break-even (net +\$1.81). That tight
stop was taken this evening at the open of the Pacific market, see
Figure 2. I'm left with only a 1/2 position now. Once again, I'm a bit
too hasten to move up my stop. Time will tell if that was a good
decision.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've switched back to using the daily chart as <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/not-to-lose-focus-by-defining-what-i-want-from-trading/">noted earlier today</a>
to save myself some hassle. This is the first entry using the daily
chart since the switch. But I actually placed this order before going to
bed and then it was executed last night while I was sleeping. USD is
taking a beating these days and USD/CHF is testing a double bottom. I
entered this trade based on Figure 1 for the following 4 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>RSI is shaping up a positive divergence if we can hold this support.</li>
<li>RSI is as oversold as December 2008.</li>
<li>Entry price of 1.027 is at a previous congestion zone based on
    Figure 2.</li>
<li>USD/CHF took a very fast dive in the past 3 days, which usually
    prelude a retracement up.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the trend remains obviously downward. That's why I'm entering
with only a 50% as there's no confirmation just yet. Once there's
confirmation, such as the RSI making a U bottom, I plan to add the other
50% position. Entry: 1.02747, previous congestion zone, see Fig. 2 Stop:
1.0236 Target: 1.045 Reward / Risk = 175.3 / 38.7 = 4.5 > 3</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My long USD/CHF got stopped out just minutes ago.  The support at 1.0300
has broken.  The intermediate and short term trends are both down.  So I
have entered a short trade for USD/CHF with 1/2 position to see how it
goes.</p>
<p>I initially had set the stop at 1.0340 for this trade.  But the support
at 1.0270 looks hard to break on first try.  So I readjusted my target
and stop to aim for an exit at 1.0270.  In fact, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve
placed an order to reverse and go long at 1.027 with a full position.</p>
<p>Entry: 1.0296, just below round number.</p>
<p>Stop: 1.0340, trailing, set at the previous congestion zone.</p>
<p>Target: 1.0270, previous support level.</p>
<p>Reward / Risk = 26 / 19 = 1.4 \&lt; 3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ this is horrible.  So
I just closed my trade at a slight loss at 1.03013 for -\$1.56.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My NZD/USD short at 0.72509 just before noon today got stopped out an
hour later at 0.72661. At least it was only a 1/2 position. I wanted to
short again when NZD/USD broke 0.7280 because of the resistance as shown
in Figure 1. However, remembering #1 in my newly updated <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">3 trading
rules</a>, I re-considered and held back. NZD/USD is testing 0.7300 at
this moment, so this rule is proving itself useful already. What's
interesting now is that as NZD/USD is testing 0.7300, both USD/CAD and
USD/CHF are well off the support levels of 1.0700 and 1.0300,
respectively. There's no particular reason for using these two pairs,
they are just two pairs that I've been following. Which seems to me that
the weakness is USD isn't as bad as it would seem. If it is, then US
dollar would be under pressure in all fronts. And it's not now. At least
not yet. Thus, not giving up on this nice setup as shown in Figure 1,
I've placed a short stop entry for 50% position just below the next
intraday support at 0.7262. Just to catch it on its way down from this
very obvious resistance level. In any case, here're my 5 reasons for
shorting based on Figure 1.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend is neutral</li>
<li>We're at the top of a trading range</li>
<li>Near resistance at long term Fib level and round number at 0.7300</li>
<li>Potential double top, although this is very uncertain</li>
<li>Little breathing room in recent climb up</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, here is my order: Size: Half position, 3000 units Side:
Short Stop entry: 0.7262 Stop exit: 0.7300, set to trail Target: 0.7132,
top of that uptrending line in Figure 1 Reward / Risk = 130 / 38 = 3.42
> 3 I'm pondering should I enter 50% position when NZD/USD is hanging
around 07290. But I think I'll hold it off since my USD/CHF is still
open. Update: My short entry was triggered for 0.72509 (horrible
spread). I was stopped out at 0.72661 an hour later for a net loss of
\$4.57. This was not a good trade because NZD/USD was so close to a
round number resistance that it was probable to test it.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I figured I should write this sooner before the market moves more and
skew my thoughts on this entry. After my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdchf-out-at-1-03998-50-pips-and-1-03798-30-pips/">earlier entry in USD/CHF were
stopped</a> out this morning, I tried to enter once, got stopped out; and
then an even better setup appeared, so I entered again. See Figure 1.
This is a really awesome setup for the following 5 reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend is on our side as it's still pointing up.</li>
<li>Identical setup to last week's dive before the climb, same RSI, same
    candlestick</li>
<li>Bounced right at 1.031, which is at a longer term Fibonacci fan line
    as shown in Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Another support at round number 1.030, which is very near.</li>
<li>Good reward/risk ratio, see below for calculation.</li>
</ol>
<p>I entered 6000 units (2/3 position as usual) and placed the stop at
1.0300, just 20 pips away. USD/CHF climbed up to 1.0345 almost
immediately after my entry. So I moved my first stop to 1.0310
(Fibonacci level) for half my position. That got taken out minutes later
and it marked the bottom (for now) at 1.0309. I was a bit too hasten to
move my stop up for this part. See Figure 2 for my orders. One big
caveat to this entry is my tight stop at 1.0300. It is simply too
obvious of a stop price. I'd imagine the market would try to gun the
stops there before a run-up. However, if 1.030 breaks, it would ruin the
setup as described above. And if they're able to break that level, who
knows how far this can go further down. So I'm keeping my stop as is.
Anyway, I still have half of my initial position left. USD/CHF is
trading around 1.034. I don't think I'll do anything to this position
for now. I'm comfortable with just half position sitting in for the
weekend. Entry: 1.0320, Fib fan line support, see Fig 1. Stop 1: 1.031,
triggered already for a loss of 10 pips. Stop 2: 1.030, round number
support. Target: 1.038 - 1.040, starting point of this quick dive.
Reward/Risk = 60 / 20 = 3, right on the line of my goal. Although I am
secretly eyeing the 1.045 level as a target, I'll be cautious starting
from 1.038. Probably by setting a trailing stop if we do touch that. As
always, let's wait and see how this goes.</p>
