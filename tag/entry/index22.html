<p>After breaking the 820 support on the S&amp;P 500 2 days ago, the market
dived into the abyss today as I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-breakdown-of-a-major-multi-year-support-are-we-going-down-and-i-mean-really-down/">suggested this morning</a>. Frankly, the
mid-day looked alright and I thought we wouldn't go down anymore.</p>
<p>Turns out I was wrong (I stayed on sideline as planned). The market
capitulated in the last hour. In particular, Citigroup sank to \$4.71.
My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-325/">short call at \$8.20</a> would have made a killing had I not get
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-350/">stopped out</a>. Oh well, I'm not complaining. Although my portfolio is
way down, I am just glad that I managed my risk and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-195/">covered all my
short puts</a> a couple of days ago. In hindsight though, I really should
have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-325/">hedged my position</a> more eagerly.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to this entry. Why? After failing to pick the bottom so
many times, why the heck am I entering now? (This is going in my rule
book, <strong>no picking top/bottom</strong>)</p>
<p>Do I think this is the bottom for FSLR? I don't know. Why did I enter
this trade? Because if offers good risk/reward and probability.</p>
<p>Upside: January 2009 expiry date with 50% probability of expiry for this
70 strike. Support is \$75 for FSLR set in 2007 but we never even came
close to it in this historic downleg in the market. Today marked a new
low of \$86. Thus, my 70 strike is a stink bid. And being paid \$13.20
for this stink bid? I compared this risk/reward to a few strong
companies I liked and this OTM put price is the highest (since I'm
shorting).</p>
<p>Resistance: \$100. But I don't really care since this is a stink bid and
I have limited upside.</p>
<p>Downside: If we do break \$75, then all hell breaks lose in this. We are
still in a severe and monumental market crash. I don't have cash to buy
the shares if this is put to me in January.</p>
<p>Support: \$75.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is a high probability trade. Stop is just below \$75.</p>
<p>
**Update:** I am going to liquidate this position tomorrow. Bill from
[BillCara.com kindly shared his insight][] on this trade.

I also didn't think this thoroughly myself. I simply cannot stomach the
potential drawdown in FSLR. Even my own trendline analysis shows it can
go to \$80 on this down run. I should wait for confirmations of strength
before heading in at this point.

<p>Going long haven't been working out for me. So I'm going to stick in a
short side trade to hedge my long positions. I chose Citibank because
it's the obvious. It's a financial, and it just reported a massive 20%
cut to its workforce. While that's good news in the long run and I
typically go against the media, that strategy haven't worked well.
That's why I'm going for the blatantly obvious this time around.</p>
<p>The TICK just marked a new high for the day but we're merely testing a
local resistance. The downside seems more and more possible now. That's
why I want to hedge my longs at this point.</p>
<p>Upside: Quadriple bottom forming. The company is accepting reality and
putting in efforts to minimize future downside.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$9.5</p>
<p>Downside: We are spiralling down. Continued market weakness seen in
intraday data, Figure 2.</p>
<p>Support: \$8</p>
<p>Bottom line: This trade is opposite of my usual strategy. Going short at
a major support level is very risky. Yet, doing what i normally do
hasn't worked for the past two weeks. So I'm just going to go with the
flow and try a short side position to hedge my positions. As this is a
Nov call, this is a short term trade with a stop of C share price
\$8.40.</p>

<p>Just a plethora of horrible news for TCK lately. Last week on 11/11,
<a href="http://www.financialpost.com/trading_desk/mining/story.html?id=950874">Financial Post published an article</a> about it. TCK gapped down on
11/12. Even the Motley Fool has an article titled "What the Heck, Teck?"</p>
<p>TCK share price seem to be settling in \$5 - \$6. So why the heck am I
long now? Ignoring the hypes, the fundamentals of TCK still stand. See
the Motley Fool article. It has \$2.7 cash/share and 0.17 debt/equity
ratio. Granted, it took on \$9.8 billion of debt recently, about <em>4
times its current market cap.</em>!</p>
<p>The technicals though, are looking good. On the daily chart, the VW-MACD
is showing a positive divergence. The CO has reached an unprecedented
low and is just heading back up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the commodities are showing signs of a positive divergence
too.</p>
<p>Upside: In addition to the above, Max Pain is at \$30 (\$10 for CBOE
data) for November! Yes, \$30!</p>
<p>Resistance: \$6</p>
<p>Downside: Same reasons why TCK has dropped from \$30 to \$5. Possibility
of defaulting on massive loan.</p>
<p>Support: \$5</p>
<p>Bottom line: Max pain at \$30 when we're just below \$6! TCK is a
diversified miner, a value <em>producing</em> company. TCK and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/abb/">ABB</a> are now
my top choices in this struggling economy.</p>

<p>Another busy day today. I usually write up my entry/exit posts
immediately for my trades, but I needed to keep my eyes on the market
due to the fact that I went all in today.</p>
<p>I'm really tired after a long day and the fact that I went swimming
right after the close. So I'll cut myself some slack and refer you to my
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-recollection-of-my-analysis-for-buying-when-sp-broke-down-to-820-today/">market analysis post from today</a> instead. Long story short, I entered
long because of the low volume retest of major support. I held because
the price and volume showed strength in testing the resistance
throughout the day.</p>
<p>I am heavy on ABB because S&amp;P broke down to 820 and ABB is still above
the Oct low of \$10. It has held on triumphantly in this leg of market
selloff. Refer to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-170/">ABB entry yesterday for a more detailed analysis
of the company</a>.</p>
<p>I added to SLW because the commodities are showing some strength too. I
have been a fan of SLW for a while, take a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">look at those posts for my
opinions of SLW</a>.</p>
<p>My plan now will be as usual, I will unload into strength starting with
my weakess position and work my way up.</p>
<p>There're a lot I want to write down, but my mind is blank now. So I'll
leave this as is.</p>

<p>Three reasons why I'm fundamentally bullish on ABB.</p>
<ol>
<li>\$8.6 billion in cash and \$2 billion in debt (0.2 debt/equity
    ratio)</li>
<li>It is making use of this cash and current market panic to expand its
    operation. See: Cash-Rich ABB Speeds Up Buys As Markets Weaken. It's
    one of the few companies not afraid to act at this time!</li>
<li>ABB makes power control and distribution systems. It's one of the
    largest builder of power grids. All these talk of alternative
    energy, reduce oil use, hybrid/all-electric cars, etc. have one
    thing in common -- electricity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upside: Good fundamental, active management to make use of current
condition. Significant volume around \$10 last month.</p>
<p></p>
Resistance: Recent top of \$14.</p>
<p>Downside: We seem to be in correction of 10/28 day, moving to low of
about \$10.</p>
<p>Support: \$10</p>
<p>Bottom line: Risk/reward ratio of about 3 to 1. Not that great. But I
can afford to have the shares put to me if this doesn't expire next
week. Not saying I would sit still if it does collapse, but at least I'm
not biting more than I can handle.</p>
<p>On another note, I entered because the market seem to be stronger today.
Notice the Advance Decline line staying around neutral and the TICK not
really down that much.</p>

<p>Update: An hour later and we've broken down. ABB is at \$10.39 and S&amp;P
at 868. I guess I should have waited til the afternoon.</p>
