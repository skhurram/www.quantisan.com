            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Arguably the single most important skill a trader needs to master in
trading any market is to <strong>cut your losses short and let your profits
run</strong>. This is simply another saying of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">managing risks</a> and
maximizing opportunities. However, this is easier said than done. Ever
tried to cut your losses short but only to see the price run in your
favour soon afterward? Or, that you've built a sizable and profitable
position only to see it turn into a loss? As with much of other trading
skills, managing your trade is not an exact science. That is why you
need to have probabilities in your favour on every step. You enter a
trade because it is <em>likely</em> to be profitable. You exit a trade when it
is not. If you can apply this axiom on every trade you do, it is
<em>likely</em> that you will be profitable, with all things being equal. So
what does this have to do with cut your losses short and let your
profits run? In this post, I will discuss one <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy</a> which
I use to do exactly that. The key to this strategy is divide and
conquer. Instead of taking one trade for each position, consider taking
multiple smaller trades by scaling in and out of a position. That way,
you can have more freedom in your trade by using your position size to
your advantage. Here's the gist of the strategy and the rationale for
it. The rule is simple: increase a position by scaling in as the
probability of success increases; and decrease a position by scaling out
as the probability of success decreases. One way to do this is to add on
a position as the price breaks support on a faster timeframe. You keep
adding on this position as long as your trade setup (on a higher time
frame) is valid. At the same time, you limit your risk by <em>lowering the
stop</em> of your previous trade to breakeven. That way, even though you are
stockpiling a position, the overall risk stays the same. This is an
essential step in the technique. Otherwise the risk would just multiply.
It is as much managing the entries as well as the stops/exits. Let's put
this into perspective with a real-world example. Figure 1 shows the
support levels for my EUR/CHF short on a 3-hour chart. I identified this
trade using my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC setup</a> on the daily chart. The failed break above
1.4800 on January 14 was the signal for entry. I took an initial short
position risking 0.20% of my account as EUR/CHF reverted back below
1.4800 (first support, not marked). Then I kept adding on to this
position below 1.4787, 1.4761, and 1.4742 supports as shown in Fig. 1
with the horizontal dashed red lines. On each subsequent new entry, I
move the stop on the previous entry to b/e. I only risk 0.1% on each of
these additions with half the position size after the initial entry. As
I keep adding, I keep moving the stops one step behind. So on my third
scale-in, my initial stop have locked in some profits at a price level
between my first and second entries. Figure 2 is the same chart but with
the actual filled orders (yellow triangles) and current stops (red
lines) marked. As you can see, I have effectively accumulated a sizable
position size in this short while limiting my risk to just a fraction
(0.2% versus 1.0%) if I were to enter my maximum size all at once.
Furthermore, my confidence and probability of this trade increase
gradually as I see the short-term support levels break one after
another. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="EURCHF,
3-hour, showing supports"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-01-18-EURCHF_3h.PNG" />][][/caption] [caption id=""

First of all, this strategy is mostly suitable for trading setups with
an expected high reward/risk ratio. You might not want to use this for a
range trading strategy as there's probably not enough price move to
break the trade into steps. Secondly, this technique is mostly for an
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated system</a> or longer term manual strategies (hours or more).
Just so you have sufficient time to manage all these extra work without
adding on an unnecessary amount of stress. Lastly, an obvious downside
to this approach is that your account will take a hit from the spreads
and commissions for each move. So do take those costs into account in
building your own adaptation to this concept. Now that I've discussed my
scaling-in technique, what do you think? <strong>Update January 22:</strong> I've
closed this position and it turns out to be <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/closed-eurchf-and-gbpchf-shorts-best-trade-ever/">one of my best trade
ever</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>CAD/JPY failed a major resistance level at 90 and has edged out an
obvious intermediate-term downtrend (Fig 1). USD/CAD is also bouncing
off a major support at 1.0200 (Fig. 2). And crude oil is below \$80 on a
slippery slope. As such, shorting loonie seems like a good move at the
moment according to my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC trading setup</a>. Yet, here is why I am
opting to short CAD/JPY and not long the more popular USD/CAD currency
pair. Figure 3 shows a 5-year, weekly chart of CAD/JPY (top) and USD/CAD
(bottom). Evidently, the exchange rate of CAD/JPY is still in a
depressed mode since the fall of September 2008. It's also clear on this
chart that why I say 90 is a major resistance level. Beside from being a
nice round number, CAD/JPY has failed to break above 90 twice since
August 2009. As for USD/CAD, the picture isn't as clear. 1.0200 is
definitely a very strong support because it marks the top of a 6-month
range in the first half of 2008. Yet, the downward slope in the long
term since 2005 is not to be ignored. As such, I do not dare to bet on a
bounce on this pair at this price. Moreover, the intermediate-term move
on both of these pair is giving us a confirmation. CAD/JPY is now
testing a falling trendling (Fig. 1). Whereas USD/CAD is testing a
falling support. Thus, I am shorting CAD/JPY under pressure. Going long
on USD/CAD now would be like betting it to bounce on a slippery slope.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Gold price made a 15 point jump over the weekend to 1160 and is
consolidating now (Fig. 1). Crude oil tested 84 and is back down to just
above 83 now. Yet, AUDCAD is still struggling to break above 9600 (Fig.
2). You would have thought that AUDCAD should mustered enough momentum
to break above this key resistance with all these gold bullishness and
oil bearishness. Thus, I am giving this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audcad-0-9489-stop-9540/">AUDCAD short setup as described
previously</a> another try. I am only risking 0.16% on this trade. It is
half of my usual initial entry. First because it is a FTR (reversal)
setup and second because I am in a 3% drawdown. So my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk
manaegment</a> rules dictate that I trade halved size. This setup is
according to the monthly and weekly chart, so it could take a while, and
probably more tries, before it shows its hands. I will keep shorting it
as long as it's below 9600 on the weekly. Limited by the amount at risk
according to my risk management rules, of course!</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[This post was updated on January 13, see addendum below.] I have
discussed my enthusiasm in shorting the Aussie a few times this week.
First trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">shorting AUD/JPY at 84.53</a>. After that got stopped
out, I re-tried at the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-retrying-audjpy-short-84-52-stop-85/">same level the next day</a>. My trade history in
this currency pair is shown in Figure 1 below. Evidently, I am early in
my trades as the recent upward momentum is still going. But that's just
speaking from hindsight advantage. What is actually wrong with this play
is that I was too eager at the first entry when the price was just at a
minor resistance (short-term trendline of Fig 1). In turn, that caused
me to lose my confidence and not be as aggressive as I should be when
the price reached a major resistance at 85.50. Referring to Fig. 1, I
made 5 attempts on the minor resistance below 84.60 in the first round.
What's worse is that I didn't have enough patience to wait after these
shorts failed and I tried again at 84.52. Even though that resistance
level is voided already. But here comes the kicker. I actually <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-84-53-stop-85-00/">noted
the important 85.50 level before my first attempt</a>. It was clearly on the chart and I even mentioned about its
significance. I just figured that it wouldn't be touched. How wrong I
was. As I said, another problem with being early in a trade is that it
stripe you of your confidence prematurely in a good setup. My setup to
short AUD/JPY is as good as ever now. I am drooling over that negative
RSI divergence shown in Fig. 1... But since I've already taken a beating
in this pair this week, my account drawdown dictates that I limit my
risk. As such, I can't back up the truck to pile in on this trade at
this point. But why not? I won't break one rule to compensate for
another. Although I am light in this trade now, I will not compromise my
risk management rules to compensate for my own mistakes. That would just
open a whole new can of worm. Besides, I can't say this often enough --
risk management is always the top priority in trading. In any case,
there will always be other opportunities. The moral of the story is
this. Do not be too eager to get into a trade. Secondly, adjust your
position size accordingly to the significance of the setup in play.</p>

an updated view of AUD/JPY a week later. The red dot on the 9th was my
last stopped out entry. As you can see, I missed the smooth 200 pips
ride down. This experience is proving to be better than I expected to
illustrate how being early in a trade can really hurt your account.</p>
