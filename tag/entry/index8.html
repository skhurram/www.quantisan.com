            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update May 10: Looks like I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-illustration-of-what-it-means-by-missing-the-boat-in-trading/">missed the boat</a>. TCK.B gapped up almost
7% at the Monday open to \$38.88. I won't be chasing the market at this
point as the reward/risk ratio isn't appealing anymore. Update: I got
stopped out at breakeven (after commission) before I can post this piece
at the end of the day. I'm back to all cash going into the weekend. I am
taking a dip in Teck Resources (TCK/B.TO) with 110 shares bought at
\$36.03. This is a trade to "buy when everyone else is in fear".
Following my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-hell-and-back-a-review-of-tsx-after-a-v-day/">assessment of the market yesterday</a>, I don't think
things are that bad, yet. So I am establishing a small position in a
strong company today. TCK is trading on its 200 day moving average at
\$35 this week (Figure 1). Yesterday's epic dive and recovery didn't
break this \$35 support. So that's a very good sign for TCK.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Tech Resources
(TCK-B.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO.png" />][][/caption] Furthermore, \$35 is an obvious
psychological round number support. It is also above the recent low of
\$32.50 printed in February of this year as shown in Figure 1. The
oscillator value (top of Figure 1) is making a positive divergence as
TCK is testing this support level). I entered today based on the 5-day
intraday chart. This morning's opening hour test of \$35 support has
lower volume than earlier this week (Figure 2). As such, I think \$35
can hold. So I entered when the price shot above minor resistance at
\$36.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TCK-B.TO

drifted back under \$35.50 after I entered but then reversed and tested
\$37. I moved my stop loss to breakeven as it touched an equidistance
price opposite of my stop. Just so I don't see profits turn into losses.
If I get stopped out today, I will not re-enter until after the weekend.
My target is \$40 and original stop was \$35 for about a 4 to 1 reward
to risk ratio. I am risking 1.25% in this trade with a position size of
110 shares.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO) tested 27.50 support and then bounced back to
break the short-term downtrend line above 28.50 or so, see Figure 1.
Naturally, I don't want to turn a profitable trade into a losing one. So
I wanted to sell <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-10jul17-puts-30-00-mx-2-45-mark-28-64/">my puts options on CVE.TO</a> while I can still exit at
near breakeven. However, as I am new to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade</a> and unfamiliar
with their interface, I made the careless mistake of buying six more
contracts instead of selling the six that I have!</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Cenovus Energy
(CVE.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-23-CVE-TO.png" />][][/caption] I realized my mistake soon afterward from
checking my account. Imagine my surprise to find that I am an owner of
12 puts contracts on CVE.TO. So I wanted to cut my losses immediately.
Unfortunately, the energy sector (XLF) and crude oil just broke above
some key resistances and CVE.TO bumped up a few more points. The right
thing to do is to ignore my unfortunate losses and just exit the
position, as that was what I intended to do. But I didn't. I decided to
not panic and analyze the stock yet another time. CVE.TO is definitely
weak. It is lagging behind others in the sector. Other energy companies
are breaking above resistance levels but CVE.TO is still below its 29.50
resistance. Yet, the fact is that the trend in the sector is upward.
Which is very bad for me. I am still holding this short CVE.TO position
over the weekend as it hasn't broken my 29.50 mental stop yet. I can
give my bearish reasons here upon observing the tape this afternoon
(e.g. Goldman Sachs Canada is dumping shares), but they would just be
excuses under the current circumstances. In any case, this is an
embarrassing confession as I've violated one of the most <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">basic rules of
trading</a>. This position is near breakeven on paper as of the close.
But who knows what can happen over the weekend. Rather than risking 3%,
which is already too much, I am now risking a <em>maximum</em> of 10% on this
trade. What have I done... The high commission in trading options is
affecting my decision. If this were a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex</a> position, I would have
dumped it all without giving it a second thought. This is a sign for me
to stop trading options altogether. It is better to stay with a
long-only equity strategy in my RRSP than get eaten up by commissions or
take excessive risks as I am doing now.</p>

today (Apr 22). I doubled down on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-3-cve-to-jul-30-puts-1-75-mark-30-10/">my short Cenovus Energy (CVE.TO)
position</a> this morning. The price of CVE.TO moved in my favour a day
after my initial short entry. It then bounced back up strongly (about
2.5% rise in a day) yesterday to test \$29.50. However, it has backed
down since. The fact that it didn't touch the \$30 price level is a good
sign. Crude Oil (CL on NYMEX) made a similar move. It tested the 50%
Fibonacci resistance at 84.5 and backed down. This is again a good sign
for my short as it signals the downtrend is a go.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Cenovus Energy
Inc. (CVE.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-21-CVE-TO.png" />][][/caption] However, crude prices became very
choppy in the afternoon today as shown in Figure 2. So perhaps there is
still room to move up. I will keep an eye on the 84.50 and 85.50
resistances for crude and 29.50 and 30.00 for CVE.TO in the coming days.

this addition to my short position.</p>
<ol>
<li>this morning, the Bank of Canada gave strong hint that they will
    raise interest rate in June. However, USDCAD made a marginally new
    low briefly and then bounced back up above parity. This is bullish
    for USDCAD.</li>
<li>EnCana earnings topped estimates but the stock dived after the
    opening rush with at least 3 times morning volume as compared to the
    past five days. ECA.TO is hanging on to the 31.5 support level
    before noon but closed above it today. This is not a good sign for
    the energy sector on the TSX.</li>
</ol>
<p>A confirmation with this down move would be a break of the recent low at
\$28 for CVE.TO and \$82 for crude oil.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I made my first trade in my RRSP! It is a short on Cenovus Energy
(CVE.TO) via buying puts options. I chose the July expiry with the
intention to dispose of this position in May. Two reasons for that. 1)
Before time decay accelerates (about 60 days prior to expiry), and 2)
before the summer starts (low volatility in summer, premiums are
discounted). The following facts/opinions constituted my decision for
this entry.</p>
<ol>
<li>TSX index is toppy according to weekly RSI</li>
<li>TSX is losing steam this week versus the S&amp;P 500 (see Figure 1), but
    this is probably due to the forex market</li>
<li>MX Implied Volatility Index is testing 10.00 support again</li>
<li>Energy sector is weakest of all 3 prominent sectors on TSX (Energy,
    Financial, Material) in intermediate term</li>
<li>Oil is showing negative divergence on weekly chart</li>
<li>U.S. dollar index is in uptrend and testing support at 80</li>
<li>USD/CAD is testing major support at parity</li>
<li>CVE.TO looks weakest amongst top 5 traded Oil/Gas on TSX (for
    liquidity)</li>
<li>Negative divergence as seen on CVE.TO chart (Figure 2)</li>
<li>\$30 is a strong resistance level (Figure 2)</li>
<li>CVE.TO v. Crude Oil chart shows an intermediate term steady down
    trend</li>
</ol>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="512" caption="TSX Composite v.
S&amp;P 500"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-14-TSX-SPX.png" />][][/caption] Stop: \$32. Target: \$27. Commission paid
is \$12.95 on this trade (double that for a round trip). A rough
estimate of the premium by May expiry if CVE.TO is priced at \$32 then
would be \$0.80. Thus, I am risking about \$240 of my \$8,000 account in
this trade on a worst case scenario. Which is 3% of my RRSP account.
This is <em>significantly</em> more than my usual risk appetite (less than 0.2%
per trade in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex trading</a>). But any less would be pointless due to
the high relative commission for options. I had the choice of shorting
the market using options or leveraged bear ETF. The deteriorating value
of a bear ETF made it less favourable for holding for more than a few
days. So I traded options due to a lack of choices in my RRSP. Anyway,
that's my thought on this. Yet nothing matters but the price. Let's wait
and see how this goes. I plan to make one trade per quarter in my RRSP.
This one is for Q2.</p>
