            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've been stopped out of my -2.0 trailing stop placed just minutes ago
this morning. \$135 seems like a strong resistance for SKF. We barely
broke it this morning on decent volume. Furthermore, \$138 is a 50 day
MA and \$140 is a good round number resistance. In other words, there
are a few resistances to be broken going up from here.</p>
<p>Having [entered SKF at \$104 in the new year][], I am content with the
gain for this trade. It has exceeded my original short term target of
120.</p>
<p>However, I would watch SKF and see if it breaks below 130. If it can
stay above 130 today, then that's a very good sign.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>DUG broke my \$25 stop yesterday. I gave it some room because of the
recent \$6 / share distribution on Dec 22. So that effectively shifted
the chart by 6 points. However, the Crude Oil broke above it's 20-day MA
and is showing signs of strength, Figure 2. So I decided to get out of
DUG as my short hedge and move into SKF.</p>
<p>My [DUG shares were bought for \$30][]. Distribution was \$6.06. So my
net lost per share on this trade is [(\$23.44 + \$6.06) - \$30] =
-\$0.5. Which is a total loss of \$0.5 * 34 = \$17 + \$10 commission.
It's basically a breakeven trade.</p>

<p>As I was saying, I replaced DUG with SKF as my short hedge. We are
testing the Oct support on SKF. Furthermore, despite the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/2008-post-holiday-market-analysis/">S&amp;P breaking
above the down channel this week</a> and along with SKF's distribution,
SKF is still above the psychological 100 level.</p>

<p>Stop: \$96, the October support.</p>
<p>Target: \$120, a congestion zone.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is merely a short hedge play so I actualy don't hope
for big gains on this.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>To bail. Not to bail. To bail. Not to bail. Friday's market gapped down
big time on news the bailout failed to pass the senate on Thursday
night. Then just hours later, rumours were surfacing about the White
House stepping in with the TARP money. As of Saturday, FP headline reads
White House holds off on auto bailout.</p>
<p>Since I'm no economist, I am not going to discuss about the auto bailout
here. What matters to me is the market. As I was saying, the market
gapped down Friday morning and even touched 851 in the first few
minutes. However, it hacked its way back up to close positive at 879.73.</p>
<p>We managed to hold this critical 850 support level as I noted in
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/post-market-analysis-december-11-2008/">Thursday's post-market analysis</a>. However, I wouldn't want to add to
the longs at this point because both of my uptrend channels have been
broken. I feel that at this point, it is safer to watch and be more late
into a trend than usual.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to see the S&amp;P 500's behaviour around 860 or
900 (Figure 2), which ever comes first, before adding to my existing
positions.</p>

<p>On a more personal note, my stops for DRYS and SKF were triggered on
Friday.</p>
<p>On December 12, 2008 8:30:32 AM, my -\$1.0 trailing stop for DRYS were
triggered (stop at \$7.90) and my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-200-drys-533/">last 100 shares</a> were sold for a
basement price of \$7.34. I have definitely been a victim by the market
makers gunning for stops. As DRYS pushed higher throughout the day and
closed at \$9.37 on Friday.</p>
<p>As I'm actually away on a trip for these few weeks, I don't think I'll
re-enter DRYS until it clears the resistance at \$12. I simply cannot
watch it as close as I would like.</p>
<p>In any case, I already unloaded half my position [previously at
\$11.11][]. So although I feel I've been ripped off with my stop, I
believe this is overall still a good trade because I unloaded on
strength and have set a reasonable (using my channel) stop just in case
it turns back down on me while I'm away.</p>

<p>My Ultrashort Financials (SKF) stop was triggered on Friday too. This
one I am a little dumbfounded. I have set my trailing stop at -\$17 on
the mark for SKF. The stop price of \$124 was triggered and my 7 shares
were sold for \$124.09. Having [bought at \$128.83 the previous day][],
this is a small loss.</p>
<p>Notice that giant opening spike in the chart below? This is yet another
example of the market makers gunning for the stops. I believe I should
have set a hard stop instead for this one since I'm using it as a hedge.</p>

<p>This is still a trader's market. Since I'm away oversea, I can't manage
my account as effective as I would have liked. Setting the trailing
stops was a safety measure. Although they worked against me this time, I
still think it was a good decision given my circumstances.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am at 50% longs now with no hedge (not good). My other 50% is
in cash. My primary short term goal now is to seek out a good short
entry to hedge my longs. I don't think I have the guts to add anymore
longs until I see more strength in this rally.</p> </div>

DRYS shares yesterday</a>. The main reason is that I'll be away for a
couple of weeks and will have limited access to the market. So it's only
prudent to hedge my long positions in this volatile market.</p>
<p>The 115 level was an obvious resistance yesterday for the Ultrashort
Financials (SKF). I thought of entering at about the 110 back then, but
resisted the temptation to catch a bottom and waited until it can break
through 115. We didn't stay below 115 for long today. And as you can
see, I'm in at 129.</p>

<p>Upside: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/post-market-analysis-december-11-2008/">Market is still in a downtrend</a>. SKF broke above 115
resistance level. High volume test of \$130 resistance (\$129 is 200 day
MA) at end-of-day today. CO and Stochastic are both bullish on the
daily.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$130.</p>
<p>Downside: Still within downtrend channel. Heavy resistance at 130 level.</p>
<p>Support: \$115.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This doesn't look like a good trade. That's why I'm only
entering a small position as a hedge for my longs. Frankly, I hope this
doesn't work out. Since I'll be away, I have set a loose trailing stop.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I bought some SKF today after being <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-30-dug-3163/">stopped out of DUG</a> to hedge my
longs. The low volume in the market made me believe this rally would not
follow through. In addition, the difficulty of S&amp;P to test 870 looked
like a good entry point at the time, Figure 1. Citigroup was also
struggling to break \$7.00 even though S&amp;P made a slightly higher high.
So I was worried about taking a hit for my longs if we're to go down
from here. That's why I made a position in the ultrashort. SKF looked
good because \$150 seemed like a good support and the financials are the
banes of this crash so far.</p>
<p>In hindsight, even the channel on SKF, Figure 2, shows we are in a
downtrend for SKF, so up for the market.</p>
<p>I picked up SKF at 14:28 and was stopped out at 14:54. The reason for my
exit was C breaking above \$7 and then kept on making new highs. My
mental stop was at \$145 too. I kept myself out for the last hour
promising that I would not enter short again unless C can stay below
\$7. That never happened and C closed at \$7.05.</p>

<p>Sold my SKF from a cost basis of [\$102.60 from yesterday][] (fee \$5).
The ETF still seem poised to go higher in the near term. However, since
I'll be off to Taiwan for a few days, I don't want to leave the position
unattended as it is highly volatile. Ideally, I'd like to wait for the
price to reach at least \$110 or later in the week to sell it. Still, I
am satisfied with my small gain and would not risk more for a little
gain (I considered placing a limit sell at \$110).</p>
<p>I still believe SKF has a lot of potential for a much higher price in
the coming weeks to about > \$120 based on the fundamentals (i.e. the
<a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/09/i-got-75b-but-i.html">laughable spin by the media on Buffett's deal with Goldman Sach</a>) and
