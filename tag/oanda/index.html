            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Once upon a time, I was a happy forex student. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper traded</a> on
Oanda for a few months and even opened a live account with them. Then my
work place tightened up our internet firewall at work. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-to-do-when-life-gets-in-your-way-of-trading/">couldn't
access market data anymore</a> during the day. Fortunately, Dukascopy at
the time said that they'll be <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">enabling micro-lot trading</a>. So I moved
to practice with Dukascopy. Then last weekend, Dukascopy said <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/no-micro-lot-trading-at-dukascopy-metatrader-4-accounts/">no
micro-lot trading on their Metatrader 4 accounts</a>. I move to another
broker again. My last stop (so far) is at MB Trading. However, after
practicing with them for a week, I remembered why I didn't go with them
in the first place. They don't offer Canadian denominated account
currency! Fortunately, they do say that they're in the process of
enabling more account currencies. But who knows how long that might
take? My head is spinning from all this mess. I don't think I am asking
too much from a forex broker. I just want five features from them.</p>
<ol>
<li>good reputation</li>
<li>micro-lot trading</li>
<li>Metatrader platform</li>
<li>free API access</li>
<li>Canadian dollar denominated account currency</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all! Why am I being shut out everytime just when I am about to
open a live account? On top of that trouble, there's the question of
which trading platform to use. Over the past few months, I have tried
many forex brokers and their forex trading platforms. From proprietary
ones like FXTrade (Oanda), JForex (Dukascopy), and Dealbook 360 (GFT) to
the popular, third-party Metatrader 4 platform. I decided to settle with
Metatrader 4 because its charting is sufficient and scripting on it is
fairly easy. I learned MQL4 (MT4's scripting language) in a few hours
and wrote my first EA in a few days. The problem with Metatrader 4
though, is Metatrader 5. Scripts written for MT4 is incompatible on MT5.
As I intend to trade semi-automatically via expert advisors, this is a
huge problem for me. I don't want to start developing for MT4 and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">only
to have to convert everything again</a>. I thought I could evade this
MT4-MT5 dilemma with a non-American forex broker (<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143">Dukascopy</a>) as
they're more likely to stay with MT4. But now that I can't trade with
them anymore, my best potential broker is MB Trading. Which is probably
upgrading to MT5 once it's out. Note: MT5 is built for new NFA
regulations, so American brokers probably have to upgrade. I think I
have had enough moves for now. So screw this all! I will focus on
learning Python programming for the next few weeks. While waiting for MB
Trading to adopt Canadian dollar accounts (or I come across a new
broker), and the duel between Metatrader 4 and 5 is settled.</p>

Update: It doesn't look as though Dukascopy will proceed with using MT4.
So you might as well look for another broker if you need MT4 or [learn
to use JForex][] if you plan on sticking with Dukascopy. Just received
the following news from [Dukascopy][] (attached below) regarding their
Metatrader accounts. Basically, they are raising their minimum lot-size
on MT4-enabled accounts to a mini-lot (10k). Micro-lot (1000 units)
trading remains exclusive to their basic (JForex only) accounts. Well,
why do bad news keep coming to me just when I'm about to go live with a
forex broker? First it was Oanda (although the problem was at my end
with them), then Dukascopy. There's no way I'm able to trade with a
mini-lot because of my strict [risk management][] rules. So I would be
stuck with the JForex platform for a while if I'm going to trade with
them. I like the JForex platform. It is simple, clean, easy to use, and
powerful. However, Metatrader is just substantially more popular. There
are hundreds of free scripts, indicators, and expert advisers published
at MQL4.com for me to edit to my liking. If I go with JForex, I'd have
to write everything from scratch. The whole point of me using a built-in
editor is to save time. So I might as well program in Python and use an
API if I need to go through learning JForex scripting, programming, and
testing. As much as I like [Dukascopy][] (35% commission rebate
affiliate link), ~~I may not be going through to trade with them
anymore. Unfortunate, really.~~

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just sent in my paper work to <a href="http://fxtrade.oanda.com/">Oanda</a> to open a live forex account
with them last week. Then I heard from @InEgoVeritas the news about
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143">Dukascopy</a> (get 35% discount on commission with that link) reducing
their minimum lot size to micro-lots. After doing more research
comparing Oanda and Dukascopy in the last 24 hours, I think I will go
with Dukascopy in the long term. But I won't make the switch just yet.
Here are my reasons why. Before getting to that, I need to describe my
situation. Choosing a forex broker is like buying a car, we are all
unique and what fits me might not be right for you. Long story short
though. My goal all along is to split my funds 50/50 between interactive
trading and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading</a>. Since Oanda's API access cost \$600
per month, I was to open an additional account with <a href="http://www.mbtrading.com/">MB Trading</a> for
automated trading once I have developed something consistent. In
addition to this latest news from Dukascopy, they also lowered their
minimal opening balance down to \$5,000, and began beta testing for
Metatrader 4 recently (Update: Dukascopy abandoned MT4)! Both Oanda and
Dukascopy are very reputable forex brokers. But Dukascopy has the huge
advantage of providing a free API access. That is one big motivation for
me to go trade with them. Then I can just do everything in one account!
But as I said, I will proceed with live trading with Oanda as planned
soon (once I am out of this drawdown from being <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/early-bird-does-not-get-the-worm-in-forex-trading/">too early in shorting
Aussie</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">other pairs</a>). The reason is that Dukascopy has always
been catered towards institutional or big pocket forex traders. This
aggressive move to welcome retail traders and small timers could be good
and bad. The good part is more business and more buzz for their service,
obviously. The bad part though, is that widening the door to a new
market can turn out stinking the entire operation. It would be analogous
to Mercedes suddenly decided to compete in the budget cars market... oh
wait, they did that! (Mercedes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_B-Class">B-class</a>, enough said) More
specifically regarding Dukascopy, I am most concerned of the impact on
the quality and speed of their trading service. As well as their
customer service. Let's face it, we know that new forex traders (such as
myself) whine a lot and expect a lot for little to nothing. Since I have
my paper work done with Oanda already, it can't hurt to just wait a few
more months to see how the changes go. Nevertheless, I am thrilled of
the new changes with Dukascopy! In the mean time, I will continue to
work on my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-psychology/">trading psychology</a>, and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading
strategy</a> (great plug, isn't it?). Update December 2010: I moved my
account over to Dukascopy and have been with them for a few months. So
far so good. My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/jforex/">automated trading development with JForex</a> has been
going well too.</p> </div>
