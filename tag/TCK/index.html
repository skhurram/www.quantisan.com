            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I wrote last Friday, I took a long position in Teck Resources
(TCK-B.TO) at \$36.03 but got <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-110-tck-b-to-36-03-stopped-out-at-breakeven/">stopped out at breakeven</a>. In
hindsight, the retracement after testing the \$37 resistance held the
50% level near the close. That was a bullish sign that I missed at the
time and only realized during my weekend review. As you know, the TSX
market gapped about 2% up and S&amp;P gapped about 4% up right at the open.
The market traded in a range all day but managed to hold the gap.
However, EUR/USD closed its gap and is testing 1.27 support as I write
this. The EUR/USD pair will be an important pair to watch as the
European Union drama unfolds. With regard to TCK, Figure 1 speaks for
itself. It gapped up about 8% and closed up 8.78% at \$39.53. I decided
not to chase the market early on today as the reward/risk ratio just
isn't as appealing anymore. There are always opportunities sailing
around the corner. So there is no need to go out of breath chasing that
one missed boat.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Update May 10: Looks like I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-illustration-of-what-it-means-by-missing-the-boat-in-trading/">missed the boat</a>. TCK.B gapped up almost
7% at the Monday open to \$38.88. I won't be chasing the market at this
point as the reward/risk ratio isn't appealing anymore. Update: I got
stopped out at breakeven (after commission) before I can post this piece
at the end of the day. I'm back to all cash going into the weekend. I am
taking a dip in Teck Resources (TCK/B.TO) with 110 shares bought at
\$36.03. This is a trade to "buy when everyone else is in fear".
Following my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/to-hell-and-back-a-review-of-tsx-after-a-v-day/">assessment of the market yesterday</a>, I don't think
things are that bad, yet. So I am establishing a small position in a
strong company today. TCK is trading on its 200 day moving average at
\$35 this week (Figure 1). Yesterday's epic dive and recovery didn't
break this \$35 support. So that's a very good sign for TCK.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Tech Resources
(TCK-B.TO)"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-05-07-TCK-B.TO.png" />][][/caption] Furthermore, \$35 is an obvious
psychological round number support. It is also above the recent low of
\$32.50 printed in February of this year as shown in Figure 1. The
oscillator value (top of Figure 1) is making a positive divergence as
TCK is testing this support level). I entered today based on the 5-day
intraday chart. This morning's opening hour test of \$35 support has
lower volume than earlier this week (Figure 2). As such, I think \$35
can hold. So I entered when the price shot above minor resistance at
\$36.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="TCK-B.TO

drifted back under \$35.50 after I entered but then reversed and tested
\$37. I moved my stop loss to breakeven as it touched an equidistance
price opposite of my stop. Just so I don't see profits turn into losses.
If I get stopped out today, I will not re-enter until after the weekend.
My target is \$40 and original stop was \$35 for about a 4 to 1 reward
to risk ratio. I am risking 1.25% in this trade with a position size of
110 shares.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I took some time today during lunch to study the move of TCK. TCK made
it above \$5.00 in the morning with mediocre volume. Then I watched it
break above \$5 again around noon and it was disappointingly
unspectacular. This isn't a good sign. On top of this, S&amp;P 500 seems to
be on the verge of breaking below the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/pre-market-analysis-march-20-2009/">support of 780 as I've noted in
the morning pre-market analysis</a>. So I decided to place a stop to
close my long-held position at \$4.87, just below yesterday's intra-day
trough at \$4.88. TCK was marked at \$4.98 or so at the time.</p>
<p>Then at 13:19, my stop was triggered. Two hours later, TCK is now
trading at \$4.65. The S&amp;P is holding out at 770, which isn't all that
bad. Perhaps this is just a shakeout before another leg of this bull
run. Perhaps 800 was indeed the end of this leg of the rally. I'm not
sure at the moment. What matters is that [from my analysis, there is a
higher risk than reward expectancy at the moment][]. So I'm just saving
my chips rather than risk them over the weekend.</p>
