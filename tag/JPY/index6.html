            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After many trials and errors with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trading</a> the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/forex/">forex market</a>
for a month, the first of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-signal/">trading setups</a> is finally taking shape.
So I would like to document this approach here after a well executed
trade this week (illustrated below). This trading setup is based solely
on technical analysis. Here's an overview of the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a long term time frame for identifying setup.</li>
<li>Draw the major supports and resistances.</li>
<li>Add a momentum technical indicator.</li>
<li>Add a trend indicator.</li>
<li>An entry is signaled by an agreement of the trend and the indicator
    at the support or resistance price level. Do not enter yet.</li>
<li>Define a short term time frame for timing, use this for the
    following steps.</li>
<li>Draw the supports and resistances on this short time frame.</li>
<li>Place an order when the price breaks the short-term trend to be
    aligned with the trend on the longer one.</li>
<li>Exit when the entry conditions are gone (not necessarily reversed).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is very vague. So here's a real example in practice. Figure 1 shows
steps 1 to 5 on the daily chart of CAD/JPY for a short entry. The entry
point is the bar before the marked vertical line on Oct 21. See that
CAD/JPY tested the descending resistance line (step #2) with a negative
RSI divergence (#3). The trend as suggested by the moving averages is a
choppy downtrend (#4). Thus, the conditions were met and a short entry
is signaled. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"
caption="CAD/JPY"][<img alt="CAD/JPY" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy.png" />]<a href="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy.png">CAD/JPY</a>[/caption] For timing the
entry, Figure 2 is a 3-hour chart of CAD/JPY with the entries and exits
marked. Yellow triangles are entries and red dots are exits. I entered a
full position after CAD/JPY made the initial dive and then retraced to
the previous support (now resistance) line. It bounced right off that
line strongly (left side of figure). I entered at market price once we
made a hammer candlestick (negative signal) the bar before. Stop was
placed at 88.0, near the recent high and at a round number resistance.
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="CAD/JPY,
3-hour"][<img alt="CAD/JPY, 3-hour" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy_3h.png" />]<a href="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/2009-10-29-cadjpy_3h.png">CAD/JPY, 3-hour</a>[/caption] For the exit,
I had a manually adjusted hard stop to be a couple of resistances away.
I kept it loose on purpose because this position was my biggest winner.
(Let your profits run). But once the RSI on the daily passed below 50, I
took a more conservative approach on the exit stop. Then once CAD/JPY
tested 84.50 and hung around 85.0, I tightened my stop and was taken out
at 85.30. Note that my original target was 84.0, so I thought testing
84.50 was close enough. Also note that this setup is expected to be
executed recursively. It is meant to be run so that you're <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">stacking up
your winning position</a> if the conditions and the trend is in your
favour. This is actually where the power with this setup kicks in. I'll
continue with the CAD/JPY example to illustrate this point. Notice in
Figure 2 that I added to this CAD/JPY short at the (second from the
right) yellow triangle point on the chart at 86.3 for 50% more units.
The down move was still intact as shown in Figure 1 at the time. Using
the same setup, I added more units to this position. And by adding 50%
more to my position, I was able to ride that last wave down for +200
pips on these extra units. Otherwise, I would have exited at 85.30 on
the consolidation around 85.0 and left with nothing on the market for
the last big wave. The timing as shown in Figure 2 for this addition
isn't the same as for the original entry. But it's obvious enough on the
figure with the same markings which I used. Simply refer to Figure 2 for
a visual explanation on the timing for this entry. In case you haven't
noticed on Figure 2, but I just re-entered this position with half the
size using the same setup. Since this third entry is still in progress,
I can't comment on it just yet. We'll see how it goes. Finally, for ease
of referencing this trading setup later on, I will call this particular
setup, FTC (forex trend-continuation). Right now it's version 0.1, a
first publication release but still in beta testing with my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper
trading</a>. Once the setup has proven itself, I will use it in live
trading with real money. Then I will christen it with a version 1.0, and
perhaps a better name. In the mean time, I expect more refinement to
this setup as I continue to try it out on paper trading. Check my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTC">FTC
tag</a> for more sample applications of this trading signal. Update Nov
18, 2009: I've changed the name from FTCS to FTC as I now have a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/FTR">FTR</a>
setup.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I shorted AUD/JPY on the 20th and then shorted EUR/JPY on the 21st. Both
positions were stopped out before Tokyo opened tonight. I didn't write
an opening post for EUR/JPY because it's the same as usual, long term
setup, short term timing. I'll briefly go over the two trades here and
what I have learned in hindsight. First let's talk about the AUD/JPY
trade. I wrote about the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-50-83-60-stop-85-50/">entry here</a>. Figure 1 shows the daily chart.
AUD/JPY has managed to edge out of its channel with an obvious negative
divergence on the RSI. However, it feels as though it's going to turn
any time soon as seen in Fig. 2. I'm not going to try again though
because I need to learn to trade what I see and what I feel. I shouldn't
even consider to short it until its below the short term channel. For
this AUD/JPY short entry, I entered too early because I drew my channel
too tight. If you compare Fig. 2 in this post with Fig. 2 from the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-short-audjpy-50-83-60-stop-85-50/">entry post</a>, you'll see that the supporting line is lower
here. The previous line didn't enclose everything as it should. For my
EUR/JPY trade, I tried to short the top again.... <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules">When will I learn</a>?
Fig. 3 shows the setup on the daily. EUR/JPY is obviously testing a
strong resistance. So far so good. Fig. 4 shows the 3-hour chart for my
entry (yellow inverted triangle to the right, the last red dot is the
exit). This is where I failed. EUR/JPY was testing 137 and the top of
the channel before I entered. Then once I saw that EUR/JPY failed to
touch 137 again for a few bars, I entered. Shorting a new top is
ill-advised because the price can consolidate upward along with the
channel as shown in Fig. 4. You'll be fighting a losing battle as the
momentum is working against you. In any case, the lesson from both of
these trades is that I need to learn to be more patient with my entry.
The loss for AUD/JPY is -130 pips for -\$29.82 and the loss for EUR/JPY
is -77 pips for -\$26.46. At least my position size was halved because I
knew these are risky trades. Note: All the charts were taken just now
after the exit. [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="580"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I placed this order to short AUD/JPY before going to bed last night. The
order was filled overnight. I have tweaked my strategy a little and this
is a first test. I think I need to start naming my strategies and giving
them version number. It will make it easier to keep track in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">my trading
log</a> and for quick comparisons. Here's what I saw to make me throw my
dice at this pair. Figure 1 is the daily and Figure 2 is the 3-hour
chart. My reasoning are as follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>AUD/JPY is testing the top of a channel, Fig. 1</li>
<li>Its RSI is pushing above 80, a level not seen since January when it
    was trading about 67.50.</li>
<li>USD/JPY tested 91 and headed downward.</li>
<li>AUD/USD heading up to the sky with a worsening divergence.</li>
<li>EUR/JPY (a recent <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-eurjpy-135-00-500-1-pips/">+500 pips trade</a>) failed to break 136 and
    showing an evident negative divergence too.</li>
<li>Short term testing of ascending support line, Fig. 2. (Should have
    given this more room though)</li>
</ol>
<p>Position size: 50%, another 50% waiting to enter below 82.90 Entry:
83.60 Stop: 85.50, see Fig. 1. Target: 77.50, bottom of channel, see
Fig. 1. Reward / Risk =610 / 190 = 3.2. The stop is a lot wider than my
previous trades because I'm finding it not worth my time to micro-manage
my trades. However, notice that my total position size is adjusted
accordingly to not risk more than 1% of my forex portfolio in a trade.
My focus is on the daily so it's only natural to give it more room as
I'm not a prophet and couldn't tell when a trade would work out. This is
one of the revision made to this strategy as learned from my recent
lessons. A trade is only as good as what you have learned from it.
Profit is only secondary.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my successful EUR/JPY long just before the weekend with a tight
stop. Notice from Figure 1 that EUR/JPY is now in overbought territory.
In addition, a negative divergence is developing on the RSI from the
recent 2 peaks also at 135.00. The best thing about this trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-eurjpy-long-100-129-99-stop-128-80/">my
entry</a>. However, I certainly didn't chop this setup the best I could.
Even though I rode this up for +500 pips, I only had a 50% position
size. There were two easily identifiable adding points which I could
have taken advantage of. When EUR/JPY broke above 132.00, which was a
clear short-term resistance, a day after my entry I should have added to
my position then because of short-term momentum. Another chance came at
132.50 or so. As shown in Figure 2, when the price retested the low end
of the channel at 132.50. Both of these opportunities would have
survived with my usual stop of 100 pips. Another disappointment was that
my second half of the position was stopped out shortly because I moved
my stop up too soon. I was confident enough when I placed the order to
enter a full position size. But my over-zealous need to reduce risk got
the better of me. I observed on a daily time frame but traded in the
3-hour. To be more accurate in pointing the finger, it was my lack of
patience that stopped out my other half of the position. Anyway, I did
rode the wave with a sufficient position size. One thing I just noticed
is the T formation in Figure 2. EUR/JPY is back to where it started a
month ago. Where it heads now is uncertain. I will keep an eye on this
pair and aim to re-enter another long in a few days. The trend is your
friend.</p>
