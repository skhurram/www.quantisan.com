            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-all-cadjpy-long-88-40-for-152-pips/">booked my profit on my CAD/JPY long</a> last night mere pips away from
the top. It was a lucky move, that's all. Now it looks as though CAD/JPY
will do one of the following: <!--more--></p>
<ol>
<li>Break down from here. A break below 86.50 will confirm an
    intermediate term downtrend. However, I don't expect CAD/JPY to spin
    on a dime right after testing an obvious resistance. So I think #2
    is more likely.</li>
<li>False breakdown to above 86.50, retrace to 88.00, and hang around
    this range for a few more days then initiate an intermediate term
    price fall (#1).</li>
<li>Although unlikely, case #3 is still possible. CAD/JPY can remain
    suppressed at this 87 price level and creep upward deviously to test
    89.30.</li>
</ol>
<p>The difference between #1 and #2 could be subtle. But I couldn't bank
on either one yet because the reward/risk isn't favourable at this
moment. So I'm going to stay on the sideline and wait for a better price
or for the signs to be clearer. On another note, I'm still keeping an
eye on gold and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/AUD/">Aussie</a>. There should be a big one soon.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>CAD/JPY reached my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-cadjpy-86-88-stop-86-10-target-88-0/">target of 88.00 last Friday</a>. It broke through
88.00 nicely and tested 88.50 on Tokyo open just now. I decided to book
my profit in the demo account on this CAD/JPY long position entered at
86.88 and 87.87. See Figure 1 for the 3-hour chart with the entries and
exits marked. Main reason for my cold feet is that there's a lot of
resistance on CAD/JPY above 88.50, all the way to 90.70, from the daily
chart (not shown). I couldn't tell if CAD/JPY will continue pushing
upward or retrace. So I'm booking my profit now to observe the price
action from the sideline. This position has turned out +40 pips more
than I expected, so I'm trying not to be too greedy in this volatile
time. The net profit on this <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper trade</a> amounts to +0.3% of my demo
account. The yellow triangle in Figure 1 shows my exit. I risked 0.1% on
the initial entry (first blue triangle). Then added 70% more to the
position above a weak resistance level (second blue triangle) and moved
the stop on the initial size to breakeven.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I entered CADJPY long at market for 86.88 just now. This is a
continuation of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-usdcad-short-1-0540-for-131-pips/">previous USDCAD short</a> position. However, USDJPY
is on a run upward so I'm switching to go long on the loonie with yen
instead. Figure 1 shows the daily chart of CADJPY. Notice the imminent
MACD bullish crossover and the already in-play stochastic upturn. I like
it. My stop loss level is set at 86.10. It's the high of a previous peak
on February 3, two weeks ago. My target is the round number 88
resistance. 88.0 has been an important price level for CADJPY for the
past few months. So I'm setting my sight there.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="CADJPY,
daily"][<img alt="" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-02-17-cadjpy_d.gif" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows my timing for this entry. CADJPY is noticeably meeting
some resistance at 87.50. 87.50 is also the 61.8% Fibonacci level of a
recent down move. This is a cause for concern on my long position as we
could very well retrace here. However, the bullishness of CADJPY is
apparent in Figure 2. Prices have consistently been bought for the past
few days right on the short term moving average (teal line).
Furthermore, the intermediate term moving average (orange line) is about
to cross the long term moving average (red line) as I enter this
position.</p>
<p>Lastly, gold price has taken a dive from 1130 to 1100. Meanwhile, crude
oil price is holding the 77 support nicely. Thus, this confirm my
previous view that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-change-of-wind-for-australian-dollar-shorted-audusd-0-9183-and-audcad-0-9546/">oil has better upside than gold</a> in the
intermediate term. Which is why I've been trading the loonie these past
weeks.</p>
<p>For this particular CADJPY trade, I have another buy order waiting above
current support level to add to my long position. Let's see if CADJPY
can break decisively to the upside in the next 24 hours as US and
Canadian data comes out.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p><strong>Update:</strong> I've switched over to long EURJPY @ 125.40 as EURGBP's
downtrend seem to be running out of steam. Moreover, EURJPY looks better
on the daily chart with a clear support and an oversold reading. I'm
back in my long GBPJPY play at 145.24. The currency pair is breaking an
hourly resistance since consolidating around 145. I had a low ball offer
at 144.20 since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-closed-gbpjpy-146-42-for-140-pips/">taking my profit last night at 146.42</a>. But that bid
for never filled. So I'm re-entering on a short-term breakout. For this
entry, I am risking 0.1% of my account. This re-entry is a tough
decision. Almost all the respectable pros that I <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Quantisan">follow on Twitter</a>
are on the other side of this trade via other currency pairs. However,
my long setup is valid as long as GBPJPY is above 144 level. So I'll
take this trade until proven otherwise. Although I must admit that my
confidence in this trade is very low. I also considered long CADJPY
instead as it seems to offer more upside potential. However, as I've
been following the GBPJPY pair this week, I'll stick with my plan. I
also have a limit order to add more at 145.81 as you can see in Figure 1
below.</p>
