            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This week's market action is practically a carbon copy of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-18-2009/">the week
before</a>. We started on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/end-of-the-6-week-rally-and-back-with-the-year-long-beartoday/">Monday with a huge gap down</a>, regained some
footing on Tuesday and Wednesday, dipped lower on Thursday, then climbed
back to the level of the Friday before. Obviously, we're in a trading
range these past two weeks around 830 - 870 on the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>From Figure 1, we're still in the over bought level, with signs of
divergence, etc. etc. You've heard this tune before, so I won't repeat
myself. The only thing for certain in this volatile market is that ...
it's volatile. So no matter which side of the trade you're on, I'd be
more picky in this market.</p>
<p>Obviously, the support is at 830 and resistance is at 870 as I've said.
Also, notice from Figure 1 that volume has been relatively low in this
range so far. If there is any breakout either way, volume and momentum
would be the things to watch.</p>
<p>As of right now, my portfolio consists of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/review-of-positions-srs-and-uso/">SRS, USO</a>, and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/eslr/">ESLR</a>
(<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-250-eslr-599848/">from way back</a>). Needless to say, my SRS is at the bottom of the sea
with a 50% loss for the trade. This is just unacceptable. I have since
written <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/3-rules/">my trading rules in stone</a> and vowed to never break a stop.</p>
<p>On the plus side, this has certainly woken me up again as I've been
getting complacent lately in my trading regimen. Thus I'm relieving
myself to just light trading and heading back to trading development and
would spend most of my time improving my systems and skills.</p>

<p><strong>GICS Sectors Review</strong></p>
<p>This week there isn't any particular sector that was way ahead of the
pack. The ones that lag have been the usual defensive plays, Healthcare,
Consumer Staples, etc.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market has continued to chug along upward this week. In last week's
review, I said the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-april-14-2009/">market was obviously in a short term rally run</a>.
And just like last week, this up run is looking weak from the indicators
(Figure 1). Yet, as weak as it might seem, the fact is that the market
is breaking resistances one after another. We ended the week on another
significant resistance at 875 on the S&amp;P 500. This is definitely a level
to watch next week. However, do note that we have tested this level on a
lower volume on Friday. So it's likely that we'll fail to break this
resistance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, from Figure 2, you can clearly see that we've been
adhering to a tight uptrend channel formed from the beginning of March.
From that chart, we can glean that our support is about 860. Thus, our
narrow trading range is 860 - 875 in the short term for next week. And
the major levels would be 830 and 900, from long term lines shown in
Figure 2.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that we'll be seeing 830 before 900 from the weakening
rally. However, I've been proven wrong many times before. In any case,
just watch the levels I noted and let the market tell you where it is
heading.</p>

<p><strong>GICS Sectors Review</strong></p>
<p>On the 6-month and 3-month charts, it's easy to see that although the
Financials have been playing catch-up lately, they still have a lot of
grounds to make up for. The Telecoms still remain the top performer with
the Techs in the second spot.</p>
<p>Notice that on the 5-day chart, we can see the top performers
(Financials and Industrials) have retraced in the last hour for most of
the week. This is a bearish sign.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm back from my long weekend. S&amp;P 500 has broken above 850 and tested
860 on Monday while I was away.</p>
<p>On Monday, we made a failed attempt to rush through 860. A similar
scenario happened at 830 and 840 in the past 2 weeks. Each time, the
market dipped slightly but managed to climb even further up (Figure 1).
Would history repeat itself the third time?</p>
<p>The 10 day MA for S&amp;P500 (SPY) has stayed above the 40 day MA since
March 26 now. That's more than 2 weeks of run. This hasn't happened
since Sept 2008, and even then it wasn't that long. This is definitely
the longest up run we've had since 2006!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the indicators are looking as toppy as ever (Figure
1). In addition, the down trend as shown in Figure 2 is still intact,
and this decreasing volume rally can only confirm it.</p>
<p>In the intermediate term, I'm still bearish. Yet, I must admit that this
run has been pumping up and up for a lot longer than I expected. As a
trader, the most easiest way to make money is to go with the flow. As of
now, the flow of the market is up, unless proven otherwise. So my
strategy now is to wait and observe the retracement before rebalancing
my positions, if needed. I'm net short since last week.</p>
<p>Some key intermediate term levels for the S&amp;P 500 are: 38% Fibonacci at
790, 40 day MA at 780, 200 day MA still high above at 970 or so.</p>

<p><strong>GICS Sector Review</strong></p>
<p>From the 6 months chart, we can see that the Financials (XLF) is fast
approaching the support from December of 2008. The V-shaped bounce has
been fierce particularly for XLF.</p>
<p>This XLF bounce is even more evident in the 1 month and 5 days charts.
It's common knowledge that this type of climb up is hardly sustainable.
Thus, everyone is watching the Financials as usual for any signs of
weakness. And if that happens, the market can quickly turn ugly.
However, the inevitable retracement doesn't have to be deep. It could
very well dip, consolidate, and rocket up again.</p>
<p>Given the longer term perspective of the market as described in the
first section, I doubt that though. In any case, just watch the
Financials as an indicator.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I said on Tuesday, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-is-looking-ready-to-continue-its-bear-rally/">the market looked like it's going up</a>, and
going up it went. In last week's review, I also said <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-march-29-2009/">we're in a
congestion zone around 820 - 830</a> for the S&amp;P 500. Well, we finally
broke above 830, yet, the volume was light. We had acceptable volume on
Thursday when we broke through 840 for the first time in this up leg,
but the follow through on Friday was disappointing. We reached
marginally higher on Friday but the volume was almost non-existent.</p>
<p>Looking at Figure 2, we can see that 840 is exactly the point when we
ended our first crash in October 10, 2008. If we are to break that
resistance, we definitely need more momentum than what Friday provided
us. As it stand now, this 840 is a critical pivot point in both the long
and short term. Thus, we could be in for some more range-bound trading
as the market bounces around this level prior to a big move. However,
note that we've been in this range for over a week already ... so this
is a good time to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-gs-100-apr-09-105-put-955/">manage your risks</a> in case the market gaps against
your favour.</p>
<p>Also, Thursday's gap up provided a nice point to draw a new bullish
channel. And what do you know, the supports are pegged at 820 and 800
again ...<strong>This is going to be one big move one way or the other with
everything seemingly coming together in the short and long term</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>GICS Sectors Review</strong></p>
<p>From the 6-month chart, we see that the Financial (XLF) and Industrial
(SLI) are still testing their respective resistances from February. On
the other end of the run, the Technology and Telecom sectors (XLK, IYZ)
has broken above several resistances and is leading the pack. This is
definitely something to keep in mind, i.e. <strong>find values in the
Techs/Telecom to ride upon on the way up</strong>. Basic Materials (XLB) is a
close third.</p>
<p>From the 1-month chart, it's pretty clear that the financial made a
dead-cat's bounce this month and led the pack by a good margin.
Healthcare (XLV), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Utilities (XLU), a.k.a.
the defensive sectors, are at the bottom of the pack. This is no doubt
yet another mark of a bear rally as people are pulling money from these
safe havens into more riskier sectors.</p>
<p>More importantly though, of the top 5 leading sectors in this month's
rally, only the Industrial (XLI) failed to make a new high in this
week's run compared to the week before. This is definitely a big thumb
down for the Industrial. Which coincides with my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">analysis for General
Electric (GE)</a>, in particular, so far. <strong>Correction:</strong> Upon closer
inspection of the individual tickers, both XLF and XLI are making a
short term double top.</p>
<p>The 5-day chart is basically a zoomed in version of the 1-month. Thus,
we're still in a bear rally mode this week. Actually, we see that the
Healthcare (XLV) is lagging even farther to its two other friends (XLP,
XLU) for the week.</p>
