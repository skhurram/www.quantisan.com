<p>The only thing for certain at this point in the market is that there're
a lot of uncertainties. Notice the several big swing days near the
October low but with open and close near each other (a.k.a. the doji's).
Are we at the bottom yet? I don't know. Have we started a rally attempt
this week? Definitely! Is it going to hold? My intuition says likely.</p>
<p>Why do I say that? Three reasons. Fundamentally, the joint effort by
world central banks to inject billions of dollars into the capital
market isn't going to be unnoticed. Secondly, the up days this week has
been marked by some strong late-day climb across the market. This
suggest the pros/smart money are buying. Thirdly, also notice the
significant volume at the doji last Friday, when the market reached a
new low. Subsequently, the decline in the last two days has been on much
lower, and declining volume.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the fear and panic are still very much alive.
Profit-taking will create some serious resistance going up. Also, the
market has been very irrational lately, so any fundamental or technical
analysis could very well be thrown out the window.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, I believe an intermediate term bull phrase is taking
shape, yet be very cautious in your approach and use a conservative risk
management approach. I am not going to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-errors-lessons-being-long-just-before-the-october-2008-crash/">repeat my errors from last
month</a> when I entered full long just before the biggest market crash

[![S&P 500 review][]][]
:   S&P 500 review

</div>

<p></p>
I have been waiting to go long in this bear market for a few weeks now,
hoping for a bottom soon (first of my errors).  Then on week of
September 29th, I decided to go all in (error #2).  S&amp;P closed at 1099
that Friday.  A week later, on October 10th, the Friday close of S&amp;P 500
was 899 points, and I am still left holding on (error #3).</p>
<p>Error #4 though, requires some explaination.  Simply put, I was not
reading the chart as I should have.  While both the price action and
contrarian sentiments were bullish, I totally missed out on a basic
technical analysis indicator ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â? the volume.  Looking at
the above chart, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to see that the first
downward break of the trendline in mid-September was confirmed with
volume.  The volume on that day (left blue arrow), and for that entire
week, is substantially higher than usual.  The subsequent mini rally
attempt before the next break has been marked with little volume.  This
suggests that market participants, particularly the longs, still
havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t flocked in yet.</p>
<p>Seeing that, I [should at least reduce my position size by exiting some
of my most weak positions][] (i.e. least profitable positions) before
the weekend.</p>
<p>While this is not my costliest lesson in trading, it illustrates some
very fundamental lessons which I should <strong>reiterate</strong>, because I should
have known better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Never try to pick the top or bottom.  Which I thought I learned from
    my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures trading</a> already.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/">Manage risk according to volatility</a>.</li>
<li>Exit at any cost if it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look right in a bear
    market.</li>
<li>DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get fixated on the individual stocks, look at
    the bigger picture.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
Actually, I think this all boils down to proper <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>One of my favourite financial blogs, <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com">The Big Picture</a>, led us to this
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/10102008/watch.html">intellectual discussion of the current market crisis</a>. Highly
recommended for anyone seeking to make some sense of the current
turmoil.</p>
<p>
Here's an exerpt:

> **GEORGE SOROS:**And it's a false ideology. Both Marxism and market
> fundamentalism are false ideologies.
>
> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>Is there an ideology that...</p>
<p><strong>GEORGE SOROS:</strong>Is not false?</p>
<p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>GEORGE SOROS:</strong>I think the only one is the one that I'm proposing;
namely, the recognition that all our ideas, all our human constructs
have a flaw in it. And perfection is not attainable. And we must
engage in critical thinking and correct our mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>BILL MOYERS:</strong>And that's one...</p>
<p><p>
<strong>GEORGE SOROS:</strong>That's my ideology. As a child, I experienced
Fascism, the Nazi occupation and then Communism, two false ideologies.
And I learned that both of those ideologies are false. And now I was
shocked when I found that even in a democracy people can be misled to
the extent that we've been misled in the last few years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a bit about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_soros">George Soros from Wikipedia</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soros' 2008 book, <em>The New Paradigm for Financial Markets</em>, describes
a "superbubble" that has built up over the past 25 years and is now
ready to collapse. This is the third in a series of books he's written
that have predicted disaster. As he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><div>
</p>
<p>
I have a record of crying wolfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. I did it first in
<em>The Alchemy of Finance</em> (in 1987), then in <em>The Crisis of Global
Capitalism</em> (in 1998) and now in this book. So it's three books
predicting disaster. (After) the boy cried wolf three times . . .
the wolf really came.
</div></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his
predictions are wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><div>
</p>
<p>
<strong>I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong</strong>*ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ I
basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often
used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you
are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight. When [I] make the
decision, the backache goes away.
</div></p>

The DJIA is too manipulated. <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/gm-falls-1950-levels-european/story.aspx?guid={C503DCF6-2571-42CD-AFA4-682958304034}">GM was downgraded today by S&amp;P</a>,
conveniently when GM is testing it's long term low. Just where the heck
were these guys a few weeks back? Do they think we're idiots? This is
blatant market manipulation! Anyway, enough with the vent. I was just
going to point out this week's market plunge with respect to the longer
term picture. S&amp;P 500 at 903 today is just shy of its 900 support. Next
support would be 750. The million dollar question is, will we see 750 or
1000 first?</p>
