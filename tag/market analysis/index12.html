            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Good news is, the e-mini S&amp;P futures has moved up overnight. Bad news
is, it's still resting on the lower end of a slightly up trend from
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-recollection-of-my-analysis-for-buying-when-sp-broke-down-to-820-today/">last Thursday's 95 point rally</a>. For a confirmed follow through, we
need to at least break above the 870 level during market hours. If S&amp;P
do break above 870, then my target is 920 and possibly 940, the upper
range of this uptrend. However, and it looks like a distinct possibility
from here, if we break below 845 / 836 (200 bma) today, then 800 is an
obvious target. Breaking below 800 would mean 770 is in the works. A
bear trap / bull shakeout could also occur at the 820 level, that would
be the line in the sand for a rally or breakdown for the intermediate
term.</p>

<p>US Dollar Index is in a slow downtrend as we speak. We could retrace to
87.20 and then head back down to 85.70. Breaking below 85.70 without
retracement would be a strong sign of this breakdown. Moving above 87.0
at this point would be signs of strength. So I would watch the action
above 87.0 and below 86.0 today.</p>

<p>Lastly, gold is still in a strong uptrend. Breaking below 795 would
signal caution to a big retracement or even a downturn. Otherwise, a
steady rise from here would be healthy. Breaking above 820 and taking
out yesterday's high of 831 could become explosive to the upside.</p>

<p>It's interesting to see all three of these markets trading in a
textbook-perfect range. It's difficult to tell rather we'll move up or
down in the S&amp;P at the moment. If we are stuck in a trading range today,
which I think is the most likely to happen, then I'll be looking down
below.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Friday's strong rally with some volume seem to be following through as
of this morning. However, last Friday was options expiration day. So a
good proportion of that volume is expected to be due to that.
Additionally, the Asian market was down, except Japan and Australia,
last night. This is not a good sign. Hong Kong (-1.59%), Shanghai
(-3.67%), and Japan (+2.70%). This isn't good because it shows the world
players are not putting in their vote of confidence in this rally.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the hourly e-mini S&amp;P500 still haven't broken its downtrend
resistance from 11/04. I would like to see it breaks 814 and remain
above 803 as a confirmation to this rally. If ES can break 814/820, then
840 is just an earshot away and would be my first target. If it breaks
below 803, then 790 is the first target and then further breaking 780
would be diastrous.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_872" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>On a positive note, the US Dollar Index finally broke 87.50 as I was
waiting last Friday. This is a short term support level and a downtrend
in US Dollar is a good sign for the rally. This suggest that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/pre-market-analysis-for-november-21-2008/">sideline
money are moving into the US market</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, precious metals remain the best performers since last week. Gold
is still moving up with good momentum. ZG is now up 24.50 overnight to
816.20. The major 800 resistance didn't held it for long. If we can stay
above this 800 level, then this is a great sign of the strength to come
for Gold. Otherwise, breaking 800 to 793 or so is expected as a
retracement. Just so as long as Gold doesn't break 780, this precious
metals rally is still good.</p>

<p>The possible folding of Citigroup is creating another wave of panic on
the market today. As the second biggest bank in America, this is unlike
the collapse of Lehman, WaMu, Fannie and Freddie. While the previous
institutions are also gigantic financial institutions and an integral
part of the financial system, Citigroup is different because it's a part
of the daily lives of many Americans. While I am not an economist, but I
am a consumer. I <em>personally</em> feel this is psychologically a bigger
deal.</p>
<p>However, is this a time to panic? Perhaps. But from a trader's
standpoint, I think we would be a little too late now. In hindsight,
anyone would have wished to unload the financials back in 2007. But who
am I kidding, I definitely don't have that foresight.</p>
<p>What I do notice though, is that the failed retest of \$10 for C last
Friday and this Monday was a pretty good sign that C is going down. A
failed retest of the \$8.5 level on Tuesday and Wednesday was a
confirmation. I tried to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-325/">short C</a> then but was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-350/">stopped out</a>.
Frankly, I didn't think it would be <em>this</em> bad (my target was \$7).</p>
<p>Since then, Citigroup and the market continued to decline at an
accelerated pace. Rather this is simply a case of correlation or
causality is unknown by me. It doesn't matter. The point is, even an
amateur like me saw C to be going down on Wednesday. Do you think the
professionals would have missed it? Wouldn't they know already C would
be <em>going down in flames</em>? And probably months ago too!</p>
<p>I think it's good to assume that the current panic on Citigroup trading
below the magical \$5 has been factored in the market already. So am I
saying we'll be making a reversal soon? Not really. C trading below \$5
is one thing, but there's also the bigger picture we should consider.
Would this trigger a new leg of this bear run due to a vicious spiral of
panic? Don't forget, we have recently <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-breakdown-of-a-major-multi-year-support-are-we-going-down-and-i-mean-really-down/">broken some multi-year
supports</a>. This leg of the market downturn <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/pre-market-analysis-for-november-21-2008/">still haven't eased off
yet</a>.</p>
<p>Yes we may be going down, but I believe the time for panic was over,
this is a time for finding values and positioning yourself for the
longer term (hey, it has to go up <em>some</em> time, right?). I wouldn't dare
short this market though, even a target of 600 on the S&amp;P is just 150
points away, but look at the S&amp;P chart on any time frame and you can see
the vast green pasture to the upside. The risk/reward potential just
isn't that good for a short here.</p>
<p>I believe I have learned my lesson. There is no profit in calling for
bottoms. I will wait for the market to play it out and watch the price
action for entries.</p>

<p>Option expiration Friday is finally here! After <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fslr-100-jan-09-70-put-1320/">yesterday's horrific
day</a>, everyone is expecting a reversal today. Indeed, the market
futures are up overnight. S&amp;P futures broke 780 overnight and is holding
at around 765. We are probably going to open with a gap up in the market
and make an intraday rally from there. However, I wouldn't be chasing
this rally just yet. As you can see from Figure 1, we are merely
retracing the recent plunge back to the downtrend from earlier in the
week. S&amp;P 500 at 780 will be a resistance for today. 750 will be its
support. At 765, notice that we have 15 more upside points versus 15
down. This is not a good risk/reward at all.</p>
<p>Based on the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/stock-move-estimation-expiration-day-based-on-option-prices/">option pricing estimation method</a>, the S&amp;P is expected
to move within 40 points today.</p>
<p>One indicator to watch for a rally with follow through is the US Dollar
Index. As <a href="http://www.billcara.com">Bill</a> opined (yes, I read his blog religiously), \$USD will
fall if the sideline money are moving into equity. That will be the
source of a good rally. From Figure 2 below, you can see that the US
Dollar Index has dropped a bit. Yet, it is holding on at the 200 hour
bar moving average and a minor support from the recent trend. I would
like to see it breaks below 87.5 and stays there for at least an hour
before proclaiming a hold-able rally.</p>

<p>Another item of note is the rise of the precious metals. Gold has broken
the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-out-of-a-month-long-trading-range-for-gold-and-silver/">month-long triangle</a> to the upside. That's a good sign. Figure 4
shows that it has broken its hourly resistance too. We'll see if gold
can hold that gain or would this be a fake breakout of the triangle.</p>
<p>I am leaning towards nibbling at the market today on the long side with
small positions. If we see confirmation, then add slowly to the bullish
positions.</p>
