<p>The retracement from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-recollection-of-my-analysis-for-buying-when-sp-broke-down-to-820-today/">yesterday's monster reversal</a> is in progress. I
intend to take a more hands-off approach now and not have to hug my
market screen all day. It's just a more practical approach in the long
run for me.</p>
<p>So here's my after-lunch review of the market. The expected retracement
is under way. We have tested 870 on the S&amp;P and bounced off. The support
test volume was normal, but still 1/3 of yesterday's volume at about the
price level. I doubt we will break below this 870 intraday low today.</p>
<p>In particular, the pre-11am move looked good because we managed to keep
the 880 level. 880 is important because it's the resistance on Wednesday
and the first support level from yesterday's close. I didn't expect it
to hold because yesterday's 95 point move was a bit over done (like
everything else these days).</p>
<p>Even if the market breaks lower from here, we still have my mental
supporting line of SPY \$86.5 (high of the 30 min with the 2nd highest
volume time slot yesterday) and the fibonacci 61.8% of \$85.82 on the
SPY.</p>
<p>I will probably be off for the rest of the day. I haven't sold anything
yet, since we are in a retracement mode and the test looks strong so
far. I'd rather <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">sell on strength as planned</a>. It looks like we will
zig zag up from here at least for a few days.</p>
<p>Today's close will provide a sign of what I'll do with my positions next
week.</p>

<p>Finally! I have been waiting for a bear market rally for weeks! I
decided to go <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">full long after the bounce from 820 today</a>. Refer to
that post for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">details of my entries</a>. In this post, I would like to discuss why the 820 bounce
gave me the confidence in going all in despite widespread fear and the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/covered-slw-fro-and-wfc-short-puts/">many failed attempts</a> myself.</p>
<p>A quick recap of the past week's action. After the failed rally attempt
from 10/28 to 11/04, the market has been brutal to say the least. Any
strength failed to stir enthusiasm and has bled down slowly. The market
drifted down lower on little volume day after day. If I were to describe
the market, I'd say it looked like the last moment of a dying man. This
lack of will to move has certainly killed many bulls. I was one of them.
I have been stopped out a few times trying to catch this falling knife
(more like a grind). I even prepared to exit the last of my holdings if
we do break down from this point.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the day, the market looked like it's going to be
another down drift today. But being very near the 10/10 bottom already,
I know things are going to move one way or the other before the options
expiry next week. And since the Max Pain for the index options are at
least 10% higher, I am still looking for a reversal soon.</p>
<p>I mentally noted S&amp;P at 845 is an important level. It was the low of the
10/28 big rally day. The market skid on the 845 level all morning with
little volume. That was good because it is testing a support on low
volume. I had thought we may bounce from there.</p>
<p>Then I went to lunch just before noon.</p>
<p>When I got back after 1pm, the market has already broken down. However,
there are several bullish indication I noticed.</p>
<ol>
<li>the break down volume is higher than the previous bar (Figure 1),
    but it's still relatively low. Which means we don't have panic
    selling yet.</li>
<li>both the TICK and Advance-Decline line moving averages (Figure 2)
    are relatively healthy for such an important drop. Indicating no
    broad selling.</li>
<li>notice the unusual V shape for the TICK (Figure 2)? We even reached
    a new multi-day low of -1666. Yet #1 and #2 contradicts this
    seemingly panic selling, so this depression in price looked
    artificial to me</li>
</ol>
<p>Like how the recent rally attempts lacked enthusiasm, this break of 845
and test of 820 looked like it lacked enthusiasm too. Given that this is
such a major support level, odds are that we will bounce from here at
least for intraday. That is when I made my entry.</p>
<p></p>
Before 2pm, we broke 850, the low of yesterday, with the highest 30 min
volume of the week. That is when the rally looked strong to me and my
doubt of a bull trap eased. Frankly, I had some tight mental stops and
prepared to jump if things deteriorate like the many times before.</p>
<p>The day continued strong with price and volume confirmation. We closed
at the high with significant volume. We even reached 700 million volume
on SPY, a first since 10/16. I believe an intermediate bottom has been
set so I'll be looking at a longer timeframe (days) for my long
positions now.</p>
<p>First expected resistance from this move is 980 on the S&amp;P from the
trendline (Figure 1, right). Target is at least the 50 dma, we just
haven't touched it for 2 months. This is as good a time as ever to give
it a run for it.</p>
<p>Today is a great example of the need for critical thinking with a clear
head in light of a lot of pressure and past emotion. The beaten account,
the grim market movement, and the many stopped out trades has nearly
made me walk away for the week. But I remained focus on the market and
made my decision based on the price action.</p>
<p>Despite renewed optimism, I will continue to practice <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">prudent risk
management</a> and to eventually pocket at least most of the profit from
today, if not more.</p>

<p>The market broke my intraday support line today (pink line, first
graph). What appeared to be a good Monday turned out to be very
disappointing. I cleared the last of my short puts (i.e. long) about 5
seconds before the close when the market gained some footing. These
plays are purely for risk management purposes, each individual stock
looks ok to me to be accumulating at this level. But I'm in for the
swing trade and it haven't worked out. So I'm selling them all mainly
because the overall market looks weak.</p>
<p>To illustrate, today's intraday market data looked particularly bad. I
thought the market would turnaround after the TICK retested a -1200 low
for the day at noon on lower price, but the price continued to drift
down afterward. Then the 2pm rally didn't even break 930 (resistance
from yesterday) too. That was the last draw for me and I decided to exit
all risky positions from then on to minimize my risk. So I covered all
my options into the close.</p>
<p>The first of which was Dec SLW 5 put at 15:48 for \$1.70, which I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-3-slw-100-dec-08-5-put-155/">bought at \$1.55</a>. I still have my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-166-slw882-limit/">166 shares of SLW</a>, so it's an
obvious choice for me to unload the options. I don't want to be too
heavy on precious metal for now. SLW is still holding the \$3.4 level
and marked a higher low in the afternoon. So it's actually looking good.</p>

<p>Next I sold FRO at 15:59:27. The low of today looks like a test of a
daily trendline, pink line below on the right daily graph (Update: I
forgot to attach the graph. I added it a day later below). I normally
would have only sold if it breaks it, but again, the market looks bad.
So a retest of \$30 (highest volume in recent months) seems possible. I
covered the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fro-100-nov-08-40-put-790/">FRO short puts bought at \$7.90</a> for \$8.00. On another
note, I mistakenly placed a sell order on the put rather than a buy (to
cover) at \$8.10. So I quickly covered that accidental trade at \$8.30
regardless of that fact that FRO was moving up at that time. I've
learned my lesson in accidental orders and would cover immediately
regardless. I won't try to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-58-caf-2889-limit/">convince myself like my CAF trade</a>.</p>

<p>I covered my Nov <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-wfc-100-nov-08-31-put-360/">WFC short put bought at \$3.60</a> for \$3.00 at
15:59:55. Fee \$7.50.</p>
<p>I almost didn't want to give up my WFC position. It was the strongest
and the one most profitable of my Friday's swing trades. In particular,
last Friday's turnaround has by far the most volume in several months.
The \$28.0 support looks almost impenetrable. Indeed, today's low of
\$28.04 looks safe and we only tested it at very low volume. Indeed, I
really don't think we'll see this low again in the short term. Looking
at this more carefully now, maybe I should leave it open ... Oh well, I
can always get back in.</p>

<p>Wrote a put on Nov WFC strike 31 for \$3.60. Fee \$7.5 as usual for
options. WFC tested the critical \$27 support level today with a gap
down. The price gradually recovered with increasing volume. On the daily
chart, the overarching trend is still up from the 200 dma. But there's
some wild swings over the last few months, including the capitulation
this week from \$35 to \$27. We have tested the \$27 level today with
strong intraday action.</p>
<p>In particular, the S&amp;P is holding on the 910-915 level. In particular,
the 3:15pm test of 915 occurred at the all-day TICK low. Note the middle
graph of the NYSE TICK, we bounced at 915 right when the TICK reached a
new intraday low. This is a significant show of strength and it leads me
to believe the retracement from the rally has ended. We'll probably be
continuing the uptrend next week.</p>

<p>Upside: As explained above, looks like a rally in the broad market. The
financials should be winners since they dropped the most and this is a
bear rally. WFC is a strong contender in the financials, so I picked it
to ride this wave. Bought this mostly based on the technical analysis,
the \$27 test looked good.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$31.3, top of the gap down open from yesterday.</p>
<p>Downside: Stock tanked in last 3 days, from \$35 to \$27.</p>
<p>Support: \$27.</p>
<p>Bottom line: I'm just choosing to ride the strongest bull I could find
in an expected rally. I chose the 31 strike because of the gap down open
(\$31.3 - \$31.0) yesterday. We should fill it if this were to go up.
WFC was just below \$28 when I bought this, it has closed at \$29.50 on
a multi-day 15 min high volume. This is a short term play only, I'll let
it go when everyone else are smiling next week or two.</p>
