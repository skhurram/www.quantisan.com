            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After a steady decline for more than a week, Thursday and Friday's
market action were marked by the dramatic V-shaped bounces on both days.
From the hourly chart on Figure 1, we see that the end-of-day up volumes
were strong for either day. In fact, the average volume has been
increasing on this latest downtrend.</p>
<p>Over at the daily chart to the right of Figure 1, both the MACD and CO
are holding above their zero-level and looks as though they've started
to turn upward from those bounces.</p>
<p>However, it's interesting that we've closed just below the 850 pivot for
this long weekend and prior to the Obama inauguration. So we aren't
cleared of the water yet.</p>
<p>Next we look at the price pattern in Figure 2. Note that we have not
closed below the 830 support since December 1st. On the other hand,
we're about to test the 860-870 resistances. Those will be the levels to
watch for a confirmation to this rally. If we can break 860-870 on the
S&amp;P500, then 930 will be my first target based on the channel in Figure
2.</p>
<p>However, if we break below 830, 750 will be the first target. Based on
my indicators, I'd say we're more likely to see 930 first.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market tanked today after the holiday rally. The first 30 minute
today tagged the day as a down day. We started with a gap down, along
with the TICK sliding downward all morning. The real confirmation came
just before noon when the TICK broke above 1000 but the S&amp;P 500 failed
to break the 920 resistance. I knew we weren't going to close the gap
once the writing was on the wall.</p>

<p>Over the longer term, it's interesting to note that we tested the
November 28 high today. Based on the higher volume (versus Nov 28), it
seems we'll be able to break below it in the coming days. If that
happens, I'm staring right at 820 or so, around the middle of my down
channel and the 11/21 high as my target.</p>
<p>If we can bounce back from here though, I'm looking at the 11/04 low of
about 970 as my target.</p>

<p>What leads me to believe we're more likely to head lower at this point
is the obvious double top with negative divergences on the indicators
(figure below, pink trend line, lower right). We'll see how the market
performs tomorrow around this critical 900 level.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm technically still on holiday until January 12, so I'll keep my posts
short. I almost didn't want to write at all, but I feel that recent
market action has been noteworthy. So here it is.</p>
<p>The Christmas/New Year week has been nothing but up with next to nothing
volume in the markets. However, we have finally broken our recent
downtrend from October. See Figure 1. The next obvious target is 1000 on
the S&amp;P. However, because of the holiday low volume, I wouldn't bet my
farm on this move. Furthermore, on both of these breakout days in the
past 2 days, we have significant end-of-day sell-offs, see Figure 2.</p>
<p>In addition, the indicators are showing signs of weakness. However, that
can be explained by my use of volume weighted indicators. This
low-volume holiday week upmove would no doubt be read as weak by my
indicators.</p>
<p>All in all, I would just intrepret last week's action as noise in
general. The breakout confirmation should happen early next week. And
it's an obvious one at that, we'll just need to see if we can hold above
the channel.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've nearly pulled the trigger today on adding some shorts. Then I
decided against it because there's no action in the market and no good
confirmation. My 50% long, 25% short, and 25% cash distribution seems
alright for now. But Figure 1 below leads me to want to add more to the
short side.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 1, the market is still clearly in a downtrend.
Moreover, we are at the top end of the channel. So shorting at this
point has a good risk/reward ratio.</p>

<p>In particular, Goldman Sachs in Figure 2 seems like a decent play.</p>

<p>But as I was saying, I'd rather wait for GS to break the triangle first
before making a move. With the current market, it's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/auto-bailout-shakeout-december-13-2008/">better to be late
than early</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>To bail. Not to bail. To bail. Not to bail. Friday's market gapped down
big time on news the bailout failed to pass the senate on Thursday
night. Then just hours later, rumours were surfacing about the White
House stepping in with the TARP money. As of Saturday, FP headline reads
White House holds off on auto bailout.</p>
<p>Since I'm no economist, I am not going to discuss about the auto bailout
here. What matters to me is the market. As I was saying, the market
gapped down Friday morning and even touched 851 in the first few
minutes. However, it hacked its way back up to close positive at 879.73.</p>
<p>We managed to hold this critical 850 support level as I noted in
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/post-market-analysis-december-11-2008/">Thursday's post-market analysis</a>. However, I wouldn't want to add to
the longs at this point because both of my uptrend channels have been
broken. I feel that at this point, it is safer to watch and be more late
into a trend than usual.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to see the S&amp;P 500's behaviour around 860 or
900 (Figure 2), which ever comes first, before adding to my existing
positions.</p>

<p>On a more personal note, my stops for DRYS and SKF were triggered on
Friday.</p>
<p>On December 12, 2008 8:30:32 AM, my -\$1.0 trailing stop for DRYS were
triggered (stop at \$7.90) and my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-200-drys-533/">last 100 shares</a> were sold for a
basement price of \$7.34. I have definitely been a victim by the market
makers gunning for stops. As DRYS pushed higher throughout the day and
closed at \$9.37 on Friday.</p>
<p>As I'm actually away on a trip for these few weeks, I don't think I'll
re-enter DRYS until it clears the resistance at \$12. I simply cannot
watch it as close as I would like.</p>
<p>In any case, I already unloaded half my position <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-drys-111103/">previously at
\$11.11</a>. So although I feel I've been ripped off with my stop, I
believe this is overall still a good trade because I unloaded on
strength and have set a reasonable (using my channel) stop just in case
it turns back down on me while I'm away.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_973" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="DryShips Inc."]<img alt="DryShips Inc." src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/2008-12-14-dys.png" title="2008-12-14-drys" />[/caption]</p>
<p>My Ultrashort Financials (SKF) stop was triggered on Friday too. This
one I am a little dumbfounded. I have set my trailing stop at -\$17 on
the mark for SKF. The stop price of \$124 was triggered and my 7 shares
were sold for \$124.09. Having <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-7-skf-12883/">bought at \$128.83 the previous day</a>,
this is a small loss.</p>
<p>Notice that giant opening spike in the chart below? This is yet another
example of the market makers gunning for the stops. I believe I should
have set a hard stop instead for this one since I'm using it as a hedge.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_974" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>This is still a trader's market. Since I'm away oversea, I can't manage
my account as effective as I would have liked. Setting the trailing
stops was a safety measure. Although they worked against me this time, I
still think it was a good decision given my circumstances.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am at 50% longs now with no hedge (not good). My other 50% is
in cash. My primary short term goal now is to seek out a good short
entry to hedge my longs. I don't think I have the guts to add anymore
longs until I see more strength in this rally.</p> </div>

and closed at 873. We just broke below my intermediate term channel
today. We might test 850 at this point. Breaking below 850 will be an
obvious sign of an end to this current rally. I have tightened <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-drys-111103/">my stop
on DRYS</a> today since I don't intend to hold it through thick and thin.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I can't help but noticed that we're still within the
downtrend started on October 3. This is yet another reason why the
current rally hasn't really caught on yet. There are still many people
wisely waiting on the sideline. Even I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-drys-111103/">trimmed my longs</a> and taking on a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-7-skf-12883/">hedge in the ultrashort financials</a>.</p>
