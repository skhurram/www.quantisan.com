            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>It seems to me that the popular trading blogs have one thing in common.
They all make some form of forecasts about the market, or even better,
calling out to a particular stock or currency pair. My guess is that
there's a lot more people looking for trading ideas for quick profits
than actually interested in the mundane mechanics of trading. Well, that
and because of the fact that some of these blogs are written by
respectable professionals that do provide good insights (my
recommendations are linked to in my blogroll, near bottom of the sidebar
to the right). I used to publish my predictions on the market on a
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/weekly-review/">frequent basis</a>. It was my way of taking notes and keeping record for
the week or month. Ever since my embarrassing, and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-errors-lessons-being-long-just-before-the-october-2008-crash/">costly</a>, attempt
to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-sign-this-financial-bloodbath-is-ending-soon/">call for the bottom in October 2008,</a> I have learned to keep my
views to myself for the following reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>I suck at forecasting, terribly.</li>
<li>I wouldn't want anyone to trade on my guesses.</li>
<li>There are plenty of other, much wiser, traders posting their views
    online.</li>
<li>I changed my strategy by trading on reactions and not predictions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point #4 is what I'd like to discuss in this post. The main problem I
have with making forecasts is that I get stuck to one perspective. Say
if after a weekend analyzing session, I conclude that the market is up
for next week. I would keep looking for opportunities to go long in the
market the following week. That works well if I am right. Yet, as I
always say, I am wrong just as often as anyone. So the chance of success
is at best 50-50. On an equal chance that if I am wrong. I lose not once
but twice. First from being in the wrong side of the price move. Second
from missing that opposite and correct move. As such, I have since
adapted to a reactive <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">trading strategy</a> rather than a predictive one.
Essentially, I analyze the markets to come up with conditions for
different scenarios (usually just three cases: up, down, and no idea)
that will play out. For example, if <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-gbpjpy-145-24-stop-144-70-target-148/">GBP/JPY is above 144.50, I go
long</a>. One of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/">trading skills</a> I am still struggling to execute
consistently is to be deliberately one step slower than most people on
entering a trade. Being reactive is simplistically being a step slower
than everyone to ride an obvious setup. It goes like this ideally. When
the writings are on the wall and more aggressive traders have taken
their position, I wait even more. Then once those trades are still left
standing (i.e. not stopped out), that's when I would strike. On the
other hand, if the signs are not clear as crystal, I need to have the
discipline to step to the sideline. This strategy has been very useful
to me as I have recorded some <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/good-trade/">good trades</a> because of it. My ideal
strategy certainly is less glamourous than a buy low, sell high motto.
Yet, having been through a few too many ups and downs in my account over
the years, I have learned to appreciate the art of not gunning for every
penny out there but aiming to keep every penny in my pocket. Much like
how you would survive in a battle, the secret is to not be the first one
out the line and then only go for the easy kills. Cowardly, yes. But
unlike war, being brave in trading does not earn you any medal.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After watching the videos below, and from months of observation of this
latest global financial debacle, I am suddenly awashed with a feeling of
hopelessly powerless to this gross unfairness. In which the average,
hard working citizens are pouring money into the pockets of the filthy
and uber rich. If you don't know what I'm talking about here, watch the
video attached below for the tip of the ice berg in this on-going
problem. While Goldman is arguably the best at "legalized stealing" from
the moms and pops, they aren't the only crook on the block. Governments
around the world (not just the U.S.) were handing out money publicly
left and right in the past few months. And many still are. The whole
system is rigged as <a href="http://www.caracommunity.com">Bill Cara</a> has opined countless times in the last
few years. Bill's ingenious move to relocate his operation to the
Bahamas is only starting to shine in these months (to me). In addition
to voting with your ballot (which is useless if the whole system is
rigged), we can vote with our tax money by relocating our financial
operation. However, for those of us that still rely on a day job, this
is not an option. The best I can do right now is to become adequate with
managing our own money instead of depending on the financial salesmen.
This doesn't seem enough for me as the balance of power appears to be
getting worse by the day. Our government grossly tax us on one hand and
hand them out to the rich and well connected in the other. What have
others done/plan to do with regard to this unfair trap us working bees
are stuck in? The first video is Ratigan explaining how Goldman Sachs
made \$3 billions in 3 months (tipped by Stop Investing blog). The
second video is an interview with Michael Moore and Ratigan about where
all these loots are going now.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market made a new high for the year on Friday. There's no doubt that
the current trend is very bullish with the recent relentless climb since
March. See Figure 1.</p>
<p>However, why was 1025 on the S&amp;P500 (for example) so hard to break?
Since the market doesn't operate in a vacuum. Here's a look at S&amp;P500
ETF (SPY) v. the U.S. dollar (Figure 2) and v. Gold (Figure 3) for some
insights.</p>
<p>To invest in the U.S. market is a bet on the U.S. market (well
obviously) as well as the U.S. dollar. Because we're trading with U.S.
dollar in the U.S. market, its fluctuation will affect your return too.
Figure 2 is a chart of SPY divided by the U.S. dollar index (an
aggregate of the U.S. dollar v. other major currencies). In effect, it's
a normalized SPY chart with regards to the global currencies (and thus,
more or less the economies). As you can see, we just broke through a
long term resistance at 1.30 but is testing a Fibonacci level.</p>
<p>Similarly, the value of Gold is often used as a metric for currencies.
i.e. how much money is actually worth. Figure 3 is a chart of SPY
divided by the price of Gold. In effect, a normalized SPY chart with
regards to the real value of the U.S. dollar (since price of Gold is in
U.S. dollar).</p>
<p>Figure 3 is more telling. Although we've been moving higher and higher
in the raw SPY, you can clearly see that SPY/\$GOLD has been hitting a
ceiling since July. In other words, the market is going up because the
value of U.S. dollar is going down versus the companies these equities
represent.</p>
<p>While there's been much <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32506152/ns/business-stocks_and_economy/">talk of economic recovery</a> and a new <a href="http://online.barrons.com/article/SB125089288451150335.html">bull
market</a> is already with us, I still am not convinced just yet. True,
the bears might be MIA. But all signs say that this bull we're seeing is
standing on thin ice.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>One of the earlier popular post on this site is my view on the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tested-the-pre-2000-tech-bubble-14-year-old-trendline-last-week/">pre-tech-bubble trendline from before year 2000</a>. However, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/20-year-sp-500-trendline-actually-broken-months-ago/">that
trendline was broken in October 2008</a> as I've noted.</p>
<p>Since the recent actions in the market has often been compared with the
Great Depression, I've decided to chart S&amp;P500 all the way back to that
era. See the monthly chart of Figure 1 below from 1928 to today for the
S&amp;P500.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1677" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="S&amp;P 500 Index"][<img alt="S&amp;P 500 Index" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/2009-08-07-spx.png" title="2009-08-07-SPX" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>First of all, as evident in Figure 1, the market dropped a lot more in
1929-1932 than what we've been seeing in 2008-2009 so far.</p>
<p>Secondly, notice the channel bounded by the two outer white lines? The
channel drawn have been bounding the market pretty well. Moreover, if we
compare the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States">list of recessions in the U.S.</a>with Figure 1, you can see
that as a rule of thumb, the economy is in boom if the market is in the
upper half of the channel, and the economy is struggling if the market
is in the lower half of the channel. The middle white line marks the
middle of the channel for easier observation.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the follow years are in the upper range, with some
rounding:</p>
<ol>
<li>1932-1940, 8 years</li>
<li>1954-1973, 19 years</li>
<li>1986-2008, 22 years</li>
</ol>
<p>and the follow years are in the lower range:</p>
<ol>
<li>1940-1954, 14 years</li>
<li>1973-1986, 13 years</li>
<li>2008-????</li>
</ol>
<p>Since my knowledge on modern history is abysmal, I can't comment on what
happened in these eras to verify this superficial categorization. This
is certainly worth further researching.</p>
<p></p>
Thirdly, and this one is a positive remark, is that the RSI has only
gone below 25 three times in the last 80 years, and the two times that
it occurred in the past (1932, 1974), it is when the market/economy has
reached a major bottom.</p>
<p>Now, zooming to the current few years in Figure 2. You can see that
we've managed to push above the 200 month moving average this month.
That isn't much on its own, the challenge now is to see if we can stay
above it (1000 on the S&amp;P500) by end of August.</p>
