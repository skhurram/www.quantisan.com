<p>The market broke my intraday support line today (pink line, first
graph). What appeared to be a good Monday turned out to be very
disappointing. I cleared the last of my short puts (i.e. long) about 5
seconds before the close when the market gained some footing. These
plays are purely for risk management purposes, each individual stock
looks ok to me to be accumulating at this level. But I'm in for the
swing trade and it haven't worked out. So I'm selling them all mainly
because the overall market looks weak.</p>
<p>To illustrate, today's intraday market data looked particularly bad. I
thought the market would turnaround after the TICK retested a -1200 low
for the day at noon on lower price, but the price continued to drift
down afterward. Then the 2pm rally didn't even break 930 (resistance
from yesterday) too. That was the last draw for me and I decided to exit
all risky positions from then on to minimize my risk. So I covered all
my options into the close.</p>
<p>The first of which was Dec SLW 5 put at 15:48 for \$1.70, which I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-3-slw-100-dec-08-5-put-155/">bought at \$1.55</a>. I still have my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-166-slw882-limit/">166 shares of SLW</a>, so it's an
obvious choice for me to unload the options. I don't want to be too
heavy on precious metal for now. SLW is still holding the \$3.4 level
and marked a higher low in the afternoon. So it's actually looking good.</p>

<p>Next I sold FRO at 15:59:27. The low of today looks like a test of a
daily trendline, pink line below on the right daily graph (Update: I
forgot to attach the graph. I added it a day later below). I normally
would have only sold if it breaks it, but again, the market looks bad.
So a retest of \$30 (highest volume in recent months) seems possible. I
covered the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-fro-100-nov-08-40-put-790/">FRO short puts bought at \$7.90</a> for \$8.00. On another
note, I mistakenly placed a sell order on the put rather than a buy (to
cover) at \$8.10. So I quickly covered that accidental trade at \$8.30
regardless of that fact that FRO was moving up at that time. I've
learned my lesson in accidental orders and would cover immediately
regardless. I won't try to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-58-caf-2889-limit/">convince myself like my CAF trade</a>.</p>

<p>I covered my Nov <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-wfc-100-nov-08-31-put-360/">WFC short put bought at \$3.60</a> for \$3.00 at
15:59:55. Fee \$7.50.</p>
<p>I almost didn't want to give up my WFC position. It was the strongest
and the one most profitable of my Friday's swing trades. In particular,
last Friday's turnaround has by far the most volume in several months.
The \$28.0 support looks almost impenetrable. Indeed, today's low of
\$28.04 looks safe and we only tested it at very low volume. Indeed, I
really don't think we'll see this low again in the short term. Looking
at this more carefully now, maybe I should leave it open ... Oh well, I
can always get back in.</p>

<p>Wrote a put on Nov WFC strike 31 for \$3.60. Fee \$7.5 as usual for
options. WFC tested the critical \$27 support level today with a gap
down. The price gradually recovered with increasing volume. On the daily
chart, the overarching trend is still up from the 200 dma. But there's
some wild swings over the last few months, including the capitulation
this week from \$35 to \$27. We have tested the \$27 level today with
strong intraday action.</p>
<p>In particular, the S&amp;P is holding on the 910-915 level. In particular,
the 3:15pm test of 915 occurred at the all-day TICK low. Note the middle
graph of the NYSE TICK, we bounced at 915 right when the TICK reached a
new intraday low. This is a significant show of strength and it leads me
to believe the retracement from the rally has ended. We'll probably be
continuing the uptrend next week.</p>

<p>Upside: As explained above, looks like a rally in the broad market. The
financials should be winners since they dropped the most and this is a
bear rally. WFC is a strong contender in the financials, so I picked it
to ride this wave. Bought this mostly based on the technical analysis,
the \$27 test looked good.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$31.3, top of the gap down open from yesterday.</p>
<p>Downside: Stock tanked in last 3 days, from \$35 to \$27.</p>
<p>Support: \$27.</p>
<p>Bottom line: I'm just choosing to ride the strongest bull I could find
in an expected rally. I chose the 31 strike because of the gap down open
(\$31.3 - \$31.0) yesterday. We should fill it if this were to go up.
WFC was just below \$28 when I bought this, it has closed at \$29.50 on
a multi-day 15 min high volume. This is a short term play only, I'll let
it go when everyone else are smiling next week or two.</p>

<p>I looked at the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tested-the-pre-2000-tech-bubble-14-year-old-trendline-last-week/">20 year S&amp;P 500 monthly chart</a> last week and noted
that we're at an interesting junction in the market. Now that it's the
end of the month, I can say that we have successfully held that level
after all. The graph above is from MSN finance. It took me a while to
find a legible chart going back before the 87 crash.</p>
<p>Actually, what I have illustrated is<strong>technically wrong</strong>. I should use
a logarithmic scale instead because of the compounding effect of growth
in the economy. If we look at the chart on a logarithmic scale, we see
that we have just broken it in this year's market free fall (around
June). I guess that's another reason to the verocity of this move.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_560" align="aligncenter" width="499"

<p>However, it is still interesting to see that we're bouncing right on the
linear scaled chart. Even though it is technically wrong to use it on
such long term chart, technical analysis itself isn't an exact science
anyway. So I'm not dogmatic with the proper use of it. <strong>As long as it
works and within logic, then it's good</strong>!</p>
<p>Update Nov 20: We broke down a major 10-year support yesterday at 820 on

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The fundamental for \$1000+ Gold is certainly in place, like the free
money handout that's been going on in many countries and the global
financial panic. Conventional wisdom says in times of trouble, hoard as
much gold as you can. I still believe Gold and Silver will break their
previous highs from earlier this year.</p>
<p>Yet, I don't have a Swiss bank account to hoard physical gold nor have I
got the financial means to even purchase <a href="http://www.pmcg.com.au/">mint-backed gold
certificates</a>. I am merely a small time trader on the market. One rule
of the tradebook I learned by experience is that it's good to <strong>live by
an independent perspective on the market, but don't die by it</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at the gold and silver charts though, it is blatantly obvious
that we're in a severe downtrend lately, for whatever reasons. The small
rally this week may be tempting for some perma-bull or the
fundamentalists. But I wouldn't enter the commodities market at this
point without some price-volume confirmation.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we look at the gold chart. We see that the current rally is
probably a retracement. It has tested its resistance at 780 and backed
down already.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_537" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="Gold"][<img alt="Gold" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/2008-10-30-gold.jpg" title="2008-10-30-gold" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the silver camp is looking better. We are seeing a
positive divergence in both the RSI and MACD in the latest down leg.
This is caused by the more severe fall of silver since its high earlier.
The silver down leg hasn't had a chance to catch a breath like gold has.
In fact, I would watch for an upside break in Silver regardless of the
move in Gold. I don't know would this be possible and sustainable,
silver going up while gold going down.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_538" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="Silver"][<img alt="Silver" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/2008-10-30-silver.jpg" title="2008-10-30-silver" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Sometimes it's easy to forget that gold and silver are two commodities
with two different prices. That is because gold and silver price
correlation is very high and have generally moved together for many
fundamental reasons. However, there are periods of time when the
Gold/Silver ratio make drastic changes.</p>
<p>The G/S ratio has been around 55 - 65 in the past 5 years. G/S ratio
runs higher in times of trouble when people purchase gold as a safety
shelter to store value. In the tech bubble, G/S went above 80 around
2003. The highest in the past 40 year occured after the 1987 crash, in
1990 when G/S got to 100.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_539" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="Historical Gold/Silver Ratio (snatched from
www.gold-eagle.com)"][<img alt="Historical Gold/Silver Ratio" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/gsr-gm.gif" title="gsr-gm" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>While the absolute price of Gold and Silver has been counter-intuitive,
the G/S ratio picture still fits well with the norm. Notice the spike
starting in August 2008? When the financial troubles we're in now is
written all over the wall? (Actually, the writing on the wall appeared
late last year already, but that's another story.) The faster fall of
Silver lately could be explained with this. If that's the case, then
both Gold and Silver could continue its downtrend.</p>

ratio" src="http://traderpau.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/gold-silver.png" title="gold-silver" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>So what's my point in this post? I don't really have one. I am just
saying what's in my mind about Gold and Silver in this recent
counter-intuitive trend. In terms of the prices, I am still bullish on
gold and silver in the looong term. And definitely bearish in the short
term. When will they move up? I don't know, just observe the market. But
I see silver to have more upside if it were to go up. It could easily
creep up to \$12 from here.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>While I haven't written about my stance on the flood of bailouts, I have
been against it all along. Pouring tax payers' <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122540927284586151.html">money into a select few
elites</a> in the name of <em>helping</em> the economy has sank my respect for
the American government to a new low. This is just like the Bush's
Weapons of Mass Destruction lies and the subsequent Iraq invasion all
over again, only on an epic scale and the effect much more encompassing.
However, the situation have reached a new low. In today's news, there's
talk of banks asking for credit card debt forgiveness. They might as
well just hand out each American a million dollar cheque. Then watch the
American dollar become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar">Zimbobwe money</a> and plunge America back to the
Medieval era when people would barter for their goods. The sheer
stupidity of this move is below even that of Bush's intelligence! If
what the U.S.A. is doing lately isn't socialism, then I don't know what
is. That is one huge factor why I've been long gold and silver with my
accumulating position in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/slw/">SLW</a>. It looks as though we might be in for
a continued downtrend in precious metal prices. But sooner or later,
prices will reflect their true values. Update: The Big Picture made a
post about <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/10/moral-hazard-of.html">mortgage bailouts</a> today on the same issue. Barry puts the
issue of bailing out bad debts succinctly, "moral hazard not only
encourages recklessness, it leads to people looking to avoid
responsibility for bad decisions."</p> </div>

<p>I decided to look at the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-capitulation-under-way/">20-year monthly chart once again</a>. After all
said and done in this crazy October, look where we are now. Right back
to where we were, before the credit crunch, the housing bubble, the iraq
invasion, 9/11, the tech bubble, and the 1998 bear. Just look at the
trend line extrapolated from 1994 drawn above. Isn't it amazing!</p>
<p>On Saturday, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-volatile-week-and-no-sign-of-the-bull-yet/">I questioned our direction for next week</a> and noted its
significance. Looking at this chart, if we go down next week, then this
will very much be a new leg of a downtrend because of its significance.
We haven't broken this trendline in ... 14 years! <em>If</em> we do break this
supporting line, then I wouldn't be surprised if we go all the way down
to 650 on the S&amp;P, the 1995 congestion zone.</p>
<p>As of this writing on Sunday night, the morning Asian market looks
directionless at the open, Nikkei +0.4%, Hang Seng -1.6%.</p>
<p>I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/20-year-sp-500-trendline-actually-broken-months-ago/">review this chart again</a> this weekend when it's end of the
month.</p>
