            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>After a steady decline for more than a week, Thursday and Friday's
market action were marked by the dramatic V-shaped bounces on both days.
From the hourly chart on Figure 1, we see that the end-of-day up volumes
were strong for either day. In fact, the average volume has been
increasing on this latest downtrend.</p>
<p>Over at the daily chart to the right of Figure 1, both the MACD and CO
are holding above their zero-level and looks as though they've started
to turn upward from those bounces.</p>
<p>However, it's interesting that we've closed just below the 850 pivot for
this long weekend and prior to the Obama inauguration. So we aren't
cleared of the water yet.</p>
<p>Next we look at the price pattern in Figure 2. Note that we have not
closed below the 830 support since December 1st. On the other hand,
we're about to test the 860-870 resistances. Those will be the levels to
watch for a confirmation to this rally. If we can break 860-870 on the
S&amp;P500, then 930 will be my first target based on the channel in Figure
2.</p>
<p>However, if we break below 830, 750 will be the first target. Based on
my indicators, I'd say we're more likely to see 930 first.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The market tanked today after the holiday rally. The first 30 minute
today tagged the day as a down day. We started with a gap down, along
with the TICK sliding downward all morning. The real confirmation came
just before noon when the TICK broke above 1000 but the S&amp;P 500 failed
to break the 920 resistance. I knew we weren't going to close the gap
once the writing was on the wall.</p>

<p>Over the longer term, it's interesting to note that we tested the
November 28 high today. Based on the higher volume (versus Nov 28), it
seems we'll be able to break below it in the coming days. If that
happens, I'm staring right at 820 or so, around the middle of my down
channel and the 11/21 high as my target.</p>
<p>If we can bounce back from here though, I'm looking at the 11/04 low of
about 970 as my target.</p>

<p>What leads me to believe we're more likely to head lower at this point
is the obvious double top with negative divergences on the indicators
(figure below, pink trend line, lower right). We'll see how the market
performs tomorrow around this critical 900 level.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm technically still on holiday until January 12, so I'll keep my posts
short. I almost didn't want to write at all, but I feel that recent
market action has been noteworthy. So here it is.</p>
<p>The Christmas/New Year week has been nothing but up with next to nothing
volume in the markets. However, we have finally broken our recent
downtrend from October. See Figure 1. The next obvious target is 1000 on
the S&amp;P. However, because of the holiday low volume, I wouldn't bet my
farm on this move. Furthermore, on both of these breakout days in the
past 2 days, we have significant end-of-day sell-offs, see Figure 2.</p>
<p>In addition, the indicators are showing signs of weakness. However, that
can be explained by my use of volume weighted indicators. This
low-volume holiday week upmove would no doubt be read as weak by my
indicators.</p>
<p>All in all, I would just intrepret last week's action as noise in
general. The breakout confirmation should happen early next week. And
it's an obvious one at that, we'll just need to see if we can hold above
the channel.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I've nearly pulled the trigger today on adding some shorts. Then I
decided against it because there's no action in the market and no good
confirmation. My 50% long, 25% short, and 25% cash distribution seems
alright for now. But Figure 1 below leads me to want to add more to the
short side.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 1, the market is still clearly in a downtrend.
Moreover, we are at the top end of the channel. So shorting at this
point has a good risk/reward ratio.</p>

<p>In particular, Goldman Sachs in Figure 2 seems like a decent play.</p>

<p>But as I was saying, I'd rather wait for GS to break the triangle first
before making a move. With the current market, it's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/auto-bailout-shakeout-december-13-2008/">better to be late
than early</a>.</p> </div>
