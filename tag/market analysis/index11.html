<p>Another week has gone by and still no sign of the bull yet. Perhaps the
smart money have begun hoarding shares? Perhaps the market makers are
scheming for another run down? Who knows. It doesn't matter anymore. The
fact is, I don't think we'll know for certain if a rally has occurred
until it's staring us in the face. But that's fine. Don't try to pick
the bottom. With the VIX at a new high of 96.4 last week, we could face
another free-fall of prices on just a hiccup in the market.</p>

<p>On the intermediate term, I am still bullish on the overall market. I
see the market will be more likely to be much higher than lower by the
end of the year. I came to this conclusion from the observation of
prices and volume this past 2 weeks. I made a post about <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-sign-this-financial-bloodbath-is-ending-soon/">monitoring the
3 banks before the CDS settlement</a> for signs of trouble. Since then,
we continue to test the support on low volumes on the S&amp;P (see top
chart).</p>
<p>However, we're on to a fast down trend last week with increasing volume.
Next week would be interesting (which week isn't these days?) and Monday
should offer a sign of things to come. The indices have closed on a new
low this Friday. At this point, the bear is likely to make another dash.</p>
<p>Actually, I'd be more happy if we just get over with it and make a big
time plunge next week. It's certainly better in the long run than this
recent, prolonged, corpse-dragging process. That way, we can shake out
the recent, short-term bulls and clear an upward path with little
resistance.</p>
<p>As I've said, watch the action next week.</p>

<p>A great close today. Notice that we're testing the 910/920 (S&amp;P/SPY)
resistance with significant volume in the last hour of the day. The
volume is more than the level established at the resistance.</p>
<p>The same can be said of BAC and JPM. C's end-of-day volume didn't break
through. Recall that these are the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-sign-this-financial-bloodbath-is-ending-soon/">3 banks I said to watch for in last
week's CDS crisis</a>. In fact, Lehman's CDS settled without much
fanfare. See Lehman CDS settlement of \$5.2 billion.</p>
<p>I expect tomorow morning (was going to say 'day', but who knows these
days) to follow through with today's action. We'll see if we can close
the week higher for a triple-bottom, with 3 long tails, on the daily
chart. In particular, I'd like to see if we can break <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-down-of-this-weeks-trading-range/">above 940 for the
close as I have opined previously</a>.</p>

<p>After a couple of weeks of wild ups and downs, we've been stuck in a
trading range this week on low volume (relatively low based on recent
weeks, but about average on regular terms). But seeing today's
end-of-day weakness (testing low on huge volume), I expect the market to
break down tomorrow morning. However, what's more important is where the
bulk of the price will go, so watch the volume tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is like the calm before, yet another, storm. Not really much for me
to do now but just wait and see. If we can hold the 940 support level
(high of 10/10) on the S&amp;P this week, or scrape it on low volume, then
that would be a very good sign.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am going to stick my neck out and say we are bottoming these days.
Why? Here goes.</p>
<p>
In Bill Cara's commentary today, he opines about the [rationale for the
current market crash][] (not the one last week, but this week).

> Why the panic bail-outs? The answer lies in the \$55 trillion dollar
> Credit Default Swap market that is unraveling day to day. Banks and
> central banks are totally focused on the breaks to the credit ring
> when up to \$400 billion of Lehman Brothers CDS obligations come due
> in the next week, with nobody at the teller window to pay up. Lehman
> Brothers is, as you know, bankrupt.
> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><p>
What this means is that unspecified banks holding the Lehman CDS
derivatives will get nothing, and then they will be unable to meet
their obligations to other banks. At stake are the Money Market Funds
on deposit in these banks. The entire system could collapse, so banks
do not want to be in the position of lending to one another. The
credit market has failed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bill suggests that we look at the 3 biggest banks in the world (total
over 90% of CDS market) for the first signs of when the market will tank
further. Because, well... if they can't pull through this mess, we are
really doomed.</p>
<p></p>
So here's where my own analysis comes in. Besides Bill's rationale, we
know the current crisis is caused by the collapse of the financial
market. So I've been looking at the financial heavyweights in any case.</p>
<p>Enough talk, let's look at the market today. After the failed attempt of
a rally earlier this week, the market is widely expected to continue
spiral down. It has. And the media is certainly not short of fueling the
panic. See: Worries over economy spread; global markets sink and
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122411376471138395.html?mod=todays_us_nonsub_page_one">Economic Fears Reignite Market Slump</a>. However, <em>what everyone knows
isn't worth knowing</em>.</p>
<p>The only information traders should listen to though, is the price data.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_394" align="aligncenter" width="500"
caption="BAC, C, JPM, and S&amp;P 500"][<img alt="BAC, C, JPM, and S&amp;P

<p>As I was saying, based on yesterday's end-of-day move, the market is
expected to tank today, at least this morning. If we focus on the 3
banks, we can see they have broken yesterday's end-of-day low and are
testing the Monday lows. However, this is the key, their 15 min volume
on today's low is below yesterday's last 15 min when the prices dived.
All of their prices are testing their lows on lower volumes!</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>I believe the selling is drying up</strong>.</p>
<p>Does this mean we'll be shooting up from here? Perhaps. But this is a
very good sign. I would wait until the next significant daily move
(either up or down) and watch the quality of the action before making
any monetary committment in this crazy market.</p>

<p>The only thing for certain at this point in the market is that there're
a lot of uncertainties. Notice the several big swing days near the
October low but with open and close near each other (a.k.a. the doji's).
Are we at the bottom yet? I don't know. Have we started a rally attempt
this week? Definitely! Is it going to hold? My intuition says likely.</p>
<p>Why do I say that? Three reasons. Fundamentally, the joint effort by
world central banks to inject billions of dollars into the capital
market isn't going to be unnoticed. Secondly, the up days this week has
been marked by some strong late-day climb across the market. This
suggest the pros/smart money are buying. Thirdly, also notice the
significant volume at the doji last Friday, when the market reached a
new low. Subsequently, the decline in the last two days has been on much
lower, and declining volume.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the fear and panic are still very much alive.
Profit-taking will create some serious resistance going up. Also, the
market has been very irrational lately, so any fundamental or technical
analysis could very well be thrown out the window.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, I believe an intermediate term bull phrase is taking
shape, yet be very cautious in your approach and use a conservative risk
management approach. I am not going to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/4-errors-lessons-being-long-just-before-the-october-2008-crash/">repeat my errors from last
month</a> when I entered full long just before the biggest market crash

[![S&P 500 review][]][]
:   S&P 500 review

</div>

<p></p>
I have been waiting to go long in this bear market for a few weeks now,
hoping for a bottom soon (first of my errors).  Then on week of
September 29th, I decided to go all in (error #2).  S&amp;P closed at 1099
that Friday.  A week later, on October 10th, the Friday close of S&amp;P 500
was 899 points, and I am still left holding on (error #3).</p>
<p>Error #4 though, requires some explaination.  Simply put, I was not
reading the chart as I should have.  While both the price action and
contrarian sentiments were bullish, I totally missed out on a basic
technical analysis indicator ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â? the volume.  Looking at
the above chart, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to see that the first
downward break of the trendline in mid-September was confirmed with
volume.  The volume on that day (left blue arrow), and for that entire
week, is substantially higher than usual.  The subsequent mini rally
attempt before the next break has been marked with little volume.  This
suggests that market participants, particularly the longs, still
havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t flocked in yet.</p>
<p>Seeing that, I [should at least reduce my position size by exiting some
of my most weak positions][] (i.e. least profitable positions) before
the weekend.</p>
<p>While this is not my costliest lesson in trading, it illustrates some
very fundamental lessons which I should <strong>reiterate</strong>, because I should
have known better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Never try to pick the top or bottom.  Which I thought I learned from
    my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/futures/">futures trading</a> already.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/">Manage risk according to volatility</a>.</li>
<li>Exit at any cost if it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look right in a bear
    market.</li>
<li>DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get fixated on the individual stocks, look at
    the bigger picture.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
Actually, I think this all boils down to proper <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>.</p>
