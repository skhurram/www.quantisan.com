            <div class="article-content"> <p>We have touched the 800 point on the S&amp;P500 and bounced back as everyone
expected.  We are still within [last weekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s predicted
trading range between 750 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 800][].  Even though talks
of optimism are appearing, we still havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been able
to break the downtrend since October, see Figure 2.   In fact, I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-277-tck-487/">unloaded my TCK longs</a> just after the test of 800.  I am now focusing
on finding my best bets for the next leg up.</p>
<p>Rather than ending here as usual, I will analyze the various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GICS">GICS
sectors</a> to get a better view of the market.</p>

<p><strong>GICS SECTORS REVIEW</strong></p>
<p>Below are the 6-month, 1-month, and 1-week graphic comparison of the
performance of GICS10: energy (XLE), GICS15: materials (XLB), GICS20:
industrials (XLI), GICS25: consumer discretionary (XLY), GICS30:
consumer staples (XLP), GICS35: healthcare (XLV), GICS40: financial
(XLF), GICS45: technology (XLK), GICS:50 telecommunication (IYZ), and
GICS55: utilities (XLU).</p>
<p>Evidently, the ball is with the financials for the past few months. 
They have led the turn down (6-month chart) and also the bounce (1-month
chart).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Financial again were leading the pack in the rally. 
However, Energy kept the ball rolling on Thursday while the Financial
were drifting down.  At the other end of the spectrum, Healthcare and
Utilities are against the flow as usual.</p>

<p>In terms of guessing whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to come next week. 
LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s take a closer look at the financial.  As you can
see, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re hanging by a tread right at the support at
the moment.  So <strong>if XLF is to break this support here,
itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to take the whole market with it</strong>.  Then,
weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be breaking the 750 support for the S&amp;P 500 and
go back to the 600ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s range as IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve
been saying for the past 2 weeks.  This is definitely one scenario which
I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like it to happen.  As always,
letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s see how the market acts next week and go with the
flow.  Again, watch the 750 and 800 zones.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>We touched 800 on the S&amp;P 500 again yesterday morning. However, on
significantly less volume (almost half) this time... Even though we have
broken the 40 day EMA in the past couple of days, we closed right at it
yesterday, see Figure 1.</p>
<p>The Asian markets were mixed last night and Gold is still holding on to
the 950 level. Things don't look good for today.</p>
<p>The way back to 780 seem very free of resistance, isn't it? Thus, I
would set my resistance at 780 and support at 800 for today. Anything
beyond those bounds should be watched closely.</p>
<p>As usual, watch the market price in the first 30 minute as an indicator
as part of today's trading plan.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Last week's market reacted as planned. We held the S&amp;P500 680 support
level on Monday and shot up from there throughout the week. This <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-weekly-review-march-7-2009/">750 -
800 level as discussed before</a> could form a trading range for the next
few days. However, note that both the S&amp;P index and Goldman Sachs (GS)
are testing the downtrend resistance at 800 and 100 respectively. GS in
particular failed to reach 100 again on declining daily volume. This is
a pretty bad sign. (JPM, C, and BAC looks similar to GS, in that they
are showing a short term double top)</p>
<p>If we fail to keep this momentum going up, I see a pullback to 720 to be
very possible. And if we're to fail to keep the 720 support, 670 would
be next, and then 600 as I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-weekly-review-march-7-2009/">suggested in last week's review</a>.</p>

indicator is because we're, obviously, in a financial crisis, so like a

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is my first post in over a month. I have finally settled in my new
place and will get back into the game gradually. I'll start by
introducing this market weekly review which I intend to do on a weekly
basis.</p>
<p>S&amp;P500 was holding on to the 800 level when I left (Jan 30), now it's
struggling to keep 670. Needless to say, the month of February has been
yet another bloodbath in the markets. Long story short, let's dive
straight into the analysis.</p>
<p>As evident in Figure 1, we have started a nosedive since breaking below
800. Of special note is that the weekly volume has been increasing very
orderly as we're moving downward.</p>
<p>From Figure 2, we are approaching the bottom of the downward channel
which I've charted back in January. At the time, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/weekly-market-review-january-18-2009/">I thought we'd be
breaking higher</a>, not lower. Incredibly though, I did say that if we
break below 830, we'll be seeing 750. That was pretty much what happened
near the end of February. So using this channel again, it's obvious that
if we don't hold this 680 level, 600 would be the next target.</p>
<p>In addition to the gloomy picture of Figure 1 as discussed, Figure 3
shows the VIX as we broke below 700 this week. This is yet another bad
picture we're seeing. The VIX has been holding well below 50 even when
we have broken below this critical level. This can mean that there's
still no panic yet. Coupling this with the price/volume picture of
Figure 1, I'd say this recent down draft is a measured selloff rather
than panic selling. Technically, we won't be getting any decent rally
until emotions have peaked on the way down. So my estimate for now is
that we'll be heading lower still.</p>
<p>On the other hand, my directional guess has never been any good. But my
pivot and target estimates are. So I'll say this here, <strong>if we go below
680, 600 is my conservative target</strong>. <strong>If we can hold this level, 750
to 800 looks like a good congestion zone to revisit.</strong></p>
