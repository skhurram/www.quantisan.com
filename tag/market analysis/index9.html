<p>After breaking the 820 support on the S&amp;P 500 2 days ago, the market
dived into the abyss today as I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/another-breakdown-of-a-major-multi-year-support-are-we-going-down-and-i-mean-really-down/">suggested this morning</a>. Frankly, the
mid-day looked alright and I thought we wouldn't go down anymore.</p>
<p>Turns out I was wrong (I stayed on sideline as planned). The market
capitulated in the last hour. In particular, Citigroup sank to \$4.71.
My <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-325/">short call at \$8.20</a> would have made a killing had I not get
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-350/">stopped out</a>. Oh well, I'm not complaining. Although my portfolio is
way down, I am just glad that I managed my risk and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-1-abb-100-nov-08-125-put-195/">covered all my
short puts</a> a couple of days ago. In hindsight though, I really should
have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-c-100-nov-08-5-call-325/">hedged my position</a> more eagerly.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to this entry. Why? After failing to pick the bottom so
many times, why the heck am I entering now? (This is going in my rule
book, <strong>no picking top/bottom</strong>)</p>
<p>Do I think this is the bottom for FSLR? I don't know. Why did I enter
this trade? Because if offers good risk/reward and probability.</p>
<p>Upside: January 2009 expiry date with 50% probability of expiry for this
70 strike. Support is \$75 for FSLR set in 2007 but we never even came
close to it in this historic downleg in the market. Today marked a new
low of \$86. Thus, my 70 strike is a stink bid. And being paid \$13.20
for this stink bid? I compared this risk/reward to a few strong
companies I liked and this OTM put price is the highest (since I'm
shorting).</p>
<p>Resistance: \$100. But I don't really care since this is a stink bid and
I have limited upside.</p>
<p>Downside: If we do break \$75, then all hell breaks lose in this. We are
still in a severe and monumental market crash. I don't have cash to buy
the shares if this is put to me in January.</p>
<p>Support: \$75.</p>
<p>Bottom line: This is a high probability trade. Stop is just below \$75.</p>
<p>
**Update:** I am going to liquidate this position tomorrow. Bill from
[BillCara.com kindly shared his insight][] on this trade.

I also didn't think this thoroughly myself. I simply cannot stomach the
potential drawdown in FSLR. Even my own trendline analysis shows it can
go to \$80 on this down run. I should wait for confirmations of strength
before heading in at this point.

<p>The 820 S&amp;P 500 level was a major 10-year support. We broke that clean
yesterday and passed the psychological 800 level. This is ugly to say
the least. A target for this downmove is about 770, possibly 680 as
indicated on Figure 1.</p>
<p>If we're to make a turnaround for a fail of this support test, a clean
break of the upper trendline on Figure 2 today or tomorrow would be
great news. With options expiration this Friday, volatility is going to
be higher, so it will be hard to distinguish simple volatility,
retracement, or real rebounds. I think the hourly trendline in Figure 2
is a good starting point as it has worked throughout the week in this
down leg.</p>
<p>This isn't the end of the world by all account. Don't let fear or your
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">hope for a rally</a> impede your trading. This is as good as time as
ever to remind yourself to <strong>watch the price action and make objective
decisions</strong>.</p>
<p>I am not going to trade this crazy market for short term swings.
Instead, I'll be looking for values and good price actions to position
myself in this few days for the next few months.</p>

<p>I recall somebody said that the opening is a good indication of retail
trader (the non-pros) emotions. After <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-market-crashed-friday-again-now-what/">Friday's last minute 40 point
drop on the S&amp;P</a>, things couldn't be more orderly this morning. Yes,
the opening volume is high, but it's still below that of most of the
days last week. Considering that we just witnessed a possible failed
rally on Friday, the negativity is expected. So we're continuing to
drift downward. That is expected too.</p>
<p>But with the media's doom and gloom without offering anything new over
the weekend, I had expected something worse. For example, we just broken
the 855 support (the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">61.8% fibo retracement target I mentioned</a>) as
I'm writing but the fall stopped at 850. There're a lot of <strong>hessitation
in the selling</strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all these testings of support seem like a test of
conviction to me. They look too textbook perfect to be real. I don't
know, perhaps this is the real deal and the inevitable fall is only
being held up by people like me.</p>
<p>In any case, since my prices are still well above my stops, I am not
selling on this low volume test of support just yet. There's just too
much fear going around this morning to be selling. I'd rather wait til
the afternoon. The closing hour today would be a good tell if this bear
rally has failed.</p>
<p>Update: It's 11am now and it's amazing to see that we're exhibiting the
<em>exact</em> same pattern as Friday morning ... Take a look at the updated
Figure 2. The price, the TICK, and even the A-D line are almost
identical! A late day rally and then a fake down can shake out many weak
bulls or trap some bears when everyone expects a breakdown like the late
day Friday. And then a real rally could commence? This is just wishful
thinking, don't read too much into it.</p>
<p>Update 2: S&amp;P closed right at 850 today. The market weakened in the last
hour. The prospect for a rally is looking dimmer. I hessitated to sell
my ABB short puts when it failed to break \$11.10 late in the day. I
have set my limit order too low (at bid price) and let the price got
away from me. I think this mistake is going to cost me.</p>

<p>Just when I thought I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/day-after-95-point-rally-retracement-still-looking-good/">don't have to watch the market every hour</a> and
left for the afternoon, the S&amp;P 500 crashed 40 points in the last hour
on Friday. In particular, the move in the last 5 minutes was <em>vertical</em>
for all intents and purposes!</p>
<p>Looking at the TICK and Advance-Decline line, there doesn't seem to be a
broad sell-off as the panic-like move would suggest. This seems like a
concentrated sell-off effort. Which <em>might</em> suggest of an artificial
move directed for the G20 meeting this weekend. Read that with a grain
of salt though, this is wild speculation at best.</p>
<p>Actually, what's important is that Thursday's rally energy didn't carry
over to Friday. Notice on Figure 1 that even the mid-day 870 reversal
didn't pack much punch. We have double topped with a lower volume
weighted MACD (Figure 1). This is a bad bearing divergence. 920 would
have been a good point to unload when the volume didn't pick up. But I
was away anyway, and I doubt I would have the insight at the time to
unload.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we are still above my line in the sand at 865. And as
I've mentioned before, the TICK and A-D line are giving a neutral
reading. My short term bullishness hasn't died yet, but we could very
well retest 820 before moving up. Even worse, I am now accepting the
possiblity of continued weakness in the market due to lack of steam.
Bull shakeout or not, this pre-weekend stunt has definitely shaken many
bulls.</p>
<p>I will watch the market next week and decide what I'll do with my long
positions. At this point, I am inclined to unload my short puts some
time next week to reduce my downside. As for my calls, with just another
week until option expiration, I would rather hang on to them to position
myself for a rally. I got my calls all for dirt cheap anyway, so they
are entirely disposable if they expire next week. This is a great
example of my trading rule to <strong>always plan for the worst before
entering a trade</strong>.</p>
<p>Overall, my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">recent entries</a> are downgraded from a high reward, low
risk, high probability play to a high reward, low risk, low probability
play.</p>
<p>On a sidenote, one thing I noticed in the past two days is that there
doesn't seem to be any report from the mass media at all. The Thursday
95-point rally and Friday last minute crash were unnoticed by the
general public. These type of roller coaster volatilities seem to be
part of normal day lives nowadays.</p>

<p>The retracement from <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/a-recollection-of-my-analysis-for-buying-when-sp-broke-down-to-820-today/">yesterday's monster reversal</a> is in progress. I
intend to take a more hands-off approach now and not have to hug my
market screen all day. It's just a more practical approach in the long
run for me.</p>
<p>So here's my after-lunch review of the market. The expected retracement
is under way. We have tested 870 on the S&amp;P and bounced off. The support
test volume was normal, but still 1/3 of yesterday's volume at about the
price level. I doubt we will break below this 870 intraday low today.</p>
<p>In particular, the pre-11am move looked good because we managed to keep
the 880 level. 880 is important because it's the resistance on Wednesday
and the first support level from yesterday's close. I didn't expect it
to hold because yesterday's 95 point move was a bit over done (like
everything else these days).</p>
<p>Even if the market breaks lower from here, we still have my mental
supporting line of SPY \$86.5 (high of the 30 min with the 2nd highest
volume time slot yesterday) and the fibonacci 61.8% of \$85.82 on the
SPY.</p>
<p>I will probably be off for the rest of the day. I haven't sold anything
yet, since we are in a retracement mode and the test looks strong so
far. I'd rather <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">sell on strength as planned</a>. It looks like we will
zig zag up from here at least for a few days.</p>
<p>Today's close will provide a sign of what I'll do with my positions next
week.</p>

<p>Finally! I have been waiting for a bear market rally for weeks! I
decided to go <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">full long after the bounce from 820 today</a>. Refer to
that post for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">details of my entries</a>. In this post, I would like to discuss why the 820 bounce
gave me the confidence in going all in despite widespread fear and the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/covered-slw-fro-and-wfc-short-puts/">many failed attempts</a> myself.</p>
<p>A quick recap of the past week's action. After the failed rally attempt
from 10/28 to 11/04, the market has been brutal to say the least. Any
strength failed to stir enthusiasm and has bled down slowly. The market
drifted down lower on little volume day after day. If I were to describe
the market, I'd say it looked like the last moment of a dying man. This
lack of will to move has certainly killed many bulls. I was one of them.
I have been stopped out a few times trying to catch this falling knife
(more like a grind). I even prepared to exit the last of my holdings if
we do break down from this point.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the day, the market looked like it's going to be
another down drift today. But being very near the 10/10 bottom already,
I know things are going to move one way or the other before the options
expiry next week. And since the Max Pain for the index options are at
least 10% higher, I am still looking for a reversal soon.</p>
<p>I mentally noted S&amp;P at 845 is an important level. It was the low of the
10/28 big rally day. The market skid on the 845 level all morning with
little volume. That was good because it is testing a support on low
volume. I had thought we may bounce from there.</p>
<p>Then I went to lunch just before noon.</p>
<p>When I got back after 1pm, the market has already broken down. However,
there are several bullish indication I noticed.</p>
<ol>
<li>the break down volume is higher than the previous bar (Figure 1),
    but it's still relatively low. Which means we don't have panic
    selling yet.</li>
<li>both the TICK and Advance-Decline line moving averages (Figure 2)
    are relatively healthy for such an important drop. Indicating no
    broad selling.</li>
<li>notice the unusual V shape for the TICK (Figure 2)? We even reached
    a new multi-day low of -1666. Yet #1 and #2 contradicts this
    seemingly panic selling, so this depression in price looked
    artificial to me</li>
</ol>
<p>Like how the recent rally attempts lacked enthusiasm, this break of 845
and test of 820 looked like it lacked enthusiasm too. Given that this is
such a major support level, odds are that we will bounce from here at
least for intraday. That is when I made my entry.</p>
<p></p>
Before 2pm, we broke 850, the low of yesterday, with the highest 30 min
volume of the week. That is when the rally looked strong to me and my
doubt of a bull trap eased. Frankly, I had some tight mental stops and
prepared to jump if things deteriorate like the many times before.</p>
<p>The day continued strong with price and volume confirmation. We closed
at the high with significant volume. We even reached 700 million volume
on SPY, a first since 10/16. I believe an intermediate bottom has been
set so I'll be looking at a longer timeframe (days) for my long
positions now.</p>
<p>First expected resistance from this move is 980 on the S&amp;P from the
trendline (Figure 1, right). Target is at least the 50 dma, we just
haven't touched it for 2 months. This is as good a time as ever to give
it a run for it.</p>
<p>Today is a great example of the need for critical thinking with a clear
head in light of a lot of pressure and past emotion. The beaten account,
the grim market movement, and the many stopped out trades has nearly
made me walk away for the week. But I remained focus on the market and
made my decision based on the price action.</p>
<p>Despite renewed optimism, I will continue to practice <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">prudent risk
management</a> and to eventually pocket at least most of the profit from
today, if not more.</p>
