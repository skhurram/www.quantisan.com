<p>I've sold my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-58-caf-2889-limit/">CAF position bought at \$28.89</a> for \$21.69. A loss of
about \$430. I placed a limit order, and only 56 of the 58 went through.
I'll assume my 2 remaining shares will go through some time today (it
has gone through as I'm writing this). Fee \$5.</p>
<p>CAF gapped open about \$2 today due to this weekend's news of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/world/asia/10china.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business&amp;oref=slogin">China's
plan for a stimulus package of about US\$586 billion</a>. However, CAF
seem to be being faded on this news. The total downtick volume looks
significant.</p>
<p>On the other hand, FXP (UltraShort China) looks to be on the rise. A
break of above \$70 would be very bullish for it.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_665" align="aligncenter" width="500"

<p>My bullish view on China in the long term still remains strong. However,
I don't think we're in a time for buy-and-hold strategy anymore. This is
definitely a trader's market and I intend to put my money for swing
trading opportunities. Even though I sold at a significant loss and a
return of CAF to \$25 level seems likely in the short term, I believe I
will lose even more in opportunity cost if my fund is tied with CAF. So
I'm exiting on this weekend news and price strength.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-down-of-this-weeks-trading-range/">Like the market</a>, my holdings are going sideway this week near their
lows. Based on the price/volume observation this week, here's my
short-term ranking from strong to weak.</p>
<ol>
<li>ESLR</li>
<li>DELL</li>
<li>CAF</li>
<li>SLW</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel ESLR is strongest because of the last hour spike last Friday on 1
million+ volume. They are now sueing Barclays and Lehman to return their
30.9 million loaned shares.</p>
<p></p>
DELL is showing some resilience despite negative news on Yahoo today. It
is testing its low the 2nd time at end-of-day today on a regular
late-day volume. The next day or two will be important times for DELL in
the short term.</p>
<p>CAF is just drifting sideway for now on low volume.</p>
<p>SLW is now under pressure because of weakness in precious metals and the
Euro.</p>

<p>It's time to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/eslr-testing-long-term-low/">review my positions as promised last week</a>. After the
record up day on Monday and then the lackluster follow-through Tuesday,
today is probably going to be a down day in the markets. Given <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/mid-week-market-review-october-15-2008/">my
intermediate term outlook</a>, I am inclined to hold my positions.
However, I need to unload my weakest link to reduce my risk.</p>
<p>Above is a quick snapshot of my current holdings.</p>
<p>Notice that DELL and ESLR are holding on nicely on this down (DJX
-3.18%, SPX -3.57% as of this writing) day after the previous spike.
This is a very good sign indeed as it shows they're likly to hold on to
the previous \~20% gain, at least for now.</p>
<p>Actually, the price action of ESLR seem very healthy in particular.
There's been a couple of big volume spikes in late day trading. Although
it does seem to be in a constant downtrend, as you can see from its
chart.</p>
<p>As for CAF and SLW they are both below support at the moment. CAF has
broken its \$25 support last Friday and is trading below it at the
moment. SLW is definitely the weakest at the moment. If it isn't such a
cash cow, I would probably be selling it in yesterday's rally.
Furthermore, it still seems to be holding on to its decending support
line on the daily chart today.</p>

<p>At this point, the question I ask myself is, if I'm in all cash now,
would I be buying these companies at this point? CAF - yes, DELL - yes,
ESLR - yes, SLW - yes. Is this the bottom? I don't know. I'll just have
to wait and see. However, I will watch the day-to-day action of my
holdings carefully and unload one of two of them to reduce my risk.</p>

<p>This is suppose to be another of my GTC limit order before leaving to
Taiwan. I've set the buy order at \$25.0 on 25th. I got back on the 30th
(29th EST) and CAF looked strong. So I wanted to replace my \$25 bid to
\$26... However, I wasn't careful and the trading platform changed the
limit price to the market ask without me realizing until I placed the
order. Of course, then the order was filled and I got in at \$28.89,
higher than I would have wanted. I thought of exiting the position
immediately, at a small lost, but decided against it because I felt CAF
is going strong. I didn't need to pick the bottom and I was never good
at that anway. So I chose to stick with this entry.</p>
<p>But what do ya know, that afternoon, the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aJY4KBvL.dRE&amp;refer=home">US House decided to reject the
\$700-billion rescue plan</a>. DJIA tanked 777 points that day and the
financials were hit the hardest of course. My \$26 bid would have seemed
like an ingeneous entry as CAF hit a low of \$25.11 that day. However, I
wouldn't have guessed that.</p>
<p>Given the high amount of volume at the low and near the end of the
trading day, I doubt we will see that price any time soon for CAF. \$25
is definitely a strong support.</p>
<p>Upside: Daily chart still looks good. Financials are in severe panic
mode.</p>
<p>Resistance: A downward trendline is capping recent highs. \$30 round
number looks like the high end of trading range.</p>
<p>Downside: Possible turn to bearish from indicators. Financials earnings
coming soon, the numbers aren't gonna be pretty.</p>
<p>Support: \$26 looks like the bottom of the trading range we're in now.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: CAF has weathered the Dow 777 day drop with style. It has
shown strength at the worst of times. However, don't expect a steady
climb from here. At this market's condition, anything is possible (i.e.
more panic days in the coming weeks and CAF would be thrown out along
with the financials again). I don't think this is to be a buy and hold
position yet. So watch for breakouts either way and be ready to trade in
and out.</p>
<p>On another note, if I have more funds, I'd rather be scaling in CAF on
the lows for the long term instead of swing trading for a few bucks.</p>
