                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/" rel='bookmark'>An explanation of my Keltner Channel and Candlestick hybrid setup</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is an explanation of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading</a> strategy for the
Dukascopy JForex Strategy Contest in April. This strategy just made its
first trade today after running for about 72 hours. My contest demo
account closed with a gain of 7% on this first trade. Note that this
strategy is built for competing in a contest and not for real trading
(i.e., it's purely a no cost gamble). Here is the concept for this high
probability trading setup. Referring to Figure 1 below, the red arrow
marks my short entry on EURGBP today. These are the technical analysis
indicators the strategy uses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend: Signaled by 50 bar moving average above (bullish) or below
    (bearish) the 200 bar moving average.</li>
<li>Momentum: Oversold or overbought RSI conditions, but not used in a
    traditional manner...</li>
<li>Volatility: I use the Keltner channel to measure volatility.</li>
<li>Price action: Observe candlestick behaviour to identify trend
    continuation. This is where the secret to this strategy happens. I
    will explain this below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that I used a Bollinger Bands in the chart of Figure 1 because I
couldn't find the Keltner Channel indicator in Metatrader (my charting
software). It doesn't affect my conceptual illustration anyhow. The
setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify overarching trend via 50/200 moving averages as explained
    above.</li>
<li>Confirm price is still playing to the trend by checking if current
    market price is on the right side of the 200 bars moving average.
    Price above for bullish and below for bearish.</li>
<li>Once steps 1-2 are in place, it's assumed that the trend is strong.
    We look for a setup in the trend's direction. In particular, we look
    for a <em>failed counter-trend retracement</em> setup using candlestick in
    combination with the Keltner channel.</li>
<li>Sounds fancy but it's simple. Using a short-side example, the bar's
    high has to penetrate above the Keltner channel yet it closes within
    it. Then the short entry is signaled. The opposite for a long-side
    entry.</li>
<li>RSI overbought and oversold conditions are used to filter out slow
    and steady counter-trend moves (those are evil).</li>
</ol>
<p>Another benefit of using a price channel is that I also use it to peg my
take profit target and stop loss. As I said in my previous post, because
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> expects winning contestants to submit their source codes,
I am not using anything proprietary or extraordinary here. As such, this
is totally different than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">what I use to trade on my own</a>. Namely more
reliance on indicators and less on price action and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p><strong>Update</strong>: I have since <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">won the JForex strategy contest a few
times</a>. If you are looking to learn JForex programming, you can start
with <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-multiple-time-frame-strategy/">an explanation of my winning strategy</a> and my long <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/jforex/">list of
JForex posts</a>. The Dukascopy JForex Strategy Contest began last week.
Starting this month, <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> offers \$15,000 total of cash prizes
to the top 10 automated trading systems every month. However, before
entering, there are a couple of clauses in their contest rules that
caught my attention.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cash prizes are deposited into contestant's Dukascopy account
    (Ranking and Awarding Rules #5).</li>
<li>All source code needs to be submitted and agrees to be published
    (Ranking and Awarding Rules #2 and #6).</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 is troublesome because it means winners have to <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">open an account
with Dukascopy</a> if they don't already have an account with
them. But that isn't a big deal since they are actually one of the best
forex brokers. I planned to open an account with them anyway. However,
#2 will certainly turn many people away. The requirement to disclose
source code in an automated trading contest is almost unheard of as far
as I know. Are you willing to disclose your winning system just for that
few hundred, or a even few thousand, dollars of prize money? In any
case, I decided to enter this contest anyway just for fun. Yet, you can
be sure that I won't be using any proprietary logic in my system. In
fact, I just finished my automated trading strategy today and it is now
running. I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/">discuss about my strategy</a> after it completes its
first trade. That might take a while as my system is expected to make
fewer than 5 trades in a month.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Once upon a time, I was a happy forex student. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/tag/paper%20trade/">paper traded</a> on
Oanda for a few months and even opened a live account with them. Then my
work place tightened up our internet firewall at work. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-to-do-when-life-gets-in-your-way-of-trading/">couldn't
access market data anymore</a> during the day. Fortunately, Dukascopy at
the time said that they'll be <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">enabling micro-lot trading</a>. So I moved
to practice with Dukascopy. Then last weekend, Dukascopy said <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/no-micro-lot-trading-at-dukascopy-metatrader-4-accounts/">no
micro-lot trading on their Metatrader 4 accounts</a>. I move to another
broker again. My last stop (so far) is at MB Trading. However, after
practicing with them for a week, I remembered why I didn't go with them
in the first place. They don't offer Canadian denominated account
currency! Fortunately, they do say that they're in the process of
enabling more account currencies. But who knows how long that might
take? My head is spinning from all this mess. I don't think I am asking
too much from a forex broker. I just want five features from them.</p>
<ol>
<li>good reputation</li>
<li>micro-lot trading</li>
<li>Metatrader platform</li>
<li>free API access</li>
<li>Canadian dollar denominated account currency</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all! Why am I being shut out everytime just when I am about to
open a live account? On top of that trouble, there's the question of
which trading platform to use. Over the past few months, I have tried
many forex brokers and their forex trading platforms. From proprietary
ones like FXTrade (Oanda), JForex (Dukascopy), and Dealbook 360 (GFT) to
the popular, third-party Metatrader 4 platform. I decided to settle with
Metatrader 4 because its charting is sufficient and scripting on it is
fairly easy. I learned MQL4 (MT4's scripting language) in a few hours
and wrote my first EA in a few days. The problem with Metatrader 4
though, is Metatrader 5. Scripts written for MT4 is incompatible on MT5.
As I intend to trade semi-automatically via expert advisors, this is a
huge problem for me. I don't want to start developing for MT4 and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">only
to have to convert everything again</a>. I thought I could evade this
MT4-MT5 dilemma with a non-American forex broker (<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143">Dukascopy</a>) as
they're more likely to stay with MT4. But now that I can't trade with
them anymore, my best potential broker is MB Trading. Which is probably
upgrading to MT5 once it's out. Note: MT5 is built for new NFA
regulations, so American brokers probably have to upgrade. I think I
have had enough moves for now. So screw this all! I will focus on
learning Python programming for the next few weeks. While waiting for MB
Trading to adopt Canadian dollar accounts (or I come across a new
broker), and the duel between Metatrader 4 and 5 is settled.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>
Update: It doesn't look as though Dukascopy will proceed with using MT4.
So you might as well look for another broker if you need MT4 or [learn
to use JForex][] if you plan on sticking with Dukascopy. Just received
the following news from [Dukascopy][] (attached below) regarding their
Metatrader accounts. Basically, they are raising their minimum lot-size
on MT4-enabled accounts to a mini-lot (10k). Micro-lot (1000 units)
trading remains exclusive to their basic (JForex only) accounts. Well,
why do bad news keep coming to me just when I'm about to go live with a
forex broker? First it was Oanda (although the problem was at my end
with them), then Dukascopy. There's no way I'm able to trade with a
mini-lot because of my strict [risk management][] rules. So I would be
stuck with the JForex platform for a while if I'm going to trade with
them. I like the JForex platform. It is simple, clean, easy to use, and
powerful. However, Metatrader is just substantially more popular. There
are hundreds of free scripts, indicators, and expert advisers published
at MQL4.com for me to edit to my liking. If I go with JForex, I'd have
to write everything from scratch. The whole point of me using a built-in
editor is to save time. So I might as well program in Python and use an
API if I need to go through learning JForex scripting, programming, and
testing. As much as I like [Dukascopy][] (35% commission rebate
affiliate link), ~~I may not be going through to trade with them
anymore. Unfortunate, really.~~
