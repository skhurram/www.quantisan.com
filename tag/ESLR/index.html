<p>Covered my [short puts on ESLR shorted at \$1.60][] yesterday for
\$1.40. The S&amp;P just touched 930 level and backed down. This could go up
to 940 or back down to 900. The risk/reward doesn't look too good, so
I'm unloading my ESLR options to re-enter later.</p>
<p>This was a short term position as planned. On the other hand, I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-4-dell-100-dec-08-13-put-180/">unloaded my DELL options</a> a bit too early in hindsight. DELL was
about 12.17 when I exited, now it's at 12.36.</p>

<p>Wrote some puts on ESLR for Dec08 at strike 5 for \$1.60. Yesterday
after market, news of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINN0534765020081106?rpc=44">a judge denying Evergreen request on return of
Barclays shares</a> sent the shares tumbling today. Furthermore, the
overall market is sinking on light volume since the election.</p>
<p>However, today's open 15min volume is about 40% lower than than the up
open volume on Monday at the same price level. In other words, the panic
selling isn't as that bad, although the price has dropped 12%.</p>
<p>Upside: Good up volume, light down volume on 15 min and daily chart for
the past week and more. Broad market selloff shows positive divergence
on various indicators intraday. ESLR prices retraced to about 62% of
fibonacci level and bouncing back up.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$6, peaked at \$5.72 a couple of days ago too and
congestion at that point from farther back.</p>
<p>Downside: Broad market selloff. Low volume rally before election. Low
volume selloff after election. Just low volume all week in the market.
ESLR not profitable yet. Factory done next June. Difficult to raise
capital to expand production to meet backlog in these times.</p>
<p>Support: 20 dma at \$3.50.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Recent solar rally looked strong. Company outlook seems
good. Profit taking retracement plus the overnight bad news together
haven't broken the new uptrend yet. This will again be a bullish swing
trade.</p>
<p>The broad market shouldn't fall to a new low prior to breaking some
highs. Everyone that wants to sell has sold in the October crash
already. We need some new highs and optimism to lure in new blood to be
sucked on by the pros before another crash can be profitable to them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-down-of-this-weeks-trading-range/">Like the market</a>, my holdings are going sideway this week near their
lows. Based on the price/volume observation this week, here's my
short-term ranking from strong to weak.</p>
<ol>
<li>ESLR</li>
<li>DELL</li>
<li>CAF</li>
<li>SLW</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel ESLR is strongest because of the last hour spike last Friday on 1
million+ volume. They are now sueing Barclays and Lehman to return their
30.9 million loaned shares.</p>
<p></p>
DELL is showing some resilience despite negative news on Yahoo today. It
is testing its low the 2nd time at end-of-day today on a regular
late-day volume. The next day or two will be important times for DELL in
the short term.</p>
<p>CAF is just drifting sideway for now on low volume.</p>
<p>SLW is now under pressure because of weakness in precious metals and the
Euro.</p>

<p>It's time to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/eslr-testing-long-term-low/">review my positions as promised last week</a>. After the
record up day on Monday and then the lackluster follow-through Tuesday,
today is probably going to be a down day in the markets. Given <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/mid-week-market-review-october-15-2008/">my
intermediate term outlook</a>, I am inclined to hold my positions.
However, I need to unload my weakest link to reduce my risk.</p>
<p>Above is a quick snapshot of my current holdings.</p>
<p>Notice that DELL and ESLR are holding on nicely on this down (DJX
-3.18%, SPX -3.57% as of this writing) day after the previous spike.
This is a very good sign indeed as it shows they're likly to hold on to
the previous \~20% gain, at least for now.</p>
<p>Actually, the price action of ESLR seem very healthy in particular.
There's been a couple of big volume spikes in late day trading. Although
it does seem to be in a constant downtrend, as you can see from its
chart.</p>
<p>As for CAF and SLW they are both below support at the moment. CAF has
broken its \$25 support last Friday and is trading below it at the
moment. SLW is definitely the weakest at the moment. If it isn't such a
cash cow, I would probably be selling it in yesterday's rally.
Furthermore, it still seems to be holding on to its decending support
line on the daily chart today.</p>

<p>At this point, the question I ask myself is, if I'm in all cash now,
would I be buying these companies at this point? CAF - yes, DELL - yes,
ESLR - yes, SLW - yes. Is this the bottom? I don't know. I'll just have
to wait and see. However, I will watch the day-to-day action of my
holdings carefully and unload one of two of them to reduce my risk.</p>

<p>In light of the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/market-capitulation-under-way/">market crash this week</a>, my ESLR is the holding that
worries me the most. It is the only one of my holdings without any
profit at the moment. At times like we're in now, ideally I would only
go long on the strongest companies, in the strongest sectors.</p>
<p>ESLR closed at 3.44 today. It's long term low is at 3.3. Here's a quick
reassessment of the situation.</p>
<p>Upside: Still above support level while markets are hitting new lows.
Lots of volume at the previous \$5 level. MACD and Stochastic showing
divergence, assuming it doesn't break support... definitely too early to
tell. Volume is uptrending on recent fall.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$4.</p>
<p>Downside: Low volume on recent small rally. Little volume today when
it's testing the low. Trend is still negative.</p>
<p>Support: \$3.3 and then ... \$2.50? Ouch!</p>
<p>Bottom line: Lots of panic and fear at the moment. Contrarian buy signal
perhaps? I'm not buying or selling at this level in any case. I'm going
to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/didnt-cut-losses-as-planned-and-now-paying-dearly/">stick to my plan and brace through this week</a>. Then I'll either
surrender my shares at a huge loss or keep holding for the longer term.</p>
<p>Here's my take on a purely speculative feel... the recent action on ESLR
seems like it's being accumulated by some big players. Two-stage
accumulation: 1) Huge reverse on new low to lure in chasers. 2) Price
drifts back down on increasing volume, but not too much to attract
attention. I don't know, this could be my emotion talking. That's why
I'm waiting for things to calm down first before making a move.</p>

<p>I placed some limit sell on ESLR last Friday at \$6, and then lowered to
\$5.7. I lowered it again to \$5.6 in the morning and actually thought
of executing a market sell when it was around \$5.55. In that hour or
so, I pondered should I exit my ESLR to limit my exposure to market
volatility. At the time, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/slw-and-eslr-broke-support-and-stop/">ESLR was my weakest position</a>, and my 2nd
most money losing holding.</p>
<p>My intraday signals were showing weakness, but my daily was undecided.
Just before lunch, I decided to keep my shares (and cancelled my exit
working order) because I want to hold this for the long term (at least
weeks).</p>
<p>In retrospect, I really should trust my signals. I knew the market could
dive in the short term as we haven't reached capitulation and widespread
fear yet. I have let my emotion got the better of me by not wanting to
miss the bottom. In hindsight, the phrase "it's better to be safe than
sorry" couldn't have been more appropriate.</p>
<p>ESLR closed at \$3.47 yesterday, way below my initial [stop loss target
of \$5.6][]. The time to cut losses short is long gone. It's either
surrender now or wait for the calming of the market.</p>
<p>I decided to wait through the storm in this round. I still think we are
very near the bottom. Hmm... haven't I said that before already when
ESLR was at \$6.0+ ... ?</p>

<p>Seriously, I will wait a few days until making an order. There's too
much emotion in the market at the moment. (i.e. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122346445779914857.html">WSJ: Central Banks Cut
