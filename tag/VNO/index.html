            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm back in <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-2-vno-100-aug-09-55-put-1-90-mark-56-1399/">Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) once again</a>. This time, I'm
giving it a longer time frame by buying the September puts instead of
the August. The 60 puts premium between the August and September is only
more by 25% or so. And the theta on the September puts are lower.</p>
<p>The market is very choppy lately around this 1000 pivot for the S&amp;P500.
Thus, I've found myself spending way too much time watching the market
when I'm supposed to be doing other things. So I'm putting my chips in
now, at a point which I think have passed the near term top based on
yesterday's close and today's open, to keep myself off the screen.</p>
<p>I was comparing between VNO or COF for this position. Both looked like
good candidates for a short but VNO has a higher weekly RSI at the
moment, so I decided to go for it.</p>
<p>Entry: \$57.48</p>
<p>Stop: \$58, today's high at the open</p>
<p>Target: \$45, see Figure 2</p>
<p>Also, I've put in a hard stop for my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-rth-100-aug-09-85-put-3-30-mark-82-91/">RTH August put</a> too.</p>
<p>Update: I was trying to place a stop order just now and forgot to change
it from the default limit order to stop, so <strong>I accidentally sold my
puts with a horrible spread for \$6.01</strong>!</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-vno-100-aug-09-55-put-2-50-mark-54-60/">this VNO short from the morning</a> didn't last long. My stop got
triggered in the afternoon on the same day. I was taking a wait and see
approach when VNO pushed above \$55.40. Once my stop was hit, VNO
steamed upward without taking a breather. So I ended up having to ditch
my puts at a higher than expected loss. Total loss is about \$120 +
\$15.</p>
<p>I thought I was being safe already by <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-vno-100-aug-09-55-put-2-50-mark-54-60/">entering a bit later than
usual</a>. But what got me this time is
for failing to set a hard stop. When we dipped below \$54 momentarily in
the morning and then held a higher low, that should have been the first
warning. And when we held above \$54.50 for most of the day, that was
the second warning. Then when we broke above \$55, I should have dumped
my shorts.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Remember <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/vno-short-entry-stop-4970/">Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)</a>? Well, I'm back to shorting it
with this new August puts position. Yesterday, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-31-srs-22-45/">Ultrashort Real Estate
(SRS)</a> tanked about 9% to touch \$13 while the overall market is
mostly unchanged. I also noticed some big down TICK (\&lt; -1000) were
finally appearing. This is a sign that big blocks were being dumped. We
haven't see those in a long time.</p>
<p>I tried to short VNO near the close but the price never came back to me.
VNO stayed below \$54 resistance. So I held my bid to wait for today. We
seem to have a lot of bear traps lately so it's better late than early.
Well, today we broke above \$55 to touch \$55.61 (a major resistance)
and backed down immediately. In the first half hour alone, it seemed
like VNO is starting to decline. This is a good sign since S&amp;P500 also
broke below 1000 in the first half hour with some big negative TICK (\&lt;
-800). This is definitely going to be an interesting day.</p>
<p>What enticed me the most in VNO is shown in Figure 2. VNO has been
respecting the Fibonacci fan lines from the recent crack of late
'08/early '09 very well. So this failed push above it this morning was a
good signal for me to go short now (coupled with the market weakness).</p>
<p>Entry: \$54.60</p>
<p>Stop: \$55.5</p>
<p>Target: \$47, but looking at \$43 in the intermediate term (prob need to
rollover the puts)</p>
<p>Reward / Risk = 7.6 / 0.9 = 8.4</p>

                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/vno-short-entry-stop-4970/" rel='bookmark'>VNO: Short Entry Stop $49.70</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Here's another <strong>paper trade</strong>. I've been trying this new strategy a
couple of times now, although it has generated 2 entry orders, none were
triggered so far (the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-50-scsc-2352/">SCSC trade</a> was from version 1, I'm at version
1.1 now). This is mostly because I've been entering shorts but the
market has been chugging upward like a relentless train. It's not that
I'm not keeping an open mind, but at this point, I haven't been able to
spot a good long trade.</p>
<p>Here are my logic for this play.</p>
<p>​1. We are still in a long term bear market. Although we're definitely
in an intermediate up trend at the moment.</p>
<p>​2. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) is a real estate play. Everyone knows
real estate stocks are in a severe bear trend. That's inline with the
direction of this play.</p>
<p>​3. VNO is testing the lower boundary of a congestion zone between
\$50-\$60.</p>
<p>​4. VNO's weekly indicators look bearish. And its daily ones look way
overbought.</p>
<p>​5. I am entering below its current up channel and below a support at
\$49.76.</p>
<p>​6. Reward/Risk of 7.07/1.90 = 3.72</p>
<p>Points 1-5 setup a favourable probability of this trade. Point 6 is the
reward/risk.</p>
<p>Entry stop: \$49.70</p>
<p>Exit stop: \$51.60</p>
<p>Target: \$42.63</p>
<p>The target I'm setting is a long term support from December of 2008. It
is also above the 25% intermediate term upward channel established from
March 2009, the bounce from its low. And it is at the 50% Fibonacci
retracement level from its recent run.</p>
<p>Update: My entry was triggered at 9:34 a.m. I have 25 shares of VNO
shorted at \$49.70 on paper now.</p>
<p>Update2: VNO almost touched \$52 on Friday May 8, so my position was
stopped out. I will probably put on another trade as VNO came back down
to below \$50 on Monday today.</p>
