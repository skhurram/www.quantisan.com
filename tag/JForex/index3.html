            <div class="article-content"> <p>I ported <a href="http://engineering-returns.com/tsi/">Engineering Return's Trend Strength Index</a> to JForex as my
first practice to writing custom indicators in JForex. Frank's code in
TradeSignal consists of 9 lines. My JForex code? 191. This is my first
custom indicator in JForex. It will also be the last. A compiled
programming language such as Java is not the most convenient to use for
data analysis. The lack of interactivity because of the step of
compilation is one obstacle to fluent data explorations. Secondly, the
language itself is more cumbersome because of its generality. Java is
used to build all sorts of applications. Contrary to something like
MatLab, in which it is purposely built to work with numbers. I miss <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/starting-to-use-matlab-for-quantitative-finance/">the
days when I have my license for MatLab</a>. However, being forced away
from MatLab might not be a bad thing. As much as I've become accustomed
to it, MatLab isn't without its flaws. But I won't bash it in this post.
What I actually want to talk about is R. The rage these days in
statistical data analysis is in R (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29">Wiki entry on R</a>). I've done
some research and testing, R is really as good as they say it is (see
past publications in <a href="http://www.rinfinance.com/">R/Finance conference</a><a href="http://probability.ca/cran/doc/contrib/Farnsworth-EconometricsInR.pdf"></a>). You will get to see
some real examples in financial time series data analysis in R later in
this blog once I have some publishable results. This will no doubt take
some time as I am learning yet another new programming language (thus
the lack of posts this week). The plan from now on is to use R to play
with the data. Then once the algorithm is finalized, I will either port
it to Java (JForex) for deployment or <a href="http://www.rforge.net/rJava/">embed the R environment in
Java</a> for live trading.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have won first place in the August <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> JForex contest! My
automated strategy returned over 45% in the month of August. With that
honour comes <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/contests/strategy_contest/august-2010/">a \$5,000 grand prize</a> in real greenbacks. The setup
that I used is a minor updated version of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-dual-timeframe-moving-averages-setup/">the one I used last month</a>.
I continue to adapt my system to expect market conditions of the month
ahead. Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong. This contest is turning
out to be more than a nerdy pass time for me as I have finished in the
top 10 three times already since it started in April. However, I must
reiterate the fact that this is not real trading. It's just a paper
trading contest with no real money risked on my part. If I'm really that
good at trading to make 45% of return a month, I wouldn't be writing
this post at lunch in my cubicle at this moment. So yes, back to reality
as I continue my engineering work while improving my own trading and
developing my quantitative trading system in my spare time. As my blog's
tagline reads, this is an engineer's training to trade for a living.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Proper position sizing is an integral part of risk management. It <em>can</em>
be one of the easiest thing to do too. For example, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/">typically size my
trading position</a> based on the following factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amount of capital willing to put at risk.</li>
<li>Stop price level.</li>
<li>Volatility of the instrument.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following JForex code calculates a lot size based on these three
factors. It is part of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sixth-place-finish-in-the-dukascopy-jforex-july-strategy-contest/">Dukascopy JForex July strategy</a> (complete
source code to the strategy is available via that link). [java
firstline="232"] private double getLot(Instrument instrument) throws
JFException { double riskAmt; double lotSize = 0; riskAmt =
this.acctEquity * (this.riskPct / 100d); // CCYUSD only lotSize =
riskAmt / (this.atr[instrument.ordinal()] * this.atrFactor); lotSize /=
1000000d; // in millions return roundLot(lotSize); } [/java] Referring
to line 237, riskAmt is the amount of capital to put at risk for a trade
(#1). Line 238 calculates lotSize, which is the position size that we
want. The denominator in that division is the distance of the stop in
pips. The strategy uses a multiple of ATR to set the stop loss. Nothing
fancy here. Lines 240--241 are to set the lotSize value according to the
JForex API specification. In which the lot amount is in millions and in
steps of a thousand units, or 0.001 step size. As I've noted in the
code, the caveat to this implementation is that the secondary currency
of the instrument and your account currency needs to be in U.S. dollar.
However, it's just a matter of conversion to extend this method for
other currencies. Update: I expanded on this functionality in the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">JFUtil open source project</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>While the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-dual-timeframe-moving-averages-setup/">dual-timeframe trading setup</a> and much of the algorithm in
my contest strategy are for competition only (read: not for use with
real money) as I've warned numerous times, some of the risk management
techniques used there are really what I use in real life. This being one
of them. There's a saying in trading that "never let profits turns into
losses." That is exactly the motivation behind this JForex code snippet.
The following source code are excerpts from my <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> JForex
contest's <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sixth-place-finish-in-the-dukascopy-jforex-july-strategy-contest/">July strategy</a>. The complete source code file is available
in that link. Back to this concept of not letting profits turn to
losses. This is a matter of balancing between giving room for your trade
to reach its potential and limiting your drawdown. If you're too
careful, you may find yourself being whipsawed out before a price move
can materialize. If you keep your leash too loose though, well, you may
watch your profits turn into losses. The way I intrepret the saying is
that once your trade is profitable enough, you shouldn't let it slip
back into a loss. I implement the above statement in my automated
strategy as follows. Note that everything goes in the onTick() method so
that it watches your position on every tick. The line numbers correspond
to the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sixth-place-finish-in-the-dukascopy-jforex-july-strategy-contest/">complete source code</a> of my automated strategy.
[java firstline="177"] boolean isLong; double open, stop, diff, newStop;
for (IOrder order : engine.getOrders(instrument)) { if (order.getState()
== IOrder.State.FILLED) { [/java] [java firstline="191"] isLong =
order.isLong(); open = order.getOpenPrice(); stop =
order.getStopLossPrice(); diff = (open - stop); // *********
BREAKEVEN *********************** if (isLong &amp;&amp;
diff > 0 &amp;&amp; tick.getBid() > (open + diff)) {
order.close(roundLot(order.getAmount() * beRatio)); // close a portion
newStop = open + instrument.getPipValue() * LOCKPIP;
order.setStopLossPrice(newStop); print(order.getLabel() + ": Moved STOP
to breakeven"); } else if (!isLong &amp;&amp; diff \&lt; 0 &amp;&amp; tick.getAsk() \&lt;
(open + diff)) { order.close(roundLot(order.getAmount() * beRatio));
newStop = open - (instrument.getPipValue() * LOCKPIP);
order.setStopLossPrice(newStop); print(order.getLabel() + ": Moved STOP
to breakeven"); } [/java] What this does is that it will partially exit
a position and move the stop to breakeven once the price is
equidistantly positive from your initial stop loss. For example, if my
stop loss is 100 pips, then once the position is 100 pips <em>in profit</em>,
it will exit partially and set the new stop to breakeven. Update: This
is now integrated into the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">JFUtil open source project</a>.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>This post describes the setup for my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sixth-place-finish-in-the-dukascopy-jforex-july-strategy-contest/">Dukascopy JForex automated trading
strategy in July</a>. Note that this strategy is built for competing in a
contest and not for real trading (i.e., its purely a
no cost gamble). Here is the step by step process of the setup for a
long position:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the current trend by the relative position of current
    price to its moving average <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-multiple-time-frame-strategy/">in a higher time frame</a>. In
    particular, a price above the moving average in the higher time
    frame is deemed as bullish.</li>
<li>Entry: Price moves above a moving average in the current time frame
    (red line in Figure 1) with a higher high, low, and close (HLC). As
    illustrated in Figure 1, the two bars circled.</li>
<li>Exit: Crossing below a regular moving average (blue dotted line).</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="EURUSD setup" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-07-19-EURUSD.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the setup itself is simple. Less than a fifth of the
source code is devoted to the entry and exit. Most of this strategy
involves <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-automatic-position-sizing/">automated position sizing</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-not-letting-profit-turn-to-losses-with-a-breakeven-stop/">risk management to not let profits turn into losses</a>.</p>
