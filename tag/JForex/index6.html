            <div class="article-content"> <p>There is only two more trading days left in the April <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/">Dukascopy</a>
JForex Strategy Contest. I am currently ranked 6th. But there's a fierce
fight for my spot. I've been moving between 6th and 8th all week even
though I haven't made any trade. The other people are putting on big
bets hoping to squeeze in a top 6. Why? According to the winning prize
structure, the 4th to 6th winners will each receive \$1,000. Whereas the
7th to 10th will each receive \$500 only. With my current account
standing at \$120,032 (20% gain) this month, it is quite viable for
others to try to take my spot. See the table below for the top 10
standings as of this writing.</p>
<p><img alt="April standing 2 days before close" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-04-29-contestranking.png" /></p>
<p>My options are to either fire up my strategy to make more trades or do
nothing. The risk in running my strategy again is that I might lose
money and make myself even less competitive. My strategy's working
timeframe is in hours, so there isn't much room for error. As such, I
feel that with only two days of trading left, time is not on my side.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I will probably lose out my 6th spot as I am not far
away from others behind me. So if I do nothing, I will most likely end
up 7th or 8th and lose half the prize money.</p>
<p>After pondering about this briefly, I've decided to do nothing. The odds
are just too much against me. I have seen too many people in this
month's contest risking to move up from a good rank only to expose
themselves too much and lose out of the top 10 completely.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I found out that the competing strategy in the Dukascopy JForex Strategy
Contest doesn't need to be 100% automatic! According to <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/forex/jforex/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=4771&amp;sid=2ff0fd1b7645652d5f57821451586b08">Contest Support
in the official forum</a>, I can set parameters like take profit target,
stop loss, and long-only or short-only trades. That make this contest
substantially easier to program as I can implement a semi-automatic
strategy, which is what I prefer in my real trading. The problem with
building an automated trading system is that market conditions change
frequently and without notice. Thus, it takes more than a few lines to
program a consistently profitable system to filter out undesirable
conditions. As I discussed before, because all winners in this contest
have to publish their source codes, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reading-the-fine-print-for-dukascopy-jforex-strategy-contest/">I don't want to spend too much time
on this contest</a>. Now that I know I can trade semi-automatically in
this contest. I can just do my analysis manually and then use the
strategy to execute trades when I so desire. That is exactly like <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-is-your-trading-process/">my
real trading process</a> as illustrated before. As you can imagine, I am
very happy of this news. I don't need to scratch my head anymore to
build a new strategy for next month's contest. I programmed and tested
several new ideas in the past 2 weeks but haven't found anything better
than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-explanation-of-my-keltner-channel-and-candlestick-hybrid-setup/">my existing strategy</a>, which has been doing well in April. This
Dukascopy JForex Strategy Contest has been a great incentive for me to
become familiar with JForex. As I intend to use it for my <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">real trading
at Dukascopy</a> (open an account with this affiliate link to receive 35%
rebate on commissions) later this year, this is a win-win situation for
me as I learn the API and possibly win some prize money at the same
time.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am building my real JForex automated trading system one feature at a
time. The idea is to automate some of my most fundamental trading
techniques on JForex so that I can trade forex semi-automatically on
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a>. I am starting off here with a simple stop management
strategy. In a nutshell, once the market price moves in your favour
equidistant from your original stop loss, this strategy moves the stop
to breakeven. For example, if I go long EURUSD at 1.3500 with a stop at
1.3400 (100 pips stop). Then if the price breaks above 1.3600 (100 pips
profit), the strategy moves the stop to breakeven. This is a simplistic
implementation of the saying that "never let profits turn into losses".

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is an explanation of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/systems/">automated trading</a> strategy for the
Dukascopy JForex Strategy Contest in April. This strategy just made its
first trade today after running for about 72 hours. My contest demo
account closed with a gain of 7% on this first trade. Note that this
strategy is built for competing in a contest and not for real trading
(i.e., it's purely a no cost gamble). Here is the concept for this high
probability trading setup. Referring to Figure 1 below, the red arrow
marks my short entry on EURGBP today. These are the technical analysis
indicators the strategy uses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trend: Signaled by 50 bar moving average above (bullish) or below
    (bearish) the 200 bar moving average.</li>
<li>Momentum: Oversold or overbought RSI conditions, but not used in a
    traditional manner...</li>
<li>Volatility: I use the Keltner channel to measure volatility.</li>
<li>Price action: Observe candlestick behaviour to identify trend
    continuation. This is where the secret to this strategy happens. I
    will explain this below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that I used a Bollinger Bands in the chart of Figure 1 because I
couldn't find the Keltner Channel indicator in Metatrader (my charting
software). It doesn't affect my conceptual illustration anyhow. The
setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify overarching trend via 50/200 moving averages as explained
    above.</li>
<li>Confirm price is still playing to the trend by checking if current
    market price is on the right side of the 200 bars moving average.
    Price above for bullish and below for bearish.</li>
<li>Once steps 1-2 are in place, it's assumed that the trend is strong.
    We look for a setup in the trend's direction. In particular, we look
    for a <em>failed counter-trend retracement</em> setup using candlestick in
    combination with the Keltner channel.</li>
<li>Sounds fancy but it's simple. Using a short-side example, the bar's
    high has to penetrate above the Keltner channel yet it closes within
    it. Then the short entry is signaled. The opposite for a long-side
    entry.</li>
<li>RSI overbought and oversold conditions are used to filter out slow
    and steady counter-trend moves (those are evil).</li>
</ol>
<p>Another benefit of using a price channel is that I also use it to peg my
take profit target and stop loss. As I said in my previous post, because
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> expects winning contestants to submit their source codes,
I am not using anything proprietary or extraordinary here. As such, this
is totally different than <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/trading-strategy/">what I use to trade on my own</a>. Namely more
reliance on indicators and less on price action and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">risk management</a>.</p>
