            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I ported <a href="http://engineering-returns.com/tsi/">Engineering Return's Trend Strength Index</a> to JForex as my
first practice to writing custom indicators in JForex. Frank's code in
TradeSignal consists of 9 lines. My JForex code? 191. This is my first
custom indicator in JForex. It will also be the last. A compiled
programming language such as Java is not the most convenient to use for
data analysis. The lack of interactivity because of the step of
compilation is one obstacle to fluent data explorations. Secondly, the
language itself is more cumbersome because of its generality. Java is
used to build all sorts of applications. Contrary to something like
MatLab, in which it is purposely built to work with numbers. I miss <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/starting-to-use-matlab-for-quantitative-finance/">the
days when I have my license for MatLab</a>. However, being forced away
from MatLab might not be a bad thing. As much as I've become accustomed
to it, MatLab isn't without its flaws. But I won't bash it in this post.
What I actually want to talk about is R. The rage these days in
statistical data analysis is in R (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29">Wiki entry on R</a>). I've done
some research and testing, R is really as good as they say it is (see
past publications in <a href="http://www.rinfinance.com/">R/Finance conference</a><a href="http://probability.ca/cran/doc/contrib/Farnsworth-EconometricsInR.pdf"></a>). You will get to see
some real examples in financial time series data analysis in R later in
this blog once I have some publishable results. This will no doubt take
some time as I am learning yet another new programming language (thus
the lack of posts this week). The plan from now on is to use R to play
with the data. Then once the algorithm is finalized, I will either port
it to Java (JForex) for deployment or <a href="http://www.rforge.net/rJava/">embed the R environment in
Java</a> for live trading.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have won first place in the August <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy</a> JForex contest! My
automated strategy returned over 45% in the month of August. With that
honour comes <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/contests/strategy_contest/august-2010/">a \$5,000 grand prize</a> in real greenbacks. The setup
that I used is a minor updated version of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-dual-timeframe-moving-averages-setup/">the one I used last month</a>.
I continue to adapt my system to expect market conditions of the month
ahead. Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong. This contest is turning
out to be more than a nerdy pass time for me as I have finished in the
top 10 three times already since it started in April. However, I must
reiterate the fact that this is not real trading. It's just a paper
trading contest with no real money risked on my part. If I'm really that
good at trading to make 45% of return a month, I wouldn't be writing
this post at lunch in my cubicle at this moment. So yes, back to reality
as I continue my engineering work while improving my own trading and
developing my quantitative trading system in my spare time. As my blog's
tagline reads, this is an engineer's training to trade for a living.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Proper position sizing is an integral part of risk management. It <em>can</em>
be one of the easiest thing to do too. For example, I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/reducing-overall-market-exposure-according-to-market-volatility/">typically size my
trading position</a> based on the following factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amount of capital willing to put at risk.</li>
<li>Stop price level.</li>
<li>Volatility of the instrument.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following JForex code calculates a lot size based on these three
factors. It is part of my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sixth-place-finish-in-the-dukascopy-jforex-july-strategy-contest/">Dukascopy JForex July strategy</a> (complete
source code to the strategy is available via that link). [java
firstline="232"] private double getLot(Instrument instrument) throws
JFException { double riskAmt; double lotSize = 0; riskAmt =
this.acctEquity * (this.riskPct / 100d); // CCYUSD only lotSize =
riskAmt / (this.atr[instrument.ordinal()] * this.atrFactor); lotSize /=
1000000d; // in millions return roundLot(lotSize); } [/java] Referring
to line 237, riskAmt is the amount of capital to put at risk for a trade
(#1). Line 238 calculates lotSize, which is the position size that we
want. The denominator in that division is the distance of the stop in
pips. The strategy uses a multiple of ATR to set the stop loss. Nothing
fancy here. Lines 240--241 are to set the lotSize value according to the
JForex API specification. In which the lot amount is in millions and in
steps of a thousand units, or 0.001 step size. As I've noted in the
code, the caveat to this implementation is that the secondary currency
of the instrument and your account currency needs to be in U.S. dollar.
However, it's just a matter of conversion to extend this method for
other currencies. Update: I expanded on this functionality in the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jfutil-an-open-source-jforex-utilities-library/">JFUtil open source project</a>.</p>
