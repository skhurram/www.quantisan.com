            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Continuing on from Part 1 of this series: <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/getting-started-learning-jforex-programming/">Getting started learning
JForex programming</a>, now we're ready to discuss the real thing. You
build JForex strategies by using the IStrategy Interface (<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html">What is an
Interface?</a>). Basically, an Interface is a code skeleton with a set of
predefined empty methods that you'll need to implement yourself. The six
standard methods of the IStrategy Interface are:</p>
<ol>
<li>onStart</li>
<li>onStop</li>
<li>onMessage</li>
<li>onAccount</li>
<li>onTick</li>
<li>onBar</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is an empty IStrategy Interface implementation, also known as a
JForex strategy. This code will compile fine in JForex and you can even
run it. But it doesn't do anything at all because there is no code to
run in each of the methods. Each of the six methods will just be called
and exit immediately.</p>

<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Each of the method is triggered by a specific event. You can probably
guess what they are from their name.</p>
<h2>onStart (line 5)</h2>
<p>This is the first method that is called when you run your strategy. It
will run once and only once at the start of your strategy. Normally you
do your initialization in here. The thing to note for onStart is in line
5 of the code. The method signature of onStart is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">onStart</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">IContext</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="n">JFException</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The object
in the parameter and given to you in this method is an IContext object.
If IStrategy is the skeleton, then IContext is the heart of the
strategy. Please take a look at this <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/com/dukascopy/api/IContext.html">javadoc link to IContext</a> to see
what this object does. <strong>Javadoc?</strong>: Now is a good time to introduce the
second of the three essential resources of a JForex programmer. The
<a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/">JForex Javadoc</a> is the single most up-to-date API documentation
<em>explaining</em> each and every object and methods of the JForex API. Think
of it like a reference manual. Note that although it's comprehensive,
most of the explanation is very sparse and possibly incomplete. IContext
is a core JForex object to access many important components of the
JForex system, such as the ordering engine, charts, console,
indicators... You get the idea. It is important! You typically want to
keep a local copy of it as this is the only time (in onStart) that this
object will be passed to you in IStrategy.</p>
<h2>onStop (line 26)</h2>
<p>As the name suggest, this method is called once you send a stop command
to your strategy. You do your program wrap-up such as logging and
flushing data here. Not much out of the ordinary with this one.</p>
<h2>onMessage (line 18)</h2>
<p>Whereas we know when onStart and onStop will be called, onMessage is an
asynchronous method in that you don't know exactly when it will run.
This method is called when the Dukascopy server sends your strategy a
message. For example, the server calls onMessage to let you know that
your order has been filled. You receive and process the server message
by accessing the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/com/dukascopy/api/IMessage.html">IMessage object</a> that is passed to you.
<strong>Important:</strong>There is no guarantee that you will receive each and every
message sent to your strategy from the server. Perhaps your strategy
process is clogged. Or maybe your internet connection had a hiccup. If
your strategy onMessage doesn't get called by the server for whatever
reason, the server couldn't care less and won't be checking nor trying
again. So don't do anything critical like managing your orders in
onMessage!</p>
<h2>onAccount (line 22)</h2>
<p>This method is called whenever your account information update is
received. The method provides access to the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/client/javadoc/com/dukascopy/api/IAccount.html">IAccount object</a>, which
you use to get your account information. Say if you have an open
position, your account information changes on every tick because your
equity is cash + unrealized profit/loss. In that case, onAccount is
called every 5 seconds by the server at most to avoid flooding your
strategy. <strong>More Important:</strong>The IAccount object is not connected live
to your account in the server. It is merely a snapshot of your account.
For example, if you keep a local copy of an IAccount object. Do some
trading to change your balance. Then ask the same IAccount for account
balance information, you will not see a change. As such, always update
your local copy of IAccount within the onAccount method to keep your
account information up-to-date for your strategy's use.</p>
<h2>To be continued</h2>
<p>onStart, onStop, onMessage, and onAccount methods are <em>administrative</em>
methods for your strategy. The last two methods that we'll discuss,
onTick and onBar, is where the magic happens in a strategy. I am saving
the best for last in the next post.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The biggest problem I had when learning to program my own trading
strategies in JForex is finding where to start learning. There were few
JForex documentation available at the time and I had to teach myself
through painstaking trial and error with the help of Dukascopy's
technical support. Things have certainly changed for the better as a
JForex community is starting to sprout and documentation for it is at
least sufficient to get anyone started. This post is the first of a
series of quick beginner's guide to learning JForex programming by
putting all these resources in a tutorial.</p>
<h2>JForex is a Java tool</h2>
<p>JForex is actually not a programming language. It is an application
programming interface (API) for use with the standard Java programming
language. As such, the first step to learning to program in JForex is to
learn Java. Luckily, Java is one of the most popular programming
languages. So there're plenty of resources on and off the web to learn
Java programming. Some examples of free online tutorials are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/">The Java Tutorials</a> -- This is an official tutorial from the
    developer of Java themselves. Highly recommended.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.roseindia.net/java/beginners/">Beginners Java Tutorial</a> -- More geared for the absolute
    beginners to programming.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you prefer a book, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596009208?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=quantisan-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596009208">Head First Java, 2nd
Edition</a>. I brushed up on my Java from this book. Don't dwell on
Java too much though as you only need to know the basics to get started
with JForex. Just read a few chapters to understand the Java syntax and
then move on. You can always refer back to them later.</p>
<h2>Diving into JForex</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">JForex Wiki</a> is one of the three essential resources for JForex
programmers. I will be referring to some specific pages of the Wiki in
much of this series of posts. If you haven't done so already, <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">signup
for a DEMO account at Dukascopy</a>. Then launch the JForex platform and
follow the instructions on the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Use_in_JForex">Use in JForex</a> wiki page to assemble
your first JForex strategy!</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>So far so good? By this point, I hope you can understand basic Java
source code and know how to start/open, compile, and run a JForex
strategy. In the next post in this learning JForex series, we will
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/anatomy-of-a-jforex-strategy-part-1/">study the anatomy of a JForex strategy</a>.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>JFUtil is a Quantisan.com open-source project focused on reusable JForex
trading strategy components. Latest version is 2.1.3 released on April
8, 2011. Please <a href="#download">keep your local JFUtil library up to date</a> for the
latest patches and features.</p>
<h2>Main Features</h2>
<p><strong>1. Access to IContext and IAccount from anywhere in your project files.</strong> 
The one and only JForexContext object in JFUtil is a
thread-safe, singleton object which can be called from anywhere within
your projects, across any class file. No need to declare global IContext
variables. No need to pass it around in parameters. </p>
<p><strong>2. Simplify order submission with ticket builder.</strong> 
Set your trade order parameters with
an order ticket object using a builder constructor. You can build ticket
with as few or as many parameters as you like. All with intuitive method
names in the same ticket class. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">OrderTicket</span>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>My cheapskate EC2 experiment has been running well for two days. The
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">t1.micro EC2 cloud server instance ran smoothly</a> for over 48 hours
continuously. I was starting to believe that it's possible to run a
desktop trading system on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/rev-your-trading-system-on-the-cloud-with-a-free-amazon-cloud-server/">Amazon's free offer</a>. Then this happened
this morning on the third day of the experiment. </p>
<p><img alt="EC2 t1.micro" src="http://www.quantisan.com/static/images/img_archive/2010-11-10_ec2desktop.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Micro instance cloud
server experienced a processing hiccup and was never able to recover.
This is it for running a desktop trading system on a t1.micro. The
cheapest instance of Amazon EC2 is not enough to handle the load. The
only way to get this working is to run in a command-line only mode by
using the JForex API without the client platform or desktop. All that
eye-candy isn't useful anyway on a remote server. Update: I'm wondering
if it's the screensaver that caused the problem. I am now turning the
screensaver off and trying this again. Update 2: No, it looks like it
really is JForex overloading the system.</p> </div>

of the desktop (left of the clock). This took so many hours for me to
figure out. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/first-time-setting-up-jforex-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">Squeezing so much into so little power</a>. Below is the
bash script that I made to get this working. If you want to run this
yourself, here's <a href="">a tutorial on how to run user scripts to initialize an
EC2 instance</a>. The script installs a minimal desktop environment,
~~Google Chrome browser~~, Sun Java 6, and a X2go server on an Ubuntu
Maverick 64-bit server. That's all you need, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>Note that this script is a

manually through SSH. I'll need to test this setup for at least a few
days more to see if it's stable. Once it's confirmed usable, I'll write
up a proper tutorial for anyone else interested in exploiting <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/rev-your-trading-system-on-the-cloud-with-a-free-amazon-cloud-server/">this free

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p><span>I bumped into a myriads of obstacles setting up the
<span>JForex</span> trading platform on an </span><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/rev-your-trading-system-on-the-cloud-with-a-free-amazon-cloud-server/">Amazon AWS's free
t1.micro<span> <span>intance</span></span></a>. I will go through the
steps I went through to setup a cloud server for JForex in this post. In
the end, I find out that the t1.micro instance chokes up from running
the GNOME desktop environment on Ubuntu Maverick. I enabled Amazon's
CloudMonitor utility and the CPU measurement is locked at 100% from
running the JForex platform and the desktop. This is expected as I
suspected that the t1.micro wouldn't be able to handle all that graphics
display. I chose to run Ubuntu on EC2 because that's what I'm familiar
with at home. I also considered running CentOS because it is legendary
as an enterprise server. Yet I read reviews from individuals running
their own private VPS saying that <a href="http://knol.google.com/k/tom-harrison/centos-vs-ubuntu/24f5zicu9nl0z/1">CentOS is very secure but it is too
"tight-assed"</a>. As JForex needs a relatively recent commercial Sun
Java version to run, I chose a easier Linux distro for my EC2 instance.
A minor gripe I have with Ubuntu is that their EBS Amazon Machine Image
(AMI) comes in 15 GB. Whereas the free offer from Amazon only provides
10 GB of free EBS use. So there's a 5 GB extra that will be charged on a
monthly basis. This has been discussed on the developer forum and it
looks as though <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-on-ec2/+bug/670161">subsequent versions of Ubuntu release AMI will be in
10GB</a>. However, this 5 GB amounts to only \$0.55 a month. Still, I
want free! I started out my trial on EC2 using the server variant of
Ubuntu. It has less clutter and potentially more secure than the regular
desktop variant. However, getting remote desktop running on the server
took me two evenings to figure out! My problem is in getting a NX server
to work. I tried the commercial, but free, <a href="http://www.nomachine.com/">nxserver from NoMachine</a>.
I tried the GPL implementation, <a href="http://freenx.berlios.de/">FreeNX</a>. And I tried Google's open
source adaptation, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/neatx/">Neatx</a>. It just wouldn't work! As soon as I solved
one problem something else breaks. At first it was an <a href="http://www.jsiegel.com/2008/06/installing-nx-on-amazons-ec2-centos.html">authentication
problem</a> because the SSH keys were mixed between the NX server and SSH
server. Then once that's resolved, the desktop just wouldn't start and
without any error message to tell me what's wrong. That's when I gave up
on NX and switched to using <a href="http://www.x2go.org">X2go</a>. It only took me a few minutes to
install X2go. It ran fine fresh from installation. So many hours wasted
on NX. Once I had my remote desktop running, I tried to install Sun Java
for JForex. After a few failed attempts, I found out about <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/+bug/634487">this
problem</a>. Apparently there's a kernel bug on Ubuntu in which
installing Sun Java on a t1.micro would crash the installer. Just my
luck. By then my curiosity waned and it's just a matter of getting the
job done. So I restarted the whole setup process yet another time with a
Ubuntu 10.10 desktop edition (has been using server edition) 64-bit (to
circumvent the Sun Java installation bug), installed Sun Java, Google
Chrome, and X2go. Logged in to the remote desktop through X2go. Launched
Chrome to access the <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/ibentry.php?ibref=1143/">Dukascopy website</a>. Started JForex. It takes
only a few minutes once I know what I'm doing. Then I watched the
t1.micro instance come to a crawl. There's my first attempt at running
JForex on a free t1.micro. My recommendation? <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">Don't do it</a>.</p> </div>
