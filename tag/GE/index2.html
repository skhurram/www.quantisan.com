            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I ditched my GE calls at the open today when the S&amp;P 500 made a gap up
and GE gapped open at \$11.10. These options were purchased at 0.49. So
that's a loss of \$56.35 + \$15 for commission. However, I'm definitely
out too early as GE is hanging around \$11.50 as I'm writing this.</p>
<p>The reason for this quick exit is because the long weekend starts
tomorrow so the options premium is sure to drop. Since I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-5-ge-100-apr-09-11-put-79/">cleared my
puts for GE on Tuesday</a> already, I'm out of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">my GE strangle</a>
entirely now.</p>
<p>In addition to a bad entry on my part, the time decay really ate up my
premiums. I should review the details of this trade another time. I am
off to a long weekend soon.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm out the short side of my GE strangle. I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">purchased these puts at
0.872</a>. I loss about \$41 for this trade alone. Doesn't look too bad,
but remember, I still have my calls to get rid of, and those are the
real losers. I'm down \$172 for the calls at this moment.</p>
<p>The reason for ditching my GE puts now is simply because it is refusing
to go down. In fact, it is outperforming the market for the last few
days even as we're retracing in the market, see Figure 1.<em>If a ship is
refusing to sink in a storm, it is surely a sign of strength.</em> GE has
filled a gap with low volume, Figure 2. It could very well shoot back up
from here.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is a long weekend and there's probably going to be
little action all week. The <strong>time decay is going to really hurt me</strong> as
we approach expiration soon. It has been dropping steadily already. Time
is definitely not on my side for this trade. So I've decided to ditch it
on signs of strength of GE.</p>
<p>At this point, I would like to clear this off of my desk and look for a
re-entry.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Despite <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/end-of-month-review-march-is-bear-rally-month/">my pessimism</a>, I think this bear rally may have steam to go
even farther up in this run before the final flush down. Here're my
reasons.</p>
<p>​1. We have touched the 38% Fibonacci retracement level precisely last
week and have been making higher lows. See Figure 1.</p>
<p>​2. As I noted in the morning, the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/end-of-month-review-march-is-bear-rally-month/">up days have noticeably more volumes
than the down days</a> in this rally.</p>
<p>​3. My two favourite shorts, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">GE</a> and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-1-gs-100-apr-09-105-put-955/">GS</a>, are resisting to stay
below their supports. In particular, Figure 2 shows that even in today's
swinging moves, they closed above their intra-day supports at noon while
the S&amp;P 500 broke its intraday support at noon, just barely. In fact,
today's move look a lot like <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-277-tck-487/">TCK when it retraced</a> (and when I
unloaded), just to punch through to much higher later. If that's any
indication, these two (and the market) will be breaking their long term
resistances within days.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>As I was saying this morning, I placed an order before going to work for
a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/general-electric-the-next-aig/">Apr09 11/10 strangle on General Electric</a> (GE). My limit was at
\$1.31 (total) but the morning mark started at \$1.37 and kept creeping
up. I waited until 10 am and GE slowly gained in price. It stayed above
\$11 shortly and so I checked the strangle price on the 12/11 instead.
It was about \$1.40 too. So I just changed my order from 11/10 to 12/11
and upped my limit to meet the mid spread.</p>
<p>The risk profile for 12/11 is definitely different than 11/10. 11/10
would have been a good neutral position because GE is obviously
congested around the \$10.xx range. The 12/11 range is more short-heavy
because GE was only around \$11.07 when I entered. It's at the top of a
trading range. However, I took it anyway because I'm actually leaning to
the short side, in case you haven't noticed...</p>
<p>As you can see from Figure 1, daily on left and weekly on right, \$10.5
is a major long term pivot point. We are testing it at the moment on
weak volumn. Figure 2 shows the hourly on left and daily on right. As I
was saying this morning, GE's rally in March looks weaker as compared to
S&amp;P 500. The 10d MA haven't even crossed the 40d MA yet. Add to that,
last time the indicators were at this almost overbought level was last
year in the \$15 range. You can see what happened to that afterward. GE
skidded down to \$6.</p>
<p>However, we have broken that long term downtrend, see Figure 3. And
we're forming a long flag. This is definitely a glaringly bullish sign.
After all, we can't keep using the same channel forever.</p>
<p>Rather long or short, the important point is that GE is at a major
junction right now. Although I'm favouring the short side, but from
observing the action of the market in the past few days, there's also a
good chance GE will get lifted along with the rest of the market soon.
That's why I've put on a strangle to take advantage of both the long and
the short prospects.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>On another note,<a href="http://xtrends.blogspot.com/2009/03/what-will-be-different-this-time.html">xTrends pointed to GE</a> as being a great upcoming
short play. Look at the long term chart below, daily on left and weekly
on right.</p>
<p>First on the daily to the left, we have increasing price and decreasing
volume since the climb from the bottom. Stochastic is making a bearish
crossover in the upper half (would have been nice if it's higher). And
every time it does that in the past year, GE goes sliding down. Volume
weighted MACD is also showing a negative divergence. GE is stalling
above \$10 but its V-MACD is higher than previously in the \$10 zone.</p>
<p>As for the weekly chart on the right, it's obvious GE is in a major
downtrend. And so is everything else. However, compared to the S&amp;P 500
it is certainly lagging on this recent rally in the past month or so.
That is certainly a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>Update: I like it enough that I've <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-5-strangle-ge-100-apr-09-1211-callput-137/">entered a strangle order for GE
around \$10-11</a>. It's going to pop one way or the other.</p>
