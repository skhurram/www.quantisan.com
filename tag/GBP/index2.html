            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>GBP/JPY finally broke below an intermediate term wedge pattern formed
from Dec 30. See Figure 1 for the daily chart. I am noticeably late in
this GBP/JPY short entry because I was preoccupied with other positions
(e.g. <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/closed-eurchf-and-gbpchf-shorts-best-trade-ever/">my EUR/CHF and GBPCHF shorts</a>) today. In any case, this is an
intermediate term (a few days at least) play so there is no rush. My
first short was executed at 146.51 on obvious signs of short term pound
weakness versus the GBP/CHF pairs. GBP/JPY made some retracement on a
test of 146.00 but GBP/CHF kept on dropping, so I took a short position
once it touched the 146.50 resistance. My average price in this is
146.32. I have set my stop loss to lock in some profits already (which
might get taken out soon). Note that I just happened to be watching the
GBP/CHF currency pair as I have a position on shorting that too.
Otherwise EUR/GBP and GBP/USD would have been better for short-term
intermarket analysis because of higher liquidity. With regard to this
formation, as you can see on Figure 1, today's break of 147.50 gave way,
all the way, down to 143.00. This target price is estimated from the
height of the wedge pattern which it just broke through. The distance
from 147.50 to 143.00 is about the distance of the height of the wedge
(Dec 29th low to 30th high). Another reason for targeting this 143.00
price is because of my weekly chart of Figure 2. 142.50-143.00 is the
next support according to a long term trendline (lowest ascending white
line) as shown in Figure 2. GBP/JPY haven't seen these prices for a good
month, so hopefully the move down shouldn't be too difficult. As usual,
I will <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/how-to-stockpile-a-trade-position-one-step-at-a-time/">stockpile my short position</a> in this gradually to limit risk.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Having had <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-bad-eurusd-day-trading-and-what-to-do-about-it/">a hard time day trading the EUR/USD last week</a>, things
haven't been well for me this week either with the market in a gridlock.
My one and only viable setup so far is <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftcs/">built for a trending market</a>.
So this range-bound market is new territory for me as I experiment (in
hindsight, haphazardly) to come up with more profitable forex trading
setups. As you can imagine, trading without discipline is a recipe for
diaster. I have given back all the paper gain from this month by the
start of this week and is treading on thin ice with my demo account
dipping dangerously close to the November opening balance. Needless to
say, I do not want to see my account in the red for this month. But that
is what happened after today's string of failed trades. I am officially
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/trade-log/">in the red for this month</a>, for now. While there are several mistakes
I made resulting in this mess, I think it all boils down to one flaw in
my trading this week. Yes, those day trading stints I did surely have
put a dent in my demo account, but what's worse is that I've
unconsciously have let those losses affect my trading mentality. These
losses were stuck in my mind and my mental "goal" for this week was
recovering from them. However, I have approached the problem in the
wrong way by not wanting to lose anymore in my account. In other words,
I was afraid of losing. So how did that materially affect my trading?
Here is a simple example as illustrated in my order history on the
GBP/JPY chart attached at the bottom of this post. The 3 yellow
triangles are my short entries and the 3 red dots marks the stopped
exits. According to my setup, my original entry at 149.50 had a stop at
150.50. But I moved my stop closer to 149.80 in the morning because I
didn't want to risk more. That got taken out easily as 149.80 is within
the congestion zone. Then I tried to short it a couple more times with
tight stops because I see the downside potential to be still intact.
Those were eaten up alive too and now I don't have a position because it
would have been more foolish to keep trying in vain. While just 3 trades
wouldn't have done much damage, I was doing the same thing across the
board in shorting CAD/JPY and EUR/CAD. A few here and a few there. They
add up to a bad day. As of this writing, it looks like these pairs are
finally moving in my direction. But instead of being patient with
reasonable stops, I thought I could do better and micro-managed my
positions to end up taking multiple small losses and with nothing left
on the table to ride the move. So what is the correct way of following
up on a dent in the account? I should have done the following instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce risk exposure by limiting trade size or overall opened
    positions until I am back up.</li>
<li>Focus on what I did wrong last week and stop doing that, i.e. no
    more day trading.</li>
<li>Recall my best trades and do more of that, i.e. my one and only
    finalized setup, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/an-introduction-to-my-forex-trend-continuation-setup-ftc/">FTC</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not so coincidentally, now that I'm in the deepest drawdown ever, this
is as good as ever to put this emergency recovery procedure into
practice.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well, that descending trendline didn't last long for GBP/USD. I shorted
it when it was testing it and saw that the RSI was at a prior high too
(Fig. 1). I placed my order just below the short-term ascending support
to hope for a break to the downside, see Fig. 2. GBP/USD consolidated
around that short-term support for a few hours and has now broken upward
to a strong resistance at 1.6600. It's the top of a previous congestion
zone, highlighted rectangle in Fig. 1. GBP/USD at 1.666 is a very
tempting short, but never short a new high, as my rules say. So I'm
gonna wait for a few more hours with this and see how it goes. Position
size: 50% Entry: 1.634 Stop: 1.645, stopped out. Target: 1.6100 Reward /
Risk = 240 / 110 = 2.2 \&lt; 3, so only 50% position. I think I'll stick
with the 3 factor as a limit. Even these 2+ trades aren't working so
well for me because my probability of success has been low.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>It looks as though my analysis for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-gbpjpy-in-142-861-stop-141-16/">GBP/JPY making a reversal</a> was
correct. However, my short term entry needed to be improved for me to
profit on my intermediate term analysis. In particular, I should have
looked at a major short term resistance line instead of an arbitrary
weak resisitance line as I did when I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-gbpjpy-in-142-861-stop-141-16/">entered the long
previously</a>. That didn't go so well as I was
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-stopped-out-gbpjpy-141-70-116-10-pips/">stopped out soon afterward</a> when GBP/JPY was consolidating. In
hindsight, if I'm to try for a reversal, at least wait for the price to
break a strong short term resistance and then use the recent low as the
stop. The preferred resistance line for GBP/JPY in this missed trade can
be seen in Fig. 1, which I drew many days ago and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-gbpjpy-in-142-861-stop-141-16/">also can be
seen</a> in my previous entry (Figure 2 on that
page, the higher of the 2 lines). New Figure 2 attached below shows the
bigger picture of GBP/JPY in a daily chart to see what could have
perspired. My target of 148 was spot on too!</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>Just got back from a long weekend and found that <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-50-long-gbpjpy-in-142-861-stop-141-16/">my GBP/JPY long</a> is
stopped out for a loss of -\$40.63. It looks like the resistance is
holding up from the looks of Figure 1. This setup is toasted for now.
GBP/JPY 140.00 - 143.00 is the range for the time being. However, I
still think 141.70 is an important pivot. I'll need to wait and see
which way does it go though. On the other hand, <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-eurjpy-long-100-129-99-stop-128-80/">my EUR/JPY long</a> is
doing well and I'm still riding it. EUR/JPY broke through a previous
resistance at 131.50 and shot through 132.00. I have moved my stop up to
131.50 to lock in some profit.</p>

GBP/JPY long trade. I entered on market at 142.861 last night with a 50%
position size. The 141.00 support seems to be holding so far, see Fig.
1. Also the RSI have been way oversold (best in my basket of pairs) and
it has now broken above the RSI 30 line (Fig. 1). In the short term,
GBP/JPY broke a resistance line at 142.60 when I entered this position.
However, it has since retraced back below it to a support from the day
before. So there's no short-term confirmation yet. Position size: 50%
