            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>S&amp;P is up 50+ points today. We gapped up at the open, stayed in a
trading range for the day, then slowly rose up in the last hour, but
only to lose a small chunk and settled at 850, again. The volume has
been low throughout the day and the internals didn't look too good.
That's what prompted me to unload about half my positions in the last 45
minutes. The recent beating in my account certainly is making me being
very cautious now. I'd rather <strong>save my ammo to enter higher later when
we get confirmation for a rally than wait for one with bloated bullish
positions</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at the S&amp;P 500, TICK, and Advance-Decline line. Aside from the
open gap up peak, both the TICK and A-D line failed to impress
throughout the day. Actually, it was lack of strength in the numerous
840 tests and the weak 850 breakout about 3:20 that worried me. Notice
the lower lows in both the TICK and A-D line at the 840 and 850
breakouts in the chart below.</p>

<p>The first to go was -90 DELL @ 9.90 at 3:25pm for about a 50% loss. I
[bought DELL at the beginning of October for \$16.49][] and it has been
underperforming throughout the two months. There's been little volume
since I bought, up or down. Even with the exuberant buying on the market
today, DELL failed to break above \$10 (it did close at \$10.14). Most
important reason for me selling this long term holding now is that
there's very little volume even on this up day when everyone's expecting
a real bear rally.</p>

<p>Next up, I sold my <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">C calls from the strangle placed Friday</a>. As I
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-100-uyg-449/">said earlier in the day</a>, the news that the FED is bailing out
Citigroup has rocketed its share price from \$3.17 at my time of
purchase to \$6.50 on the morning rush. However, C share price eased
down throughout the day and failed to break \$6 with high volume. I sold
at about \$6.05. I purchased the <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/bought-2-strangle-c-100-dec-08-525-callput-162/">+2 Dec 5 calls for \$0.79</a> and sold them for \$1.77. This was a
speculative play and I didn't want to be greedy. So I sold when C share
price showed it's lacking steam to continue to move up ahead.</p>

<p>Lastly, I sold my [+2 ABB Dec 10 calls purchased at \$1.55][] for
\$1.70. A breakeven trade after commission. The drawdown was humongous
in this trade since I have <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-need-for-trailing-stop-expired-november-2008-options-post-hoc-review/">missed some previous stops</a>. The ABB share
price action is a lot like DELL today, a lot of fireworks but no real
substance. Yes, the price is up a lot today, but there's no volume from
it. In particular, in the last 15 minute, ABB dived back down to its
major pivot point of \$11.10. I quickly unloaded my calls then.</p>

<p>Like everyone else, I am really hoping for a good bear rally. It would
do everyone, both bears and bulls, some good at this point. The thinking
is, after so many fake rallies lately, this one has to be it, right?
However, having learned my lesson in bottom picking in this bear market,
I'm putting my hope/logic aside and interpret what I see in front of me.
From today's price and volume movement, this rally doesn't seem like it
will follow through.</p>
<p>I do hope I'm wrong though, if we can hold the 845/840 level on the
S&amp;P500 tomorrow. Then I would be looking to add to my already 60% long
holdings.</p>

<p>Covered my [short put on DELL shorted at \$1.29][] yesterday now bought
back for \$1.80. A loss of 51 cents. That works out to about \$200 for
my position. Things didn't look good for DELL after it broke \$13. I
covered today at the open when we gapped up a bit. The open gap up
volume was low compared to its previous similar priced \$12 level. DELL
has been my weakest position so far. I might unload the rest of my
shares at a loss on the next rally.</p>
<p>Three main reasons for my cover, 1) uncomfortable with the position due
to price-volume weakness recently, 2) risk management in preparation for
a possible test of 870 and below on the S&amp;P, and 3) loading my ammo by
selling the underperformers and adding to my stronger positions on
weakness if we fall from here.</p>

<p>Looking like we're oversold on the market. DELL is holding up nicely
today despite the 30+ drop in S&amp;P. So I'm putting in a swing trade with
a short put Dec08 DELL 13 strike @ 1.29.</p>
<p>Upside: Strength in DELL shares (positive change) in light of a down
market today. Up volume seems slightly more than down volume for past
few days on DELL too. Broad market price weakness not supported by
intraday TICK and A-D line. Short term reversal expected.</p>
<p>Resistance: \$14 then primary at pre-crash low about \$15.</p>
<p>Downside: DELL price still in narrow trading range. We are not on the
high side in that range. General market rally not supported by volume
yet.</p>
<p>Support: Lower trading range of \$12.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Today's market weakness seems unsupported based on intraday
data. I entered this at about 974 on the S&amp;P 500 after touching 972.
This is a short term bullish position.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quantisan.com/breaking-down-of-this-weeks-trading-range/">Like the market</a>, my holdings are going sideway this week near their
lows. Based on the price/volume observation this week, here's my
short-term ranking from strong to weak.</p>
<ol>
<li>ESLR</li>
<li>DELL</li>
<li>CAF</li>
<li>SLW</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel ESLR is strongest because of the last hour spike last Friday on 1
million+ volume. They are now sueing Barclays and Lehman to return their
30.9 million loaned shares.</p>
<p></p>
DELL is showing some resilience despite negative news on Yahoo today. It
is testing its low the 2nd time at end-of-day today on a regular
late-day volume. The next day or two will be important times for DELL in
the short term.</p>
<p>CAF is just drifting sideway for now on low volume.</p>
<p>SLW is now under pressure because of weakness in precious metals and the
Euro.</p>

<p>It's time to <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/eslr-testing-long-term-low/">review my positions as promised last week</a>. After the
record up day on Monday and then the lackluster follow-through Tuesday,
today is probably going to be a down day in the markets. Given <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/mid-week-market-review-october-15-2008/">my
intermediate term outlook</a>, I am inclined to hold my positions.
However, I need to unload my weakest link to reduce my risk.</p>
<p>Above is a quick snapshot of my current holdings.</p>
<p>Notice that DELL and ESLR are holding on nicely on this down (DJX
-3.18%, SPX -3.57% as of this writing) day after the previous spike.
This is a very good sign indeed as it shows they're likly to hold on to
the previous \~20% gain, at least for now.</p>
<p>Actually, the price action of ESLR seem very healthy in particular.
There's been a couple of big volume spikes in late day trading. Although
it does seem to be in a constant downtrend, as you can see from its
chart.</p>
<p>As for CAF and SLW they are both below support at the moment. CAF has
broken its \$25 support last Friday and is trading below it at the
moment. SLW is definitely the weakest at the moment. If it isn't such a
cash cow, I would probably be selling it in yesterday's rally.
Furthermore, it still seems to be holding on to its decending support
line on the daily chart today.</p>

<p>At this point, the question I ask myself is, if I'm in all cash now,
would I be buying these companies at this point? CAF - yes, DELL - yes,
ESLR - yes, SLW - yes. Is this the bottom? I don't know. I'll just have
to wait and see. However, I will watch the day-to-day action of my
holdings carefully and unload one of two of them to reduce my risk.</p>

<p>In recent years, I've started to like Dell computers more and more.
Their laptops has been well priced and quality built (I don't have much
experience with their other products). Their recent introduction of the
Dell Mini 9, for example, shows great management on many levels. It is a
solid product that addresses the competitors' problems, at a competitive
price, and timed well for an entry when netbook is starting to prove to
be more than just a fad with real market potentials.</p>
<p>Dell is a company I'd like to hold for the long term just because I like
them so much.</p>
<p>Upside: PE at 12.32. Indicators buy setup, see daily graph. Michael Dell
bought \$100 million worth of shares above \$20 on Sept 4/5.</p>
<p>Resistance: Sept 19 high of around \$18.50</p>
<p>Downside: Recession, low demand, stiffer competitions. Taiwanese
computer manufacturers like Asus, Acer, and MSI are stepping into Dell's
territory.</p>
<p>Support: Sept 19 low of \$15.50</p>
<p>Bottom line: Just like their products, I feel that DELL offers real
value.</p>
