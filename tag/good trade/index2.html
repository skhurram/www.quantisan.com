                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-long-usdchf-1009-out-10245-155-pips/" rel='bookmark'>Paper trade: Long USD/CHF @ 1.009, out 1.0245 (+155 pips)</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>The U.S. dollar finally picked up some strength last Thursday and I
loaded to ride the trend. One of the earliest trade I made in this wave
is going long on USD/CHF. Figure 1 is taken today after a full week
since the initial move in USD. The vertical line marks the day when I
entered this trade on Thursday 22nd late afternoon. Here are my reasons
for making the entry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parity level 1.0000 was a mere 30 pips away from the low the day
    before</li>
<li>Obvious positive divergence on the indicator, Fig. 1.</li>
<li>Breakout on the shorter 3-hour timeframe, Fig. 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>I placed the order just above the resistance and beyond the short term
channel. The order was filled the next day in the morning on the 23rd.
In hindsight, I should have used a half position only and added to it
once it broke the longer term descending resistance as shown in Fig. 2.
That's because a short term break is a low probability move given that
the downtrend was strong. However, USD/CHF was testing parity, which is
as strong a support as you can find for many reasons. As you can see
from Fig. 2, the entry was rather good overall (could have been better
as discussed above). However, I think the exit was also a disciplined
move. My original target was 1.026 as noted below. It was just below
that horizontal resistance at 1.0267 which I marked on Fig. 1. Yet,
there's also the longer term trendline marked on both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.
I had 4-5 positions open at the time and this was one of my strongest
two (the other being CAD/JPY short), so I tried to add to my position
once the pair broke that longer term trendline. However, the line proved
to be strong as USD/CHF retraced and took out my stop as shown in Fig. 2
(red dot, 2nd from right). Nevertheless, the pair remained above 1.0200
and my core position was safe (I moved my stop up). But not all was
well. USD/CHF eventually broke 1.025 but it didn't go far. It printed a
couple more bars on the chart while I kept moving my stop closer and
closer. Also noting that the pair was short-term overbought, I moved my
stop right up to below 1.025 at 1.0245 to lock in most of the profit.
That stop was eventually taken out and the pair took a dive as shown in
Fig. 2. Moving the stop up tight in a short-term overbought condition
was a good choice. I learned this from my recent trades when I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-usdcad-all-out-1-0872-196-6-pips-and-1-0821-145-6-pips/">left
profits on the table</a>. So I got out against my hope for higher pips
even when the talk of USD making a return to strength was ubiquitous. I
traded what I saw and not what I hoped for, and against the opinions of
other people. If only my entry was a bit more patient, this would have
been one of my best executed trades. Below are the data for my entries.
Position size: 100% First Entry: 1.009 First Stop: 1.0030 First Target:
1.0260 Reward / Risk #1 = 170 / 60 = 2.8 \&lt; 3, but close enough. Second
Position Size: 25% Second entry/stop: 1.0232/1.0220 I didn't have a
target in mind for this addition because it was only to add on the
strength of the existing position.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I closed my successful EUR/JPY long just before the weekend with a tight
stop. Notice from Figure 1 that EUR/JPY is now in overbought territory.
In addition, a negative divergence is developing on the RSI from the
recent 2 peaks also at 135.00. The best thing about this trade was <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/paper-trade-eurjpy-long-100-129-99-stop-128-80/">my
entry</a>. However, I certainly didn't chop this setup the best I could.
Even though I rode this up for +500 pips, I only had a 50% position
size. There were two easily identifiable adding points which I could
have taken advantage of. When EUR/JPY broke above 132.00, which was a
clear short-term resistance, a day after my entry I should have added to
my position then because of short-term momentum. Another chance came at
132.50 or so. As shown in Figure 2, when the price retested the low end
of the channel at 132.50. Both of these opportunities would have
survived with my usual stop of 100 pips. Another disappointment was that
my second half of the position was stopped out shortly because I moved
my stop up too soon. I was confident enough when I placed the order to
enter a full position size. But my over-zealous need to reduce risk got
the better of me. I observed on a daily time frame but traded in the
3-hour. To be more accurate in pointing the finger, it was my lack of
patience that stopped out my other half of the position. Anyway, I did
rode the wave with a sufficient position size. One thing I just noticed
is the T formation in Figure 2. EUR/JPY is back to where it started a
month ago. Where it heads now is uncertain. I will keep an eye on this
pair and aim to re-enter another long in a few days. The trend is your
friend.</p>

<p>Finally! I have been waiting for a bear market rally for weeks! I
decided to go <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">full long after the bounce from 820 today</a>. Refer to
that post for <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sp-hit-820-backed-up-the-truck-and-loaded-on-more-slw-and-abb/">details of my entries</a>. In this post, I would like to discuss why the 820 bounce
gave me the confidence in going all in despite widespread fear and the
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/covered-slw-fro-and-wfc-short-puts/">many failed attempts</a> myself.</p>
<p>A quick recap of the past week's action. After the failed rally attempt
from 10/28 to 11/04, the market has been brutal to say the least. Any
strength failed to stir enthusiasm and has bled down slowly. The market
drifted down lower on little volume day after day. If I were to describe
the market, I'd say it looked like the last moment of a dying man. This
lack of will to move has certainly killed many bulls. I was one of them.
I have been stopped out a few times trying to catch this falling knife
(more like a grind). I even prepared to exit the last of my holdings if
we do break down from this point.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the day, the market looked like it's going to be
another down drift today. But being very near the 10/10 bottom already,
I know things are going to move one way or the other before the options
expiry next week. And since the Max Pain for the index options are at
least 10% higher, I am still looking for a reversal soon.</p>
<p>I mentally noted S&amp;P at 845 is an important level. It was the low of the
10/28 big rally day. The market skid on the 845 level all morning with
little volume. That was good because it is testing a support on low
volume. I had thought we may bounce from there.</p>
<p>Then I went to lunch just before noon.</p>
<p>When I got back after 1pm, the market has already broken down. However,
there are several bullish indication I noticed.</p>
<ol>
<li>the break down volume is higher than the previous bar (Figure 1),
    but it's still relatively low. Which means we don't have panic
    selling yet.</li>
<li>both the TICK and Advance-Decline line moving averages (Figure 2)
    are relatively healthy for such an important drop. Indicating no
    broad selling.</li>
<li>notice the unusual V shape for the TICK (Figure 2)? We even reached
    a new multi-day low of -1666. Yet #1 and #2 contradicts this
    seemingly panic selling, so this depression in price looked
    artificial to me</li>
</ol>
<p>Like how the recent rally attempts lacked enthusiasm, this break of 845
and test of 820 looked like it lacked enthusiasm too. Given that this is
such a major support level, odds are that we will bounce from here at
least for intraday. That is when I made my entry.</p>
<p></p>
Before 2pm, we broke 850, the low of yesterday, with the highest 30 min
volume of the week. That is when the rally looked strong to me and my
doubt of a bull trap eased. Frankly, I had some tight mental stops and
prepared to jump if things deteriorate like the many times before.</p>
<p>The day continued strong with price and volume confirmation. We closed
at the high with significant volume. We even reached 700 million volume
on SPY, a first since 10/16. I believe an intermediate bottom has been
set so I'll be looking at a longer timeframe (days) for my long
positions now.</p>
<p>First expected resistance from this move is 980 on the S&amp;P from the
trendline (Figure 1, right). Target is at least the 50 dma, we just
haven't touched it for 2 months. This is as good a time as ever to give
it a run for it.</p>
<p>Today is a great example of the need for critical thinking with a clear
head in light of a lot of pressure and past emotion. The beaten account,
the grim market movement, and the many stopped out trades has nearly
made me walk away for the week. But I remained focus on the market and
made my decision based on the price action.</p>
<p>Despite renewed optimism, I will continue to practice <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/trading-how-tos/risk-management/">prudent risk
management</a> and to eventually pocket at least most of the profit from
today, if not more.</p>
