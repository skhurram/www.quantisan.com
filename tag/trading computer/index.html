            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am waiting for a flight to Geneva. For a guy that works in an
unexciting cubicle, I seem to travel a lot. As Europe is the fourth
continent which I am visiting this year. (<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/my-interview-at-dukascopy-in-geneva/">More about this very exciting
trip</a> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">once I am
back</span>) The thing with travelling is that I will be away from my
development desktop, amongst other things of course. As I work a day job
and can only do my trading analysis and <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/category/quantitative-finance/">quant development work</a>
between the hours that I can squeeze in every day, every free minute is
precious. One productivity habit that I adapted from frequent travelling
is that I have a portable <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/what-is-your-trading-process/">workflow system</a> implemented. For the sake
of completeness by stating the obvious, there are three keys to being
productive while on the road.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exploiting downtime.</li>
<li>Being prepared.</li>
<li>Planning ahead.</li>
</ol>
<p>Being productive doesn't mean that I coup myself up in a hotel room to
work. Enjoying a foreign city and absorbing a different culture help
enhance my personal experience in the long run. Being productive means
exploiting down-times. The times waiting at an airport (like now), stuck
in a plane, the wee hours of the morning when you couldn't sleep because
of jet-lag, etc. Being prepared means have your work ready and
available. There are three free software/services that I can't live
without these days. They are Dropbox, Subversion, and SSH.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dropbox is a web-based file hosting and synchronizing service.
    Basically, after <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTYwMjg4MDY5/">installing the Dropbox software</a>, anything you
    put in your "My Dropbox" directory in your computer will be mirrored
    on their online server. Then you can install the Dropbox software in
    a second computer and choose to link your private dataset with this
    second computer. Thus the "My Dropbox" directory will be
    synchronized in real-time between these two (or more) computers and
    an online version. All your most important files will be up-to-date
    and available to you anywhere. No more need for USB drives.</li>
<li>A software version control system to keep track and backup my source
    code revisions. I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion">Apache Subversion</a> in particular. You can
    use Subversion to archive any file other than source code. For
    example, you can use it to keep track of revisions and branches to
    your presentation slides. [Assembla offers a free 2GB online private
    repository][] so that you can access it from anywhere and save the
    hassle of rolling your own repository server.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">Secure Shell</a> (SSH) is not a service like the other two but a
    network protocol. It is not as easy to setup so I'll leave it to
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+setup+SSH">Google</a>. I use it to securely and remotely access my main
    computer's file system or the desktop when necessary. A simpler
    alternative to SSH is to use <a href="http://www.LogMeIn.com%20">LogMeIn</a>, a remote desktop service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that some of these links are affiliate programs. But I just use
their free services, so I am only recommending you do that too. These
tools not only help me stay productive while away, they also ease the
trouble of using more than one computers between my office, my home
desktop, and my wife's laptop. Together they create a true virtual
development environment. While mobile and cloud computing technologies
are certainly useful, nothing beats old fashioned planning and
organizing. Plan ahead, prepare your work, and have them available with
you wherever you are. A lot can be done with plain pen and paper.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I have been weaning myself away from Microsoft products these past few
years. First to go was Microsoft Outlook. Then Microsoft Office. And
then recently, I am finally rid myself of the last Microsoft product
that I have--Windows XP. I have been using Ubuntu for the past two
months now. Linux is certainly a lot easier to use now than years ago
when Red Hat was the most popular distribution. I installed Ubuntu and
the system was ready to use. No more hunting for linux drivers or
installing packages one by one. Ubuntu was ready for use right off the
bat. The first couple of weeks was awkward as there are many differences
between Ubuntu and Windows. I often find myself searching online to see
how to perform some trivial tasks. Setting up the Ubuntu system to just
the way I wanted took some time and IT skills. But after the initial
learning curve of about a week, I am very satisfied. Both Windows and
Ubuntu have their pros and cons (there are plenty of comparisons online,
so I won't compare them here), I wouldn't say one is better than other.
As a skilled computer user, I am fine either way. The primary use of my
computer is for running my automated strategies and quant programming.
As such, system stability is a top priority for me. Which is why I
decided to try Linux in the first place. So far, Ubuntu hs lived up to
its expectations. I ran the JForex platform non-stop for days in
addition to my regular heavy usage without any hiccup or slowdown.
Having made the switch, I will be sticking with Ubuntu for the following
reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It works.</li>
<li>It is stable.</li>
<li>It is free.</li>
<li>It is fully customizable.</li>
<li>It integrates with other open source software that I use.</li>
<li>I like how it is always up-to-date to fix bugs and security holes.</li>
<li>It runs much better than XP (although that's an unfair comparison as
    XP is old).</li>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>I'm still recuperating from my food poisoning from last week. Meanwhile, I came across this unbelievable <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5481921/the-day-traders-paradise">trading workspace showcase</a> from LifeHacker.</p>
<p><img alt="40 monitors trading workspace" src="/images/img_archive/40montradingdesk.jpg" /></p>
<p>I have no idea how this trader can juggle 40 monitors during his day
trading. I am satisfied with just one 24" monitor on my desk. However,
I'm neither a day trader or a professional trader, so perhaps I'm
missing something?</p>
<p>What do you think of this 40 monitors setup? A dream come true or a
charts nightmare?</p> </div>
