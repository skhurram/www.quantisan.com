            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Many people dream of making a cash cow trading program and be set for
life. The reality of the business, which is just like any other
profession, is that you need to be persistent and persevere. You really
need to enjoy the work to be able to keep going at it day after day even
if nothing that you do seems to work at a time. This video by Tim
Harford explains why success starts with failure. It rings with my
previous post on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-secret-to-trading-system-development-is-to-fail-faster/">why the secret to trading system development is to
fail faster</a>.

Harford's three principles of success:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fail a lot.</li>
<li>Fail affordably.</li>
<li>Fail and fix early.</li>
</ol>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>If I am to offer only one advice with regard to developing trading
systems then this is it -- fail faster. The sad truth to trading is that
there is no magical system that can guarantee profitability
indefinitely. A reason top firms like Renaissance Technologies employ
hundreds of PhDs and is <a href="https://www.renfund.com/vm/jobs.vm">still actively hiring</a> is because one can
never reach the end of the rainbow in trading. A system can always be
made better or made obsolete. In fact, you need to stay ahead of the
curve as competitions are like vultures that will eat away your game if
you don't keep moving. Not to mention the changing dynamics of the
market itself is a moving target. As such, you simply need to keep
innovating. My way of innovating boils down to executing five cyclical
steps. Conceptualising, implementing, testing, measuring, and analysing,
over and over again. In essence, my innovation methodology is a
simulated annealing process that might or might not eventually lead to a
breakthrough. I do this because:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am intelligent but I am not a genius. As such, I don't expect
    myself to make leaps and bounds with regular sparks of genius.
    Instead, I take small steps. Adding a 1% yield to your system is
    extremely difficult. Adding 0.01% is a lot easier. Adding 0.0001% is
    almost pedantic. So I aim for achieving smaller improvements and do
    it hundreds of times over a development cycle.</li>
<li>My view of the world is not absolute. In fact, I am more often wrong
    than right. So it follows that most of my ideas don't have all the
    pieces right. Thus, it is inherent that I need to polish my ideas
    through trials and errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Failure is inevidentable when developing trading systems. It is part of
the process. You come up with an idea, implement it, test it, find out
why it isn't up to your expectation, and then make it better. So the
quicker you can fail and learn from it, the quicker you can discover
something useful.</p>
