            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I always try to keep my trading and any related costs as cheap as
possible. And there's nothing cheaper than free, which that is what
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is offering starting November 1, 2010. They
are offering a full year of free t1.micro EC2 instance along with other
basic level of AWS services (see link below). That seems to be a great
incentive to move my trading system on to a remote cloud server. One of
the biggest benefits of running your trading system on a virtual private
server or a cloud instance is reliability. I don't know about you, but
my internet connection sometimes acts up or even goes down for hours.
There's the occasional electrical power disruption too, but it's been
good these days. On the other hand, there are many disadvantages for
running your trading system remotely. Costs, technical know-hows, and
limited processing power, just to name a few. The added costs is not an
issue for now as Amazon is offering a year of free trial. With regard to
technical know-hows, I don't know how to setup a cloud server yet.
Although it shouldn't be a terribly difficult task for me as I am
familiar with Linux. What's at issue though, is the limited processing
power. The processing power of a t1.micro instance is an unspecified
fraction of one ECU, which is equivalent to a 1 GHz 2007 Intel Xeon
processor. So you get a fraction of that, which doesn't sound much.
CloudHarmony's benchmark shows that <a href="http://cloudharmony.com/benchmarks">a Micro instance is about 1/10th of
that of the Small instance</a>. However, a Micro instance can burst to up
to 2 ECUs (double that of the Small) of processing power occasionally.
This is good if you can keep your continuous processes minimal and only
make calculations infrequently (such as on arrival of a new price bar).
The t1.micro gets 613 MB of memory along with 10 GB of EBS (for
low-latency files) and 5 GB of S3 (for persistent storage). These
numbers are generous, so the bottleneck obviously remains with the
processor. Your best bet for minimal background processing use is to run
a command-line-only trading system. That's something that can be easily
done on JForex. However, there remains the question of is the minimum
power of a Micro sufficient to sustain a trading system? Any hiccup in a
trading system could cost you more than the annual charge for even a
Small instance. This freebie from Amazon may not be worth the risk. The
only way to know is to test it out. I won't be able to get to that soon
as I'm been busy programming. So if anyone is running a trading system
on a t1.micro instance, I'd really appreciate if you can provide some
feedback. Update Nov 6: See <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/first-time-setting-up-jforex-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">my first failed test</a> and then my first
time <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/i-got-jforex-running-smoothly-on-amazon-ec2-t1-micro/">running remote desktop on t1.micro</a>. Otherwise, enjoy the
freebie, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">AWS Free Usage Tier</a>.</p> </div>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just spent the last few hours looking into Google App Engine to use it
for trading. Google App Engine (GAE) is a cloud computing development
and hosting platform for web applications. GAE is similar to the
well-known Amazon EC2 service but it is also very different. The main
difference between GAE and EC2 is that GAE is not as flexible as EC2 but
it is a lot easier to develop on. Think of it like using C++ (EC2) to
write your own trading platform to using EasyLanguage on TradeStation or
MQL on Metatrader (GAE). Another advantage for using Google App Engine
is that it is free! Well, to a certain extent. It is free for a limited
monthly usage. However, Google's free quota is known to be very generous
(think Gmail) and this is no exception. Based on the numbers, it looks
comparable to a typical \$20/month virtual private server (VPS) hosting
package. My guess is that you can run a decent personal quant program on
it if you keep the resources for yourself (private use). For more
information on the free quota, you can read the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas.html">current GAE quota</a>
web page or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Engine">Wikipedia page for GAE</a>. You might be wondering how
did I spend a few hours just reading on GAE? The answer is that I've
done a brief research, planning, and assessment to see how GAE can be
put to use in terms of quantitative analysis for automated and
discretionary trading. Without going through all of my notes and logic,
here's the gist of my conclusion.</p>
<h2>For Automated Trading</h2>
<p>Since GAE is also a SDK, it has a restricted programming API. You can't
just plug in any custom library of your own (i.e. your broker's API)
into your program. That is its advantage and its disadvantage.
Furthermore, GAE only support HTTP and HTTPS. So you can't open a socket
for your connection either. These limitations won't be changing anytime
soon as GAE is designed to be like that for security reasons. Basically,
there's no way for your web application on GAE to connect with your
broker for trading. So much for that idea.</p>
<h2>For Discretionary Trading</h2>
<p>Things look brighter for discretionary trading though. A big bonus with
using Google App Engine is that it supports the Google Finance API.
Google Finance offers free real-time stock quotes. Combine it with the
programming capability of the Google App Engine and you have yourself a
free number cruncher in the cloud. However, GAE is definitely no match
for your personal computer, so why would you go through all that
trouble? One possible scenario in which this could be useful is for
traders that is often on the road or traders such as myself in which we
have a day job. In that case, you can set you quant analytics on GAE as
a private web application and then you can access it as a web page
anywhere on your mobile phone. One of the obvious limitation with using
GAE is that it has limited features for scientific computing. For
example, it doesn't support Numpy in the Python SDK. As such, I can't
imagine using GAE for anything more than simple technical analysis for
now. I certainly hope that GAE can include more powerful scientific
computing capabilities in the near future. Until then, I really can't
see Google App Engine offering much help aside from performing
algorithmic tasks to help with your trading analysis. Their open issues
log does announce that <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=190">Numpy is being integrated into GAE</a> though. So
that's a great sign for things to come! I am very hopeful of GAE's
potential as a free cloud server to host my quant analytics on. We'll
just have to wait for now.</p>
