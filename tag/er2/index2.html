            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6I6SxzQQpI/AAAAAAAAAMM/6d2AMKr4aC4/s400/er2_day.jpg" />][] What a day today. Volume was great and swings were huge too. I
had a good day today and covered my losses from yesterday. Good days
always seem to come after a bad day. I think it's probably because I'm
more calm after a losing day. So now, I just need to maintain my
composure even if I'm up.</p>
<p>MBIA had a conference call today and told everyone everything's still
good even though they are reporting a \$2.3bln loss last quarter! Go
figure! Someone at BillCara is suggesting that the fund managers are
proping the market because it's the last day of the month. Just so they
can have a positive January.</p>
<p>I traded the pre-market signal as intended and it paid off. The gap
closed as expected but I <span style="font-weight:bold;">exited too
early</span> again. If only I held longer, my profits would have been in
the 4 figures today.</p>
<p>I did well today, entering trades only when the risk/reward ratio is
deemed worthwhile. In addition, I am making use of resistance and
support levels. I think this helped a lot.</p>
<p>However, I think I need to be quicker on my decision. I found that many
times, I was still pondering should I enter and then the price have
moved already. On the other hand, my exit trigger is a bit too fast
because I'm still not letting my profit run. Thus, I think I need to
automate some of my decision making process (like adding some ShowMe's)
rather than just eyeballing my indicators. One idea I'm having is tune
my fast time period with an appropriate ShowMe. This should be something
simple. I am thinking of implementing a ShowMe for local high/low with
stochastic divergence as setup.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6DarxzQQjI/AAAAAAAAALc/MuuFkCxOuQU/s400/er2_daygraph.jpg" />][]A hell of a ride today from the FOMC at 2:15pm. The day was
pretty quiet before the announcement. Then at about 2:14pm, the price
broke up because the FED lowered interest rate another 50 pts to 3% as
expected.</p>
<p>I tried my scalping strategy explained a few days ago, it didn't work!
After losing about \$1000 in the past week on these scalping trades, I
think it's time to admit that I suck at it and stop doing it! A few
bucks here and a few there accumulated so quickly.
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Until I have thoroughly developed and
backtested a strategy, I should not use it in trading.</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, my Keltner + Stochastic strategy is working well. The
only problem now is that I need to be more confident about it and let my
profit run. See this graph below of this fading trade I took after the
price shot up on the FED outcome. I knew that it's going to come back
down to fill the gap. And I knew that I shouldn't be reading my fast
time frame. Instead, if I enter on the intermediate time frame, then I
should exit on the intermediate time frame too. I knew that the bounce
would take us to the other side of the channel but I exited way too
early because I looked at my fast time frame and lost confident.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R6DcshzQQkI/AAAAAAAAALk/Tb9XerDhN7A/s400/er2_dive.jpg" />][] The reason is that earlier today, I had full intention of
waiting for exit signal on the intermediate time frame, but the \$200
bounce ended up to be fake and I closed out at a little loss on that
trade. The price movement seemed the same at the time of my exit, so
that spooked me out of a potential \$700 more profit. I really shouldn't
let my loses cloud my judgement. I should just learn from it and move
on. In hindsight, the difference is that this afternoon trade had a HUGE
run prior to it and my CCI + Stochastic signal was on too, whereas the
moring losing trade only moved from mid channel and CCI signal wasn't
on. Lesson here is that <span style="font-weight:bold;">if there are
more than one BUY/SELL signal on, then the move would have higher
probability and would be bigger too</span>.</p>
<p>There's still a lot for me to learn.</p>

is happening today. As such, the day is mostly inside a trading range. I
should have taken the first SELL signal just before the open because it
was the biggest move. I didn't take it because it was before the day
session and I was worried of market manipulations.</p>
<p>However, upon looking at the past few days' of data, it seems that even
pre-market signals seem reliable on ER2. I will consider entering a
position outside of the day hours in the future.</p>
<p>Not much happened today. I sort of used Stochastic to try to trade
today, but it wasn't very reliable. In addition, I observed the price
movement and used mostly instinct and chart pattern to trade. It didn't
turn out too well but I did develop a new strategy based on it and it
seems to be good.</p>
<p>I realize that I need more strategies to capture more market movements.
Having just 1 setup is very limiting. I was down for most of the day but
made it back into the black after 3pm. The
<span style="font-weight:bold;">first hour or two and the last hour are
really good on ER2</span> because there are more activities and more
moves in those times.</p>
<p>I also looked at other markets today. The S&amp;P Midcap 400 seems good too
but it moves like the YM and ER2, so there's not much point in trading
it with ER2. It just doesn't provide diversification to trade heavily
correlated markets.</p>
<p>I also looked at some FX futures, but the ATR is too big. It would be
good to trade it on a longer term once I have enough capital.</p>
<p>For now, I'll stick with ER2 and try to develop more strategies.</p>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R55FWhzQQdI/AAAAAAAAAKU/EGtB6UIYZRE/s400/er2_day.jpg" />][]I thought of just mental trade today because it's my first day
at ER2. But then the signals were so good that I had to take a position.
It ended up well. I think this is a good way to limit myself, I simply
wouldn't trade until I thought I just had to take it.</p>
<p>Also, it seems that the first 2 hours and last 90 minutes of the day
session were easier to trade. The moves were more obvious.</p>
<p>Once I got my first trade in, I started to continue using my strategy.
However, like yesterday, there were many false positives. But unlike
yesterday, the price movements were less dramatic and I was able to inch
up my stop so even these wrong trades didn't eat me alive.</p>
<p>After like 3 or 4 false positives, I just stopped trading for the day
and watched Wall Street Warriors. Unfortunately, just minutes later, the
price finally broke and dived like I thought. It would have been an easy
\$700 there. The uptrend kept inching up until RUT broke 700 points (the
line of the bear, major resistance). I didn't think ER2 would break 700
so I entered at the hesitation ceiling but it broke. When ER2 is about
704 (RUT=701), there was another hesitation ceiling, I took a short and
got stopped out because I moved my stop to my entry. I thought the price
would go up again so I didn't try again. Then just a few minutes
afterward, the price finally broke down like I thought it would.</p>
<p>I could have entered a short at 703.80 and put a stop just above the
day's high, 704 something. It would have been a few pts of risk. But the
profit potential was high because we've been moving up all day and the
signals have been in OB for all day too. The break could have been
significant. I should have kept trying because the risk/reward were good
and both technical and fundamental were on my side.</p>
<p>What kept me from entering is remembering from last week's experience
with YM. False positives can easily eat out an account.</p>
<p>So lessons from today:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes it take a few tries for the price to break.</li>
<li>If risk/reward is really great and strategy says enter position, it
    might be worth another try.</li>
</ol>

lost money today.</p>
<p>Two reasons really:</p>
<ol>
<li>my stops are too tight</li>
<li>YM is too choppy</li>
</ol>
<p>I have cut down on erraneous trades but the false positives on the long
side today caught me many times. I don't think I'll be trading the Dow
from now on. Furthermore, the more I day trade, the more I want to
develop a trading system for mechanical trading. Day trading is giving
me experience and ideas for new strategies. I will get back on
programming soon.</p>
<p></p>
I have enabled CME data and will try the ER2 next week. I decided to
move to ER2 like I've always planned on. The only reason I haven't done
so earlier is that the stake is a lot higher there. But if I can trade
better there, then it'll be better than letting YM eat up a bit here and
a bit there even though it's \$5/pt. On the same day, here's the graph
for ER2. Notice that it's much nicer and fewer false signals, aka MM
traps.</p>
