            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R5_EwhzQQhI/AAAAAAAAALM/fV00XKRPbXs/s400/er2_day.jpg" />][]Everyone is waiting for the FOMC meeting tomorrow, so not much
is happening today. As such, the day is mostly inside a trading range. I
should have taken the first SELL signal just before the open because it
was the biggest move. I didn't take it because it was before the day
session and I was worried of market manipulations.</p>
<p>However, upon looking at the past few days' of data, it seems that even
pre-market signals seem reliable on ER2. I will consider entering a
position outside of the day hours in the future.</p>
<p>Not much happened today. I sort of used Stochastic to try to trade
today, but it wasn't very reliable. In addition, I observed the price
movement and used mostly instinct and chart pattern to trade. It didn't
turn out too well but I did develop a new strategy based on it and it
seems to be good.</p>
<p>I realize that I need more strategies to capture more market movements.
Having just 1 setup is very limiting. I was down for most of the day but
made it back into the black after 3pm. The
<span style="font-weight:bold;">first hour or two and the last hour are
really good on ER2</span> because there are more activities and more
moves in those times.</p>
<p>I also looked at other markets today. The S&amp;P Midcap 400 seems good too
but it moves like the YM and ER2, so there's not much point in trading
it with ER2. It just doesn't provide diversification to trade heavily
correlated markets.</p>
<p>I also looked at some FX futures, but the ATR is too big. It would be
good to trade it on a longer term once I have enough capital.</p>
<p>For now, I'll stick with ER2 and try to develop more strategies.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>[<img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Vlx60iTPx5s/R55FWhzQQdI/AAAAAAAAAKU/EGtB6UIYZRE/s400/er2_day.jpg" />][]I thought of just mental trade today because it's my first day
at ER2. But then the signals were so good that I had to take a position.
It ended up well. I think this is a good way to limit myself, I simply
wouldn't trade until I thought I just had to take it.</p>
<p>Also, it seems that the first 2 hours and last 90 minutes of the day
session were easier to trade. The moves were more obvious.</p>
<p>Once I got my first trade in, I started to continue using my strategy.
However, like yesterday, there were many false positives. But unlike
yesterday, the price movements were less dramatic and I was able to inch
up my stop so even these wrong trades didn't eat me alive.</p>
<p>After like 3 or 4 false positives, I just stopped trading for the day
and watched Wall Street Warriors. Unfortunately, just minutes later, the
price finally broke and dived like I thought. It would have been an easy
\$700 there. The uptrend kept inching up until RUT broke 700 points (the
line of the bear, major resistance). I didn't think ER2 would break 700
so I entered at the hesitation ceiling but it broke. When ER2 is about
704 (RUT=701), there was another hesitation ceiling, I took a short and
got stopped out because I moved my stop to my entry. I thought the price
would go up again so I didn't try again. Then just a few minutes
afterward, the price finally broke down like I thought it would.</p>
<p>I could have entered a short at 703.80 and put a stop just above the
day's high, 704 something. It would have been a few pts of risk. But the
profit potential was high because we've been moving up all day and the
signals have been in OB for all day too. The break could have been
significant. I should have kept trying because the risk/reward were good
and both technical and fundamental were on my side.</p>
<p>What kept me from entering is remembering from last week's experience
with YM. False positives can easily eat out an account.</p>
<p>So lessons from today:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes it take a few tries for the price to break.</li>
<li>If risk/reward is really great and strategy says enter position, it
    might be worth another try.</li>
</ol>

lost money today.</p>
<p>Two reasons really:</p>
<ol>
<li>my stops are too tight</li>
<li>YM is too choppy</li>
</ol>
<p>I have cut down on erraneous trades but the false positives on the long
side today caught me many times. I don't think I'll be trading the Dow
from now on. Furthermore, the more I day trade, the more I want to
develop a trading system for mechanical trading. Day trading is giving
me experience and ideas for new strategies. I will get back on
programming soon.</p>
<p></p>
I have enabled CME data and will try the ER2 next week. I decided to
move to ER2 like I've always planned on. The only reason I haven't done
so earlier is that the stake is a lot higher there. But if I can trade
better there, then it'll be better than letting YM eat up a bit here and
a bit there even though it's \$5/pt. On the same day, here's the graph
for ER2. Notice that it's much nicer and fewer false signals, aka MM
traps.</p>

My strategy for Dow should work on the ER2 too. Moreover, ER2 seems to
be more straightforward and easier to trade. It really does seem like a
nice market to trade. I'll continue to keep an eye on it.</p>
