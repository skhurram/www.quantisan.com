            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I am shorting again. This time on Manulife Financial (MFC.TO) with a
January 2011 put at 14 strike price. MFC is trading at \$13.25 at time
of entry. Recent series of <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-bank-story-no-one-is-talking-about-2010-09-10">prop desk closings</a> isn't going to bode
well for the market, particularly for the banks as they need to
recuperate those easy income. On top of it, the lack of push from the
bulls this week as S&amp;P test 1110 resistance doesn't look promising
either. Yet, this could very well be a bear trap. In any case, I am
taking a bearish bet via shorting MFC. Figure 1 shows a chart of MFC. It
is depressed and it is struggling. Moreover, MFC keeps announcing
billions of dollars worth of share offerings lately. I like it. There is
a distinct possibility of a bear raid if MFC can break this \$13.50
resistance level. The gap above \$15 is just staring at me. Hard stop is
at \$1.00 premium. Worst case risk for this trade is thus (\$1.70 -
\$1.00) * 4 * 100 = 280 + \$27.90 commission = \$307.90 = 3.2%.
However, I'd be very cautious if MFC closes above \$13.50. [caption

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Well I found a viable long term hold just as I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/still-waiting-on-the-sideside-in-my-rrsp/">declared that there's
nothing good out there</a> today. Yes, I eat my words often. So I took a
long position in Ventana Gold Corp (VEN.TO). That cup-and-handle
breakout from \$9.00 is just textbook (Fig. 1). I am indeed a bit late,
but the trend is now upward. There is a big resistance at \$10. It is
where the June epic decline started. From just above \$10 to \$6.5
between June and July. Now that VEN is back at this level again. I am
betting that the positive momentum would carry it upward. My hard stop
is \$8.90. My mental stop is \$9.50. As VEN seem to like to gap at
\$9.50. From the look of it, \$9.50 level is more important than \$10.
Since we're above it already, this gives me a bit more confidence in
this trade. Another point to note is gold price. It is on a direct train
to test, and possibly, break a new high record (Fig. 2). Risk is (\$9.74
- \$8.90) * 200 = \$168 + \$9.90 commission = \$177.90 = 1.85% of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">RRSP

            <div class="article-content"> <p>As much as I rant about trading and forex, a big portion of my
investment funds are in a <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/questrade/">Questrade RRSP trading account</a> for the
long haul. However, that account has been dormant for a few weeks now.
The money is just sitting there, not even making any interest. The
reason is that I am just not seeing any long-term opportunity on either
long or short just yet. Even though the month of September started well
after Labour Day, as the market is inching higher, the long term picture
is still unclear. Figure 1 below clearly shows that not much has really
happened for the whole year. There was a lot of volatility as TSX swings
up and down a thousand points now and then. Evidently, a buy-and-hold
strategy wouldn't have been doing too well this year. As such, I am
waiting with no position in hand. At least I'm not going <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/sold-6-cm-10oct-put-74-00-6-60-mark-70-70-8-0/">all out
shorting the equity market</a> anymore.</p>

honour comes <a href="http://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/contests/strategy_contest/august-2010/">a \$5,000 grand prize</a> in real greenbacks. The setup
that I used is a minor updated version of <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/jforex-example-dual-timeframe-moving-averages-setup/">the one I used last month</a>.
I continue to adapt my system to expect market conditions of the month
ahead. Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong. This contest is turning
out to be more than a nerdy pass time for me as I have finished in the
top 10 three times already since it started in April. However, I must
reiterate the fact that this is not real trading. It's just a paper
trading contest with no real money risked on my part. If I'm really that
good at trading to make 45% of return a month, I wouldn't be writing
this post at lunch in my cubicle at this moment. So yes, back to reality
as I continue my engineering work while improving my own trading and
developing my quantitative trading system in my spare time. As my blog's
tagline reads, this is an engineer's training to trade for a living.</p> </div>

                <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/on-technical-analysis-and-fuzzy-logic-for-mechanical-trading/" rel='bookmark'>On technical analysis and fuzzy logic for mechanical trading</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Technical traders realize that technical analysis is more of an art than
science. Until you draw a plethora of lines to fill your chart, which
would render it practically useless, prices rarely "hit the spot" based
on your doodles. This doesn't matter though because trading is not about
charts and guessing numbers. It is about costs and risks (pardon me if
you've heard this a thousand times already). To whom this would matter
though, are the mechanical traders using technical analysis. It may be
<em>obvious</em> to a human to discern price patterns because a trading setup
<em>looks like</em> something you know. However, figuring out "obvious" and
"looks like" is not trivial in a program. Common ways of tackling this
problem is with stochastic algorithms or Bayesian logic. The drawback
with using these methods though, is that they are difficult to conjure
unless you have some vigorous background in math. Hereby I suggest an
alternative--fuzzy logic. In it's simplest implmentation, fuzzy logic
are mere if-then statements. Here's a sample fuzzy logic control system
for regulating temperature with a fan (it is also a trick solution to
the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis">hysteresis problem</a> in control theory...but I
digress),<code>IF temperature IS very cold THEN stop fan IF temperature IS cold THEN turn down fan IF temperature IS normal THEN maintain level IF temperature IS hot THEN speed up fan</code>
As you can see, there can be more than two values for a result. The
classic and ubiquitous TRUE or FALSE boolean is thrown out the window.
Let's dive right into an example of applying fuzzy logic to technical
analysis. Say you are using the RSI as one of your indicators.
Typically, you set a pair of threshold values to determine if the
instrument is overbought or oversold.
<code>String rsiCondition; if (RSI &gt; 70) rsiCondition = "Overbought"; if (RSI &gt;= 30 &amp;&amp; RSI &lt;= 70) rsiCondition = "Neutral"; if (RSI &lt; 30) rsiCondition = "Oversold";</code>
Then here is what a fuzzy logic implementation would look
like.<code>String rsiCondition; if (RSI &gt; 90) rsiCondition = "Very overbought!"; if (RSI &gt; 70) rsiCondition = "Overbought"; if (RSI &gt; 60) rsiCondition = "a little overbought"; if (RSI &gt;= 40 &amp;&amp; RSI &lt;= 60) rsiCondition = "Neutral"; if (RSI &lt; 40) rsiCondition = "a little oversold"; if (RSI &lt; 30) rsiCondition = "Oversold"; if (RSI &lt; 10) rsiCondition = "Very oversold!";</code>
In fact, you may have noticed that the first RSI example is already a
3-valued fuzzy logic. And you're right! Fuzzy logic is that easy. So
what can you do with that second RSI example? Well, perhaps you want to
implement fuzzy logic on a MACD as a second indicator. Then you can
implement a "conviction" algorithm (which isn't possible with TRUE/FALSE
algorithms) by summing the two fuzzy logic (see wiki or google for more
information on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">performing fuzzy logic operations</a>). And then... well.
This is a basic example of exploiting the benefits of fuzzy logic in
automated trading strategies. More advanced use of fuzzy logic is
demonstrated in this seminal work by Lin and Lee, <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=106218&amp;tag=1">Neural-network-based
fuzzy logic control and decision system</a>, 1991. Fuzzy logic + neural
net! Well, as you can see, this is only the tip of the iceberg. P.S. I
have discussed a lot recently about the frontend work that I have been
working on. This post is a break for the reader and a glimpse at what I
am really doing behind the scenes. Let me know in the <a href="#respond">comments below</a>
if this is your cup of tea and I'll write more of this type of posts in
the future.</p> </div>

<p>The reason why I took this trade was that the opportunity seemed too
good to pass on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/short-usdcad-1-0654-stop-1-077/">based on my analysis at the time</a>. I
always keep an eye on the market even when I'm not trading. Although the
basic setup remains intact, the opportunity isn't so fantastic that I
couldn't say no anymore.</p>
<p>Anyway, I shouldn't be wasting time managing a minuscule trade. Back to
