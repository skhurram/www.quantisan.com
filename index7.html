            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Many people dream of making a cash cow trading program and be set for
life. The reality of the business, which is just like any other
profession, is that you need to be persistent and persevere. You really
need to enjoy the work to be able to keep going at it day after day even
if nothing that you do seems to work at a time. This video by Tim
Harford explains why success starts with failure. It rings with my
previous post on <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/the-secret-to-trading-system-development-is-to-fail-faster/">why the secret to trading system development is to
fail faster</a>.

<li>Fail a lot.</li>
<li>Fail affordably.</li>
<li>Fail and fix early.</li>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>If I am to offer only one advice with regard to developing trading
systems then this is it -- fail faster. The sad truth to trading is that
there is no magical system that can guarantee profitability
indefinitely. A reason top firms like Renaissance Technologies employ
hundreds of PhDs and is <a href="https://www.renfund.com/vm/jobs.vm">still actively hiring</a> is because one can
never reach the end of the rainbow in trading. A system can always be
made better or made obsolete. In fact, you need to stay ahead of the
curve as competitions are like vultures that will eat away your game if
you don't keep moving. Not to mention the changing dynamics of the
market itself is a moving target. As such, you simply need to keep
innovating. My way of innovating boils down to executing five cyclical
steps. Conceptualising, implementing, testing, measuring, and analysing,
over and over again. In essence, my innovation methodology is a
simulated annealing process that might or might not eventually lead to a
breakthrough. I do this because:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am intelligent but I am not a genius. As such, I don't expect
    myself to make leaps and bounds with regular sparks of genius.
    Instead, I take small steps. Adding a 1% yield to your system is
    extremely difficult. Adding 0.01% is a lot easier. Adding 0.0001% is
    almost pedantic. So I aim for achieving smaller improvements and do
    it hundreds of times over a development cycle.</li>
<li>My view of the world is not absolute. In fact, I am more often wrong
    than right. So it follows that most of my ideas don't have all the
    pieces right. Thus, it is inherent that I need to polish my ideas
    through trials and errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Failure is inevidentable when developing trading systems. It is part of
the process. You come up with an idea, implement it, test it, find out
why it isn't up to your expectation, and then make it better. So the
quicker you can fail and learn from it, the quicker you can discover
something useful.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Here are some server monitoring graphs from my remote trading server.
These graphs are produced by the server monitoring application,
<a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a>. I ran both JForex and Metatrader 4 simultaneously on my
server last week. The 512 MB of memory was noticeably insufficient.
Which caused the system to use swap files, thus leading to I/O latency,
and which held up the CPU. All of which are evident from the graphs
below. This week I am only running JForex. The server load is within
tolerable range. The thing with picking your own VPS is that no VPS
provider is the same. You can't really compare just the numbers as there
are just too many factors to be considered behind the scene on a VPS
service. So it is important to run applications that you intend to run
and stress your system in real-world conditions. If your system seems
slow, figure out where exactly is the bottleneck before throwing away
money for upgrades. This is where a server monitoring application comes
handy. [caption id="attachment_5437" align="aligncenter" width="497"

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>I just finished porting <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/quantised-trading-desk/">Quantised Trading Desk</a> to Metatrader 4. So
that I can make use of my dormant trading account at Oanda. Seeing that
Oanda has enabled use of Metatrader 4, I thought I might <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-staying-with-oanda-a-while-longer-before-moving-to-dukascopy/">give them a
second try</a>. I've always preferred to have more than one active
trading accounts to serve as a backup and comparison. I settled on
Questrade and TD Waterhouse for stocks and options, after hopping around
brokerages for years. And I've been using Dukascopy to trade forex
<a href="http://www.quantisan.com/in-a-forex-brokers-and-trading-platforms-jumble/">after much contention</a>. This is a good chance to diversify as I don't
want to pigeonhole myself into one broker and one platform. The move to
Metatrader 4 up until this point only took a couple of weeks as opposed
to JForex version's year-long development time. This is because the
underlying QTD system dynamics and algorithms were ironed out in JForex.
I don't think I can finish QTD if I only had MQL4 at my disposal.
Debugging and extending MQL4 scripts are a nightmare to say the least. I
am so glad that I <a href="http://www.quantisan.com/why-i-am-not-a-big-fan-of-mql4-or-trading-platform-scripting/">moved away from these "easy" languages</a>. For the
MQL4 version of QTD, I am merely doing a direct source code port from
JForex to MQL4. MQL4, if anything else, is a very easy scripting
language. I just taped out an alpha version of MT4 QTD this weekend as
it is up to a stage where it is functional. However, porting QTD to MQL4
isn't without its difficulties. For one, MQL4 is tailored for simple
trading with technical analysis indicators. If price move above moving
average, go long, for example. Whereas QTD rely on statistics and
numerical methods in its trading algorithm. As such, I had to go back to
basics and define all of my numerical methods from the fundamentals. I
am now moving on to do forward testing on the MT4 QTD to ensure that
both the JForex and the MT4 versions work similarly. I can't wait til I
can run QTD on Dukascopy and Oanda simultaneously.</p> </div>

            <div class="article-content"> <p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703864204576317060246641834.html">case of Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam</a> shows a corporate
security crack that shouldn't happen in this day and age. In the
Rajaratnam case, government wiretaps served as vital evidence against
him. The question though, is that, if the government is able to do that
on a multi-billion dollar company without them knowing, what about their
competitors or enemies with ill-intent? With all the resources available
to them, how can something so old-school like this happen to a hedge
fund? Secrecy and conspiracy shouldn't be unfamiliar in the hedge fund
industry. So I had assumed that they operated inside an iron wall.
Government wiretapping or corporate espionage are certainly not my
worry. However, I still try to employ prudent security procedures in the
financial quantitative research and development that I do at Quantisan
Systems just because I value my intellectual property. For example, in
my email correspondence with business associates, I make use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a>
with a 2048-bit RSA asynchronous key pair. (my public key is below) GPG
is an open-source equivalent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">Pretty Good Privacy</a>. It is most
likely that your email client supports it too. I use Thunderbird and it
is a built-in feature. You just need to enable it and set it up. On
voice communications, I prefer to use Skype rather than regular voice
calls because it's free and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_security">Skype inherently uses 256-bit AES
encryption</a>. So no setup is even required for this added security. For
my important files, I place them in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt">TrueCrypt volume</a> encrypted
with 256-bit AES encryption. The encrypted container is synchronized to
my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTYwMjg4MDY5/">Dropbox</a> account so that I can use it anywhere while ensuring
security. TrueCrypt is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It's only a
matter of following the installation instructions to safeguard your
files from prying eyes. All of these encryption tools are open-source
and free. I configured them to work in the background and they don't
hinder my work flow at all. It is certainly not a sophisticated setup,
yet it isn't too dingy either. At the very least, if someone is to steal
my notebook computer, an ordinary crook wouldn't be able to gain access
to my sensitive information. In view of the fact that Quantisan Systems
is just an one-man operation with practically no resource available, I
can't believe security at some financial companies is worse than this
homebrew setup. -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Version: GnuPG
